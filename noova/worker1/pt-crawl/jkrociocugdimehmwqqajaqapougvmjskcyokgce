exquisite</h1>when 
he 
discusses 
politics-you 
should 
see 
<a href="/UJ2p.html">his
gravity!"

He</a> 
sat 
down 
beside 
Hippolyte 
and 
wrinkling 
his 
forehead 
began 
talking
to 
him 
about 
politics. 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
the 
others 
gathered 
round 
these
two.

"The 
Berlin 
cabinet 
cannot 
express 
a 
feeling 
of 
alliance," 
began
Hippolyte 
gazing 
round 
with 
importance 
at 
the 
others, 
"without
expressing... 
as 
in 
its 
last 
note... 
you 
understand... 
Besides, 
unless
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
derogates 
from 
the 
principle 
of 
our 
alliance...

"Wait, 
I 
have 
not 
finished..." 
he 
said 
to 
Prince 
Andrew, 
seizing
him 
by 
the 
arm, 
"I 
believe 
that 
intervention 
will 
be 
stronger 
than
nonintervention. 
And..." 
he 
paused. 
"Finally 
one 
cannot 
impute 
the
nonreceipt 
of 
our 
dispatch 
of 
November 
18. 
That 
is 
how 
<a href="/LE4.html">it</a> 
will 
end."
And 
he 
released 
Bolkonski's 
arm 
to 
indicate 
that 
he 
had 
now 
quite
finished.

"Demosthenes, 
I 
know 
thee 
by 
the 
pebble 
thou 
<a href="/ND3.html">secretest</a> 
in 
thy 
golden
mouth!" 
said 
Bilibin, 
and 
the 
mop 
of 
hair 
on 
his 
head 
moved 
with
satisfaction.

Everybody 
laughed, 
and 
Hippolyte 
louder 
than 
anyone. 
He 
was 
evidently
distressed, 
and 
breathed 
painfully, 
but 
could 
not 
restrain 
the 
wild
laughter 
that 
convulsed 
his 
usually 
impassive 
features.

"Well 
now, 
gentlemen," 
said 
Bilibin, 
"Bolkonski 
is 
my 
guest 
in
this 
house 
and 
in 
Bruenn 
itself. 
I 
want 
to 
entertain 
him 
as 
far 
<a href="/">as</a> 
I
can, 
with 
all 
the 
pleasures 
of 
life 
here. 
If 
we 
were 
in 
Vienna 
it 
would
be 
easy, 
but 
here, 
in 
this 
wretched 
Moravian 
hole, 
it<p>
is 
more 
<a href="/ItU5tEu.html">difficult,
and</a> 
I 
beg 
you 
all 
to 
help 
me. 
<a href="/ItU5tEu.html">Bruenn's</a> 
attractions 
must 
be 
<a href="/SL7sCi.html">shown</a> 
him.
You 
can 
undertake 
the 
theater, 
I 
society, 
and 
you, 
Hippolyte, 
of 
course
the 
women."

"We 
must 
let 
him 
see 
Amelie, 
she's 
exquisite!" 
said 
one 
of
"ours," 
<a href="/ItU5tEu.html">kissing</a> 
his 
finger 
tips.

"In 
general 
we 
must 
turn 
this 
bloodthirsty<p>
soldier 
to 
more 
humane
interests," 
said 
Bilibin.

"I 
shall 
scarcely 
be 
able 
to 
avail 
myself 
of 
your 
hospitality,
gentlemen, 
it 
is 
already 
time 
for 
me 
to 
go," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew
looking 
at 
his 
watch.

"Where 
to?"

"To 
the 
Emperor."

"Oh! 
Oh! 
Oh!"

"Well, 
au 
revoir, 
Bolkonski! 
Au 
revoir, 
Prince! 
Come 
back 
early 
to
dinner," 
cried 
several 
voices. 
"We'll 
take 
you 
in 
hand."

"When 
speaking 
to 
the 
Emperor, 
try 
as 
far 
as 
you 
can 
to 
praise 
the 
way
that 
provisions 
are 
supplied 
and 
<a href="/SL7sCi.html">the</a> 
routes 
indicated," 
said 
Bilibin,
accompanying 
him 
to 
the 
hall.

"I 
should 
like 
<a href="/">to</a> 
speak 
well 
of 
them, 
but 
as 
far 
as 
I 
<a href="/xr6yf.html">know</a> 
the 
facts,
I 
can't," 
replied 
Bolkonski, 
smiling.

"Well, 
talk 
as 
much 
as 
you 
can, 
anyway. 
He 
<a href="/UJ2p.html">has</a> 
a 
passion 
for 
giving
audiences, 
but<p>
he 
does 
not 
like 
talking 
himself 
and 
can't 
do 
it, 
as
you 
will 
see."





CHAPTER 
XII

At 
the 
levee 
Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
among 
the 
Austrian 
officers 
as 
he 
had
been 
told 
to, 
and 
the 
Emperor 
Francis 
merely 
looked 
fixedly 
into 
his
face 
and 
just 
nodded 
to 
him 
with 
his 
long 
head. 
But 
after 
it 
was
over, 
the 
adjutant 
he 
had 
seen 
the 
previous 
day 
ceremoniously 
informed
Bolkonski 
that 
the 
Emperor 
desired 
to 
give 
him 
an 
audience. 
The 
Emperor
Francis 
received 
him 
standing 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
<a href="/ItU5tEu.html">room.</a> 
Before 
the
conversation 
began 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
struck 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
Emperor
seemed
