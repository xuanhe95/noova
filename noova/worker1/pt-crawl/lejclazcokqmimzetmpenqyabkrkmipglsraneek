to 
remain 
on 
duty,</h1>and 
hardly 
able
to 
drag 
their 
legs 
went 
to 
the 
front 
rather 
than 
to 
the 
hospitals.
When 
spring 
came 
on, 
the 
soldiers 
found 
a 
plant 
just 
showing 
out 
of 
the
ground 
that 
looked 
like 
asparagus, 
which, 
for 
some 
reason, 
they 
called
"Mashka's 
sweet 
root." 
It 
was 
very 
bitter, 
but 
they 
wandered
about 
the 
fields 
seeking 
it 
and 
dug 
it 
out 
with 
their 
sabers 
and 
ate 
it,
though 
they 
were 
ordered<p>
not 
to 
do 
so, 
as 
it 
was 
a 
noxious 
plant. 
That
spring 
a 
new 
disease 
broke 
out 
among 
the 
soldiers, 
a 
swelling 
of 
the
arms, 
legs, 
and 
face, 
which 
the 
doctors 
attributed 
to 
eating 
this 
root.
But 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
this, 
the 
soldiers 
of 
Denisov's 
squadron 
fed
chiefly 
on 
"Mashka's 
sweet 
root," 
because 
it 
was 
the 
second 
week
that 
the 
last 
of 
the 
biscuits 
were 
being 
doled 
out 
at 
the 
rate 
of 
half 
a
pound 
a 
man 
and 
the 
last 
potatoes 
received 
had 
sprouted 
and 
frozen.

The 
horses 
also 
had 
been 
fed 
for 
a 
fortnight 
on 
straw 
from 
the 
thatched
roofs 
and 
had 
become 
terribly 
thin, 
though<p>
still 
covered 
with 
tufts 
of
felty 
winter 
hair.

Despite 
this 
destitution, 
the 
soldiers 
and 
officers 
went 
on 
living 
just
as 
usual. 
Despite 
their 
pale 
swollen 
faces 
and 
tattered 
uniforms, 
the
hussars 
formed 
line 
for 
roll 
call, 
kept 
things 
<a href="/ND3.html">in</a> 
order, 
groomed 
their
horses, 
polished 
their 
arms, 
brought 
in 
straw 
from 
the 
thatched 
roofs 
in
place 
of 
fodder, 
and 
sat 
down 
to 
dine 
round 
the 
caldrons 
from 
which
they 
rose 
up 
hungry, 
joking 
about 
their 
nasty 
food 
and 
their 
hunger. 
As
usual, 
in 
their 
spare 
time, 
they 
lit 
bonfires, 
steamed 
themselves 
before
them 
naked; 
smoked, 
picked 
out 
and 
baked<p>
sprouting 
rotten 
potatoes, 
told
and 
listened 
to 
stories 
of 
Potemkin's 
and 
Suvorov's 
campaigns, 
or
to 
legends 
of 
Alesha 
the 
Sly, 
or 
the 
priest's 
laborer 
Mikolka.

The 
officers, 
as 
usual, 
lived 
in 
twos 
and 
threes 
in 
the 
roofless,
half-ruined 
houses. 
The 
seniors 
tried 
to 
collect 
straw 
and 
potatoes 
and,
in 
general, 
food 
for 
the 
men. 
The 
younger 
ones 
occupied 
themselves 
as
before, 
some 
playing 
cards 
(there 
was 
plenty 
of 
money, 
though 
there 
was
no 
food), 
some 
with 
more 
innocent 
games, 
such 
as 
quoits 
and 
skittles.
The 
general 
trend 
of 
the 
campaign 
was 
rarely 
spoken 
of, 
partly 
because
nothing 
certain 
was 
known 
about 
it, 
partly 
because 
there 
was 
a 
vague
feeling 
that 
in 
the 
main 
it 
was 
going 
badly.

Rostov 
lived, 
as 
before, 
with 
Denisov, 
and 
since 
their 
furlough 
they
had 
become 
more 
friendly 
than 
ever. 
Denisov 
never<p>
spoke 
of 
Rostov's
family, 
but 
by 
the 
tender 
friendship 
his 
commander 
showed 
him, 
Rostov
felt 
that 
the 
elder 
hussar's 
luckless 
love 
for 
Natasha 
played 
a 
part
in 
strengthening 
their 
friendship. 
Denisov 
evidently 
tried 
to 
expose
Rostov 
to 
danger<p>
as 
seldom 
as 
possible, 
and 
after 
an 
action 
greeted 
his
safe 
return 
with 
evident 
joy. 
On 
one 
of 
his 
foraging 
expeditions, 
in
a 
deserted 
and 
ruined 
village 
to 
which 
he 
had 
come 
in 
search 
of
provisions, 
Rostov 
found 
a 
family 
consisting 
of 
an 
old 
Pole 
and 
his
daughter 
with 
an 
infant 
in 
arms. 
They 
were 
half 
clad, 
hungry, 
too 
weak
to 
get 
away 
on 
foot 
and 
had 
no 
means 
of 
obtaining 
a 
conveyance. 
Rostov
brought 
them 
to 
his 
quarters, 
placed 
them 
in 
his 
own 
lodging, 
and
kept 
them 
for 
some 
weeks 
while 
the 
old 
man 
was 
recovering. 
One 
of 
his
comrades, 
talking 
of 
women, 
began 
chaffing 
Rostov, 
saying 
that 
he 
was
more 
wily 
than 
any 
of 
them 
and 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
bad 
thing 
if 
he
introduced 
to 
them
