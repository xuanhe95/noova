solemn 
affair. 
Every<p>
general</h1>and 
every 
soldier 
was 
conscious 
of 
his 
own
insignificance, 
aware 
of 
being 
but 
a 
drop 
in 
that 
ocean<p>
of 
men, 
and
yet 
at 
the 
same 
time 
was 
conscious 
of 
his 
strength 
as 
a 
part 
of 
that
enormous 
whole.

From 
early 
morning 
strenuous 
activities 
and 
efforts 
had 
begun 
and 
by 
ten
o'clock 
all 
had 
been 
brought 
into 
due 
order. 
The 
ranks 
were 
drawn
up 
on 
the 
vast 
field. 
The 
whole 
army 
was 
extended 
in 
three 
lines: 
the
cavalry 
in 
front, 
behind 
it 
the 
artillery, 
and 
behind 
that 
again 
the
infantry.

A 
space 
like 
a 
street 
was 
left 
between 
each 
two 
lines 
of 
troops. 
The
three 
parts 
of 
that 
army 
were 
sharply 
distinguished: 
Kutuzov's
fighting 
army 
(with 
the 
Pavlograds 
on 
the 
right 
flank 
<a href="/CN9CmwX.html">of</a> 
the 
front);
those 
recently 
arrived 
from 
Russia, 
both 
Guards 
and 
regiments 
of 
the
line; 
and 
the 
Austrian 
troops. 
But 
they 
all 
stood 
in 
the 
same 
lines,
under 
one 
command, 
and 
in 
a 
like 
order.

Like 
wind 
over 
leaves 
ran 
an 
excited 
whisper: 
"They're 
coming!
They're 
coming!" 
Alarmed 
voices 
were 
heard, 
and 
a 
stir 
of 
final
preparation 
swept 
over 
all 
the 
troops.

From 
the 
direction 
of 
Olmuetz 
in 
front 
of 
them, 
a 
group 
was 
seen
approaching. 
And 
at 
that 
moment, 
though 
the 
day 
was 
still, 
a 
light 
gust
of 
wind 
blowing 
over 
the 
army 
slightly 
stirred 
the 
streamers 
on 
the
lances 
and 
the 
unfolded 
standards 
fluttered 
against 
their 
staffs. 
It
looked 
as 
if 
by 
that 
slight 
motion 
the 
army 
itself 
was 
expressing 
its
joy 
at 
the 
approach 
of 
the 
Emperors. 
One 
voice 
was 
heard 
shouting:
"Eyes 
front!" 
Then, 
like 
the 
crowing 
of 
cocks 
at 
sunrise, 
this 
was
repeated 
by 
others 
from 
various 
sides 
and 
all 
became 
silent.

In 
the 
deathlike 
stillness 
only 
the 
tramp<p>
of 
horses 
was 
heard. 
This
was 
the<p>
Emperors' 
suites. 
The 
Emperors 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
flank, 
and 
the
trumpets 
of 
the 
first 
cavalry 
regiment 
played 
the 
general 
march. 
It
seemed 
as 
though 
not 
the 
trumpeters 
were 
playing, 
but 
as 
if 
the 
army
itself, 
rejoicing 
at 
the 
Emperors' 
approach, 
had 
naturally 
burst 
into
music. 
Amid 
these 
sounds, 
only 
the 
youthful 
kindly 
voice 
of 
the 
Emperor
Alexander 
was 
clearly 
heard. 
He 
gave 
the 
words 
of 
greeting, 
and 
the
first 
regiment 
roared 
"Hurrah!" 
so 
deafeningly, 
continuously, 
and
joyfully 
that 
the 
men 
themselves 
were 
awed 
by 
their 
multitude 
and 
the
immensity 
of 
the 
power 
they 
constituted.

Rostov, 
standing 
in 
the 
front 
lines 
of 
Kutuzov's 
army 
which 
the 
Tsar
approached 
first, 
experienced 
the 
same 
feeling 
as 
every 
other 
man 
in
that 
army: 
a 
feeling 
of 
self-forgetfulness, 
a 
proud 
consciousness 
of
might, 
and 
a 
passionate 
attraction 
to 
him 
who 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
this
triumph.

He 
<a href="/SL7sCi.html">felt</a> 
that 
at 
a 
single 
word 
from 
that 
man 
all 
this 
vast 
mass 
(and 
he
himself 
an 
insignificant 
atom 
<a href="/ND3.html">in</a> 
it) 
would 
go 
through 
fire 
and 
water,
commit 
crime, 
die, 
or 
perform 
deeds 
<a href="/LE4.html">of</a> 
highest 
heroism, 
and 
so 
he 
could
not 
but 
tremble 
and 
his 
heart 
stand 
still 
at 
the 
imminence 
of 
that 
word.

"Hurrah! 
Hurrah! 
Hurrah!" 
thundered 
from 
all 
sides, 
one 
regiment
after 
another 
greeting 
the 
Tsar 
with 
the 
strains 
of 
the 
march, 
and 
then
"Hurrah!"... 
Then 
the 
general 
march, 
and 
again 
"Hurrah! 
Hurrah!"
growing 
ever 
stronger 
and 
fuller 
and 
merging 
into 
a 
deafening 
roar.

Till 
the 
Tsar 
reached 
it, 
each 
regiment 
in 
its 
silence 
and
