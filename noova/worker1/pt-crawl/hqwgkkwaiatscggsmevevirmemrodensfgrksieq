so you can refer to them later in a list you can optionally add a short comment and share your check in with your friends on popular social networks how do i check in checking in is easy on&nbsp almost &nbsp every title on imdb there is a&nbsp share &nbsp link in the upper right of the page click it and a menu will appear with&nbsp check in &nbsp as one of the options if you re registered with imdb you can click this button and follow the appropriate prompting to submit a check in if you re not registered and logged in you ll be prompted to do so before you can check in for the first time why is the check in button missing on some titles there are a few special cases where we don t allow a check in the most prominent of these is for titles that have yet to be released we allow votes a few weeks before the general theatrical release and it is the same for check ins can i check in for an entire tv series or individual tv episodes or both with the above exception you can check in for both individual episodes and entire series or both as you see fit how do i access my list of check ins check ins can be accessed by navigating to the&nbsp your lists&nbsp page and click your checkins are my check ins public yes they are public your check ins are held in a&nbsp publicly available url &nbsp that&nbsp anyone &nbsp with a web browser can see unlike our other lists you&nbsp do not &nbsp currently have the option for private check ins please be mindful of this if you check in for titles that you are not keen for others to know you are watching however you do have the option to delete any title you ve checked in on the your check ins page how do i reorder my list you cannot reorder a check in list the check in is the order you ve seen titles in time it would not make sense to adjust the time however you can delete titles how do i share my check in list to share your check in list please navigate to the&nbsp your lists &nbsp page and click your checkins on the your checkins page click the x formerly twitter icon in the section share this list you can also share a list with your friends by copying the url from your browser and sending it to your friends via email can i see who looked at my lists/how many people read my lists yes to see how many people have viewed and commented on each list look for the list activity box at the top of the right hand column of the list page what happens to my check in list if i delete my account when you delete your account we remove your name and user id but your check in list url will remain active you will not able to modify it after the account is delete and if you reinstate your account with a new account id you will not be able to recover your check ins may i have more than one check in list no there is only one check in list per user at this time can i check in for something i have seen long ago our favored use of this feature is for titles you are currently seeing however there is nothing to prevent you from using this as a&nbsp seen it &nbsp list for all the titles you have seen since childhood however be aware that may be spamming your friends if you do a lot all at once and choose to share them via a social network can i check in for something i will see shortly absolutely go ahead an check in for a film you ll see at a theater tonight and put in the comment whether you want your friends to join you and where they should meet then publish it to a social network or use it to gather friends at your house how can i export my check in list to a different format such as a text format you can export your list to rss by clicking on the small orange square near the header of your list rss is a portable standard format which you can easily use with a variety of programs you can also export a list to csv comma separated values file by using the export link at the bottom right hand corner of the list you can then use the csv to look at your list in a spreadsheet program like excel how do i
