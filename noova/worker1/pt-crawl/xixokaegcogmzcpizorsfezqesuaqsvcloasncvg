and 
so 
it 
is 
possible 
to 
find 
some 
connection 
between 
the 
intellectual
activity 
of 
men 
and 
their 
historical 
movements, 
just 
as 
such 
a
connection 
may 
be 
found 
between 
the 
movements 
of 
humanity 
and 
commerce,
handicraft, 
gardening, 
or 
anything 
else 
you 
please. 
But 
why 
intellectual
activity 
is 
considered 
by 
the 
historians 
of 
culture 
to 
be 
the 
cause 
or
expression 
of 
the 
whole 
historical 
movement 
is 
hard 
to 
understand.
Only 
the 
following 
considerations 
can 
have 
led 
<a href="/Cv1epgGc.html">the</a> 
historians 
to 
such
a 
conclusion: 
(1) 
that 
history 
is 
written 
by 
learned 
men, 
and 
so 
it 
is
natural 
and 
agreeable 
for 
them 
to 
think 
that 
the 
activity 
of 
their 
class
supplies 
the 
basis 
of 
the 
movement 
of 
all 
humanity, 
just<p>
as 
a 
similar
belief 
is 
natural 
and 
agreeable<p>
to 
traders, 
agriculturists, 
and 
soldiers
(if 
they 
do 
not 
express 
it, 
that 
is 
merely 
because 
traders 
and 
soldiers
do 
not 
write 
history), 
and 
(2) 
that 
spiritual 
activity, 
enlightenment,
civilization, 
culture, 
ideas, 
are 
all 
indistinct, 
indefinite 
conceptions
under 
whose 
banner 
it 
is 
very 
easy 
to 
use 
words 
having 
a 
still 
less
definite 
meaning, 
and 
which 
can 
therefore 
be 
readily 
introduced 
into<p>
any
theory.

But 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
the 
intrinsic 
quality 
of 
histories 
of 
this 
kind
(which 
may 
possibly 
even 
be 
of 
use 
to 
someone 
for 
something) 
the
histories 
of 
culture, 
to 
which 
all 
general 
histories 
tend 
more 
and 
more
to 
approximate, 
are 
significant 
from 
the 
fact 
that 
after 
seriously
and 
minutely 
examining 
various 
religious, 
philosophic, 
and<p>
political
doctrines 
as 
causes 
of 
events, 
as 
soon 
as 
they 
have 
to 
describe 
an
actual 
historic 
event 
such 
as<p>
the 
campaign 
of 
1812<p>
for 
instance, 
they
involuntarily 
describe 
it 
as 
resulting 
from 
an 
exercise 
of 
power-and 
say
plainly 
that 
that 
was 
the 
result 
of 
Napoleon's 
will.
