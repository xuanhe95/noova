Pavlovna 
had 
had 
a</h1>cough 
for 
some 
days. 
She 
was, 
as 
she 
said, 
suffering
from 
la 
grippe; 
grippe 
being 
then 
a 
new 
word 
in 
St. 
Petersburg, 
used
only 
by 
the 
<a href="/SL7sCi.html">elite.

All</a> 
her 
invitations 
without 
exception, 
written 
in 
French, 
and 
delivered
by 
a 
scarlet-liveried 
footman 
that 
morning, 
ran 
as 
follows:

"If 
you 
have 
nothing 
better 
to 
do, 
Count 
(or 
<a href="/xr6yf.html">Prince),</a> 
and 
if 
the
prospect 
of 
spending 
an 
evening 
with 
a 
poor 
invalid 
is 
not 
too 
terrible,
I 
shall 
be 
very 
charmed 
to 
see 
you 
tonight 
between 
7 
and 
10-Annette
Scherer."

"Heavens! 
what 
a 
virulent 
attack!" 
replied 
the 
prince, 
not 
in 
the
least 
disconcerted 
by 
this 
reception. 
He 
had 
just 
entered, 
wearing 
an
embroidered 
court 
uniform, 
knee 
breeches, 
and 
shoes, 
and 
had 
stars 
on
his 
breast 
and 
a 
serene 
expression 
on 
his 
flat 
face. 
He 
spoke 
in 
that
refined 
French 
in 
which 
our 
grandfathers 
not 
only 
spoke 
but 
<a href="/xr6yf.html">thought,</a> 
and
with 
the 
gentle, 
patronizing 
intonation 
natural 
to 
a 
man 
of 
importance
who 
had 
grown 
old 
in 
society 
and 
at 
court. 
He 
<a href="/LE4.html">went</a> 
up 
to 
Anna 
Pavlovna,
kissed 
her 
hand, 
presenting 
to 
her 
his 
bald, 
scented, 
and 
shining 
head,
and 
complacently 
seated 
himself 
on 
the 
sofa.

"First 
of 
all, 
dear 
friend, 
tell 
me 
how 
you 
are. 
Set 
your 
friend's
mind 
at 
rest," 
said 
he 
without 
altering 
his 
tone, 
beneath 
the
politeness 
and 
affected 
sympathy 
of 
which 
indifference 
and 
even 
irony
could 
be 
discerned.

"Can 
one 
be 
well 
while 
suffering 
morally? 
Can 
one 
be 
calm 
in 
times
like 
these 
if 
one 
has 
any 
feeling?" 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna. 
"You 
are
staying 
the 
whole 
evening, 
I 
hope?"

"And 
the 
fete 
at 
the 
English 
ambassador's? 
Today 
is 
Wednesday. 
I
must 
put 
in 
an 
appearance 
there," 
said 
the<p>
prince. 
"My 
daughter 
is
coming 
for 
me 
to 
take 
me 
there."

"I 
thought 
today's 
fete 
had 
been 
canceled. 
I 
confess 
all 
these
festivities 
and 
fireworks 
are 
becoming 
wearisome."

"If 
they 
had 
known 
that 
you 
wished 
it, 
the 
entertainment 
would 
have
been 
put 
off," 
said 
the 
prince,
