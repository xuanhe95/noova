He</a> 
sat 
down 
beside 
Hippolyte 
and 
wrinkling 
his 
forehead 
began 
talking
to 
him 
about 
politics. 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
the 
others 
gathered 
round 
these
two.

"The 
Berlin 
cabinet 
cannot 
express 
a 
feeling 
of 
alliance," 
began
Hippolyte 
gazing 
round 
with 
importance 
at 
the 
others, 
"without
expressing... 
as 
in 
its 
last 
note... 
you 
understand... 
Besides, 
unless
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
derogates 
from 
the 
principle 
of 
our 
alliance...

"Wait, 
I 
have 
not 
finished..." 
he 
said 
to 
Prince 
Andrew, 
seizing
him 
by 
the 
arm, 
"I 
believe 
that 
intervention 
will 
be 
stronger 
than
nonintervention. 
And..." 
he 
paused. 
"Finally 
one 
cannot 
impute 
the
nonreceipt 
of 
our 
dispatch 
of 
November 
18. 
That 
is 
how 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/lO53VWVhi4tjjJI.html">it</a> 
will 
end."
And 
he 
released 
Bolkonski's 
arm 
to 
indicate 
that 
he 
had 
now 
quite
finished.

"Demosthenes, 
I 
know 
thee 
by 
the 
pebble 
thou 
<a href="/cZl/qv22GLY3BAcC.html">secretest</a> 
in 
thy 
golden
mouth!" 
said 
Bilibin, 
and 
the 
mop 
of 
hair 
on 
his 
head 
moved 
with
satisfaction.

Everybody 
laughed, 
and 
Hippolyte 
louder 
than 
anyone. 
He 
was 
evidently
distressed, 
and 
breathed 
painfully, 
but 
could 
not 
restrain 
the 
wild
laughter 
that 
convulsed 
his 
usually 
impassive 
features.

"Well 
now, 
gentlemen," 
said 
Bilibin, 
"Bolkonski

my

"We

said 
one 
of
"ours,"

"In

said 
Bilibin.

replied 
Prince 
Andrew

at 
his 
watch.

"Where

"To 
the 
Emperor."

"Oh! 
Oh! 
Oh!"

"Well, 
au

Bolkonski! 
Au

Come 
back 
early 
to

cried 
several 
voices. 
"We'll 
take 
you 
in

"When

"I

but 
as

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/lm52SEu6jfdw.html">know</a>

replied 
Bolkonski, 
smiling.

"Well, 
talk

you 
can, 
anyway. 
He 
<a href="/cZl/aK7RPI6Nz2UKBi.html">has</a>

he

CHAPTER 
XII

At 
the 
levee 
Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
among 
the 
Austrian 
officers 
as 
he 
had
been 
told 
to, 
and 
the 
Emperor 
Francis 
merely 
looked 
fixedly 
into 
his
face 
and 
just 
nodded 
to 
him 
with 
his 
long 
head. 
But 
after 
it 
was
over, 
the 
adjutant 
he 
had 
seen 
the 
previous 
day 
ceremoniously 
informed
Bolkonski 
that 
the 
Emperor 
desired 
to 
give 
him 
an 
audience. 
The 
Emperor
Francis 
received 
him 
standing 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Qb7OfLLj2oFuln5tEu.html">room.</a> 
Before 
the
conversation 
began 
Prince 
Andrew 
was

night, 
and</h1>half 
the 
inhabitants 
had 
left 
the 
city
with 
Rostopchin's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mW4DduKC83.html">own</a> 
permission. 
Yet 
all 
the 
same 
this 
information
astonished 
and 
irritated 
the 
count, 
coming 
as 
it<p>
did 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a
simple 
note 
with 
an 
order 
from 
Kutuzov, 
and 
received 
at 
night, 
breaking
in 
on 
his 
beauty 
sleep.

When 
later 
on 
in 
his 
memoirs 
Count 
Rostopchin 
explained 
his 
actions 
at
this 
time, 
he 
repeatedly 
says 
that 
he 
was 
then 
actuated 
by 
two 
important
considerations: 
to 
maintain 
tranquillity 
in 
Moscow 
and 
expedite 
the
departure 
of 
the 
inhabitants.<p>
If 
one 
accepts 
this 
twofold 
aim 
all
Rostopchin's 
actions 
appear 
irreproachable. 
"Why 
were 
the 
holy 
relics,
the 
arms, 
ammunition, 
gunpowder, 
and 
stores 
of 
corn 
not 
removed? 
Why
were 
thousands 
of 
inhabitants 
deceived 
into 
believing 
that 
Moscow 
would
not 
be 
given 
up-and 
thereby 
ruined?" 
"To 
preserve 
the 
tranquillity
of 
the 
city," 
explains 
Count 
Rostopchin. 
"Why 
were 
bundles 
of 
useless
papers 
from 
the 
government 
offices, 
and 
Leppich's 
balloon 
and 
other
articles 
removed?" 
"To 
leave 
the 
town 
empty," 
explains 
Count 
Rostopchin.
One 
need 
only 
admit 
that 
public 
tranquillity 
is 
in 
danger 
and 
any 
action
finds 
a 
justification.

All 
the 
horrors 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
terror 
were 
based 
only 
on 
solicitude 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oh2to5lFuWA.html">for
public</a> 
tranquillity.

On 
what, 
then, 
was 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
fear 
for 
the 
tranquillity<p>
of
Moscow 
based 
in 
1812? 
What 
reason 
was 
there 
for 
assuming 
any 
probability
of 
an 
uprising 
in 
the 
city? 
The 
inhabitants 
were 
leaving 
it 
and 
the
retreating 
troops 
were 
filling 
it. 
Why 
should 
that 
cause 
the 
masses 
to
riot?

Neither 
in 
Moscow 
nor 
anywhere 
in 
Russia 
did 
anything 
resembling 
an
insurrection 
ever 
occur 
when<p>
the 
enemy 
entered 
a 
town. 
More 
than
ten 
thousand 
people 
were 
still 
in 
Moscow 
on 
the 
first 
and 
second 
of
September, 
and 
except 
for 
a 
mob 
in 
the 
governor's 
courtyard, 
assembled
there 
at 
his 
bidding, 
nothing 
happened.<p>
It<p>
is 
obvious 
that 
there 
would
have 
been 
even 
less 
reason 
to 
expect 
a 
disturbance 
among 
the 
people
if 
after 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino, 
when 
the 
surrender 
of 
Moscow 
became
certain 
or 
at 
least 
probable, 
Rostopchin 
instead 
of 
exciting 
the 
people
by 
distributing 
arms 
and 
broadsheets 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
remove 
all
the 
holy 
relics, 
the 
gunpowder, 
munitions, 
and 
money, 
and 
had 
told 
the
population 
plainly 
that 
the 
town 
would 
be 
abandoned.

Rostopchin, 
though 
he 
had 
patriotic 
sentiments,<p>
was 
a 
sanguine 
and
impulsive 
man 
who 
had 
always 
moved 
in 
the 
highest 
administrative 
circles
and 
had 
no 
understanding 
at 
all 
of 
the<p>
people 
he 
supposed 
himself 
to
be 
guiding. 
Ever 
since 
the 
enemy's<p>
entry 
into 
Smolensk 
he 
had 
in
imagination 
been 
playing 
the 
role<p>
of 
director 
of 
the 
popular 
feeling
of 
"the 
heart 
of 
Russia." 
Not 
only 
did 
it 
seem 
to 
him 
(as 
to 
all
administrators) 
that 
he 
controlled 
the 
external 
actions 
of 
Moscow's
inhabitants, 
but 
he 
also 
thought 
he 
controlled 
their 
mental 
attitude 
by
means 
of 
his 
broadsheets 
and 
posters, 
written 
in 
a 
coarse 
tone 
which 
the
people 
despise 
in 
their 
own 
class 
and 
do 
not 
understand<p>
from 
those 
in
authority. 
Rostopchin 
was 
so 
pleased 
with 
the 
fine 
role 
of 
leader

Suddenly 
Pierre 
heaved 
a 
deep 
sigh 
and 
dumped 
his 
heavy 
person 
down 
on
the 
sofa 
beside 
Prince 
Andrew.

"With 
Natasha 
Rostova,

said

"Yes, 
yes! 
Who 
else 
should 
it 
be? 
I 
should 
never 
have 
believed 
it,
but 
the 
feeling 
is 
stronger 
than 
I. 
Yesterday 
I 
tormented

I 
would 
not

even 
that 
torment 
for 
anything

But 
can

Why
don't 
you 
speak?"

"I? 
I? 
What 
did 
I 
tell 
you?" 
said 
Pierre 
suddenly, 
rising 
and
beginning 
to 
pace 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room. 
"I 
always 
thought 
it.... 
That
girl 
is 
such 
a 
treasure... 
she 
is 
a 
rare 
girl.... 
My 
dear

I 
entreat 
you, 
don't 
philosophize, 
don't 
doubt, 
marry, 
marry,
marry.... 
And 
I 
am 
sure 
there 
will 
not 
be 
a 
happier 
man 
than 
you."

"But 
what 
of 
her?"

"She 
loves 
you."

"Don't 
talk 
rubbish..." 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
smiling 
and 
looking
into 
Pierre's 
eyes.

"She 
does, 
I 
know," 
Pierre 
cried 
fiercely.

"But 
do 
listen," 
returned 
Prince 
Andrew, 
holding 
him 
by 
the
arm. 
"Do 
you 
know 
the 
condition 
I 
am 
in? 
I 
must 
talk 
about 
it 
to
someone."

"Well, 
go 
on, 
go 
on. 
I 
am 
very 
glad," 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
his 
face
really 
changed, 
his 
brow 
became 
smooth, 
and 
he 
listened 
gladly 
to 
Prince
Andrew. 
Prince 
Andrew 
seemed, 
and 
really 
was, 
quite 
a 
different, 
quite
a 
new 
man. 
Where 
was 
his 
spleen, 
his 
contempt 
for 
life, 
his
disillusionment? 
Pierre 
was 
the 
only 
person 
to 
whom 
he 
made 
up 
his 
mind
to 
speak 
openly; 
and 
to 
him 
he 
told 
all 
that 
was 
in 
his 
soul. 
Now 
he
boldly 
and 
lightly 
made 
plans 
for 
an 
extended 
future, 
said 
he 
could 
not
sacrifice 
his 
own 
happiness 
to 
his 
father's 
caprice,<p>
and 
spoke 
of 
how
he 
would 
either 
make 
his<p>
father 
consent 
to 
this 
marriage 
and 
love 
her,
or 
would 
do 
without 
his 
consent; 
then 
he 
marveled 
at 
the 
feeling 
that
had 
mastered 
him 
as 
at 
something 
strange, 
apart 
from 
and 
independent 
of
himself.

"I 
should 
not 
have 
believed 
anyone 
who 
told 
me 
that 
I 
was 
capable 
of
such 
love," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

muslin 
with 
pink
ribbons.

Natasha 
fell 
in 
love 
the 
very 
moment 
she 
entered 
the 
ballroom. 
She
was 
not 
in 
love 
with 
anyone 
in 
particular, 
but 
with 
everyone. 
Whatever
person 
she 
happened 
to 
look 
at 
she 
was 
in 
love 
with 
for 
that 
moment.

"Oh, 
how 
delightful 
it 
is!" 
she 
kept 
saying, 
running 
up 
to 
Sonya.

Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
were 
walking 
up 
and 
down, 
looking 
with 
kindly
patronage 
<a href="/cZl/uI3zT3Dj7dS.html">at</a> 
the 
dancers.

"How 
sweet 
she 
is-she 
will 
be 
a 
weal 
beauty!" 
said 
Denisov.

"Who?"

"Countess 
Natasha," 
answered 
Denisov.

"And 
how 
she 
dances! 
What 
gwace!" 
he 
said 
again 
after 
a 
pause.

"Who 
are 
you 
talking 
about?"

"About 
your 
sister," 
ejaculated 
Denisov 
testily.

Rostov 
smiled.

"My 
dear 
count, 
you 
were 
one 
of 
my 
best 
pupils-you 
must 
dance,"
said 
little 
Iogel 
coming 
up 
to 
Nicholas. 
"Look 
how 
many 
charming 
young
ladies-" 
He 
turned 
with 
the 
same 
request 
to 
Denisov 
who 
was 
also 
a
former 
pupil 
of 
<a href="/cZl/JE1KDz1HI.html">his.

"No,</a> 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
I'll 
be 
a 
wallflower," 
said 
Denisov.
"Don't 
you 
wecollect 
what 
bad 
use 
I<p>
made 
of 
your 
lessons?"

"Oh 
no!" 
said 
Iogel, 
hastening 
to 
reassure 
him. 
"You 
were 
only
inattentive, 
but 
you 
had 
talent-oh 
yes, 
you 
had 
talent!"

The 
band 
struck 
up 
the 
newly 
introduced 
mazurka. 
Nicholas 
could 
not
refuse 
Iogel 
and 
asked 
Sonya 
to 
dance. 
Denisov 
sat 
down 
by 
the 
old
ladies 
and, 
leaning 
on 
his 
saber 
and 
beating<p>
time 
with 
his 
foot, 
told
them 
something 
funny 
and 
kept 
them 
amused,

CHAPTER 
XVIII

For 
the 
last 
two 
days, 
ever 
since 
leaving 
home, 
Pierre 
had 
been 
living
in 
the 
empty 
house 
of 
his 
deceased 
benefactor, 
Bazdeev. 
This 
is 
how 
it
happened.

When 
he 
woke 
up 
on 
the 
morning 
after 
his 
return 
to 
Moscow 
and 
his
interview 
with 
Count 
Rostopchin, 
he 
could 
not 
for 
some 
time 
make 
out
where 
he 
was 
and 
what 
was 
expected 
of 
him. 
When 
he 
was 
informed 
that
among 
others 
awaiting 
him 
in 
his 
reception 
room 
<a href="/aVzUge/suD4UHdX4suDcq6GBhrH.html">there</a> 
was 
a 
Frenchman
who 
had 
brought 
a 
letter 
from 
his 
wife, 
the 
Countess 
Helene, 
he 
felt
suddenly 
overcome 
by 
that 
sense 
of 
confusion 
and 
hopelessness 
to 
which
he 
was 
apt 
to 
succumb. 
He 
felt 
that 
everything 
was 
now 
at 
an 
end, 
all
was 
in 
confusion 
and 
crumbling 
to 
pieces, 
that 
nobody 
was 
right 
or
wrong, 
the 
future 
held 
nothing, 
and 
there 
was 
no 
escape 
from 
this
position. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">Smiling</a> 
unnaturally 
and 
muttering 
to 
himself, 
he 
first 
sat
down 
on 
the 
sofa 
in 
an 
attitude 
of 
despair, 
then 
rose, 
went 
to 
the 
door
of 
the 
reception 
room 
and 
peeped 
through 
the 
crack, 
returned 
flourishing
his 
arms, 
and 
took 
up 
a 
book. 
His 
major-domo 
came 
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mS2fY5hQrxS8OgAj.html">a</a> 
second 
time 
to
say 
that 
the 
Frenchman 
who 
had 
brought 
the 
letter 
from 
the 
countess
was 
very 
anxious 
to 
see 
him 
if 
only 
for 
a 
minute, 
and 
that 
someone 
from
Bazdeev's 
widow 
had 
called 
to 
ask 
Pierre 
to 
take<p>
charge 
of 
her 
husband's
books, 
as 
she 
herself 
was 
leaving 
for 
the 
country.

"Oh, 
yes, 
in 
a 
minute; 
wait... 
or 
no! 
No, 
of 
course... 
go 
and 
say 
I 
will
come 
directly," 
Pierre 
replied 
to 
the 
major-domo.

But 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
man 
had 
left 
the 
room 
Pierre 
took 
up 
his 
hat 
which
was 
lying 
on 
the 
table 
and 
went 
out 
of 
his 
study 
by 
the 
other 
door.
There 
was 
no 
one 
in 
the 
passage. 
He 
went 
along 
the 
whole 
length 
of 
this
passage 
to 
the 
stairs 
and, 
frowning 
and 
rubbing 
his 
forehead 
with
both 
hands, 
went 
down 
as 
far 
as 
the 
first 
landing. 
The 
hall 
porter 
was
standing 
at 
the 
front 
door. 
From 
the 
landing 
where 
Pierre 
stood<p>
there
was 
a 
second 
staircase 
leading 
to 
the 
back 
entrance. 
He 
went 
down 
that
staircase 
and 
out 
into 
the 
yard. 
No 
one 
had 
seen 
him. 
But 
there 
were
some 
carriages 
waiting, 
and 
as 
soon 
as 
Pierre 
stepped<p>
out 
of 
the 
gate

coachmen

CHAPTER 
XV

On 
receiving 
command 
of 
the 
armies 
Kutuzov 
remembered 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
sent 
an 
order 
for 
him 
to 
report 
at 
headquarters.

Prince 
Andrew 
arrived 
at 
Tsarevo-Zaymishche 
on 
the 
very 
day 
and 
at 
the
very 
hour 
that 
Kutuzov 
was 
reviewing 
the 
troops 
for 
the 
first 
time. 
He
stopped 
in 
the 
village 
at 
the 
priest's 
house 
in 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">front</a> 
of 
which 
stood 
the
commander 
in 
chief's 
carriage, 
and 
he 
sat 
down 
on 
the 
bench 
at 
the 
gate
awaiting 
his 
Serene 
Highness, 
as 
everyone 
now 
called 
Kutuzov. 
From 
the
field 
beyond 
the 
village 
came 
now 
sounds 
of 
regimental 
music 
<a href="/aVzUge/mK9b97YIp.html">and</a> 
now 
the
roar 
of 
many 
voices 
shouting 
"Hurrah!" 
to 
the 
new 
commander 
in 
chief.
Two 
orderlies, 
a 
courier 
and 
a 
major-domo, 
stood 
near 
by, 
some 
ten 
paces
from 
Prince 
Andrew, 
availing 
themselves 
of 
Kutuzov's 
absence 
and 
of 
the
fine 
weather. 
A 
short, 
swarthy 
lieutenant 
colonel 
of 
hussars 
with 
thick
mustaches 
and 
whiskers 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
gate 
and, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ne8NSUp0bmpaY5.html">glancing</a> 
at 
Prince
Andrew, 
inquired 
whether 
his 
Serene 
Highness 
was 
putting 
up 
there 
and
whether 
he 
would 
soon 
be 
back.

Prince 
Andrew 
replied 
that 
he 
was 
not 
on 
his 
Serene 
Highness' 
staff
but 
was 
himself 
a 
new<p>
arrival. 
The 
lieutenant 
colonel 
turned 
to 
a 
smart
orderly, 
who, 
with 
the 
peculiar 
contempt 
with 
which 
a 
commander<p>
in
chief's 
orderly 
speaks 
to 
officers, 
replied:

"What? 
His 
Serene 
Highness? 
I 
expect 
he'll 
be 
here 
soon. 
What 
do 
you
want?"

The 
lieutenant 
colonel 
of 
hussars 
smiled 
beneath 
his 
mustache 
at 
the
orderly's 
tone, 
dismounted, 
gave 
his 
horse 
to 
a 
dispatch 
runner, 
and
approached 
Bolkonski 
with 
a 
slight 
bow. 
Bolkonski 
made 
room 
for 
him 
on
the 
bench 
and 
the 
lieutenant 
colonel 
sat 
down 
beside 
him.

"You're 
also 
waiting 
for 
the 
commander 
in 
chief?" 
said 
he. 
"They

Did 
you

he 
asked.

"I 
had 
the 
pleasure," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"not 
only 
of 
taking 
part 
in
the 
retreat

Denisov,
pressing 
Prince 
Andrew's 
hand 
and 
looking 
into 
his 
face 
with 
a
particularly 
kindly 
attention. 
"Yes,

said 
he 
sympathetically,
and 
after 
a

added:

back."

The<p>
squadron 
crossed 
the 
bridge 
and 
drew 
out 
of 
range<p>
of 
fire 
without
having 
lost 
a 
single 
man. 
The 
second 
squadron 
that 
had 
been 
in 
the 
front
line 
followed 
them 
across 
and 
the 
last 
Cossacks 
quitted 
the 
farther 
side
of 
the 
river.

The 
two 
Pavlograd 
squadrons, 
having 
crossed 
the 
bridge, 
retired 
up 
the
hill 
one 
after 
the 
other. 
Their 
colonel, 
Karl 
Bogdanich 
Schubert, 
came
up 
to 
Denisov's 
squadron 
and 
rode 
at 
a 
footpace 
not 
far 
from 
Rostov,
without 
taking 
any 
notice 
of 
him 
although 
they 
were 
now 
meeting 
for 
the
first 
time 
since 
their 
encounter 
concerning 
Telyanin. 
Rostov, 
feeling
that 
he 
was 
at 
the 
front 
and 
in 
the 
power 
of 
a 
man 
toward 
whom 
he 
now
admitted 
that 
he 
had 
been 
to 
blame, 
did 
not 
lift 
his 
eyes 
from 
the
colonel's 
athletic 
back, 
his 
nape 
covered 
with 
light 
hair, 
and 
his 
red
neck. 
It 
seemed 
to 
Rostov 
that 
Bogdanich 
was 
only 
pretending 
not
to 
notice 
him, 
and 
that 
his 
whole 
aim 
now 
was 
to 
test 
the 
cadet's
courage, 
so 
he 
drew 
himself 
up 
and 
looked 
around 
him 
merrily; 
then 
it
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
Bogdanich 
rode 
so 
near 
in 
order 
to 
show 
him<p>
his
courage. 
Next 
he 
thought 
that 
his 
enemy 
would 
send 
the 
squadron 
on 
a
desperate 
attack 
just 
to 
punish 
him-Rostov. 
Then 
he 
imagined 
how,
after 
the 
attack, 
Bogdanich 
would 
come 
up 
to 
him 
as 
he 
lay 
wounded 
and
would 
magnanimously 
extend 
the 
hand 
of 
reconciliation.

The 
high-shouldered 
figure 
of 
Zherkov, 
familiar 
to 
the 
Pavlograds 
as
he 
had 
but 
recently 
left 
their 
regiment, 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
colonel.
After 
his 
dismissal 
from 
headquarters 
Zherkov 
had 
not 
remained 
in 
the
regiment, 
saying 
he 
was 
not 
such 
a 
fool 
as 
to 
slave 
at 
the 
front 
when 
he
could 
get 
more 
rewards 
by 
doing 
nothing 
on 
the 
staff, 
and 
had 
succeeded
in 
attaching 
himself 
as 
an 
orderly 
officer 
to 
Prince 
Bagration. 
He 
now
came 
to 
his 
former 
chief<p>
with 
an 
order 
from 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
rear
guard.

"Colonel,"<p>
he 
said, 
addressing 
Rostov's 
enemy 
with 
an 
air 
of
gloomy 
gravity 
and 
glancing 
round 
at 
his 
comrades, 
"there 
is 
an 
order
to 
stop 
and 
fire 
the 
bridge."

"An 
order 
to 
who?" 
asked 
the 
colonel 
morosely.

"I 
don't 
myself 
know 
'to 
who,'" 
replied 
the 
cornet 
in 
a
serious 
tone, 
"but 
the 
prince 
told 
me 
to 
'go 
and 
tell 
the 
colonel
that 
the 
hussars 
must 
return 
quickly 
and 
fire 
the 
bridge.'"

Zherkov 
was 
followed 
by 
an 
officer 
of 
the 
suite 
who 
rode 
up 
to 
the
colonel 
of 
hussars 
with 
the 
same 
order. 
After 
him 
the 
stout 
Nesvitski
came 
galloping 
up 
on 
a 
Cossack 
horse 
that 
could 
scarcely 
carry 
his
weight.

"How's 
this, 
Colonel?" 
he 
shouted 
as 
he 
approached. 
"I 
told 
you
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
and 
now 
someone 
has 
gone 
and 
blundered; 
they 
are 
all
beside 
themselves 
over 
there 
and 
one 
can't 
make 
anything 
out."

The 
colonel 
deliberately 
stopped 
the 
regiment 
and 
turned 
to 
Nesvitski.

"You 
spoke 
to 
me 
of 
inflammable 
material," 
said 
he, 
"but 
you 
said
nothing 
about 
firing 
it."

"But, 
my 
dear 
sir," 
said 
Nesvitski 
as 
he 
drew 
up, 
taking 
off 
his
cap 
and 
smoothing 
his 
hair 
wet 
with 
perspiration 
with 
his 
plump 
hand,

In 
answer
to 
Toll, 
Paulucci 
suggested 
an 
advance 
and 
an 
attack, 
which, 
he 
urged,
could 
alone 
extricate 
us 
from 
the 
present 
uncertainty 
and 
from 
the 
trap
(as 
he 
called 
the 
Drissa<p>
camp) 
in 
which 
we 
were 
situated.

During 
all 
these 
discussions 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
interpreter, 
Wolzogen
(his 
"bridge" 
in 
court 
relations), 
were 
silent. 
Pfuel 
only<p>
snorted
contemptuously 
and 
turned 
away, 
to 
show 
that 
he 
would 
never 
demean
himself 
by 
replying 
to 
such 
nonsense 
as 
he 
was 
now 
hearing. 
So 
when
Prince 
Volkonski, 
who 
was 
in 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/fU9i8v2i.html">chair,</a> 
called 
on 
him 
to 
give 
his
opinion, 
he 
merely 
said:

"Why 
ask 
me? 
General 
Armfeldt 
has 
proposed 
a 
splendid

with 
an
exposed 
rear,

not 
this 
Italian

Why 
ask

said 
he. 
"Why, 
you

up
entirely-that

with 
her 
whole 
soul, 
leaving 
no 
corner 
of 
it 
hidden
from 
him. 
She 
felt 
that 
her 
unity 
with 
her

was 
not 
maintained
by 
the 
poetic 
feelings 
that 
had 
attracted 
him

by 
something
else-indefinite 
but 
firm 
as 
the 
bond 
between 
her

out 
her

as 
to

To 
adorn 
herself

might 
perhaps
have 
been 
agreeable-she 
did 
not 
know-but 
she 
had 
no 
time 
at 
all 
for 
it.
The 
chief 
reason 
for 
devoting 
no 
time 
either 
to 
singing, 
to 
dress, 
or
to 
choosing 
her 
words 
was 
that 
she 
really 
had 
no 
time 
to 
spare 
for 
these
things.

We 
know 
that 
man 
has 
the 
faculty 
of 
becoming 
completely 
absorbed 
in
a 
subject 
however 
trivial 
it 
may 
be, 
and 
that 
there 
is 
no 
subject 
so
trivial 
that 
it 
will 
not 
grow 
to 
infinite 
proportions 
if 
one's 
entire
attention 
is 
devoted 
to 
it.

The 
subject 
which 
wholly 
engrossed 
Natasha's 
attention 
was 
her 
family:
that 
is, 
her 
husband 
whom 
she 
had 
to 
keep 
so 
that 
he 
should 
belong
entirely 
to 
her 
and 
to 
the 
home, 
and 
the 
children 
whom 
she 
had 
to 
bear,
bring 
into 
the 
world, 
nurse, 
and 
bring 
up.

And 
the 
deeper 
she 
penetrated, 
not 
with 
her 
mind 
only 
but 
with 
her 
whole
soul, 
her 
whole 
being, 
into 
the 
subject 
that 
absorbed 
her, 
the 
larger
did 
that 
subject 
grow 
and 
the 
weaker 
and 
more 
inadequate 
did 
her 
powers
appear, 
so 
that 
she 
concentrated 
them 
wholly 
on 
that 
one 
thing 
and 
yet
was 
unable 
to 
accomplish 
all 
that 
she 
considered 
necessary.

There<p>
were 
then 
as 
now 
conversations 
and 
discussions 
about 
women's
rights, 
the 
relations 
of 
husband 
and 
wife 
and 
their 
freedom 
and 
rights,
though 
these 
themes 
were 
not 
yet 
termed 
questions 
as 
they 
are 
now; 
but
these 
topics 
were 
not 
merely 
uninteresting 
to 
Natasha, 
she 
positively
did 
not 
understand 
them.

These 
questions, 
then 
as 
now, 
existed 
only 
for 
those 
who 
see 
nothing 
in
marriage 
but 
the 
pleasure 
married 
people 
get 
from 
one 
another, 
that 
is,
only 
the 
beginnings 
of 
marriage 
and 
not 
its 
whole 
significance, 
which
lies 
in 
the 
family.

Discussions 
and 
questions

that 
kind,

the

how

it

engrossed 
by 
watching 
the

Now, 
seated 
on

the

he
observed 
the

him.

By 
ten

some 
twenty

Natasha.

"Sonya, 
what 
is 
this?" 
she 
cried, 
twanging 
a 
thick 
string.

"Oh, 
you 
are 
there!" 
said 
Sonya 
with 
a 
start, 
and 
came 
near 
and
listened. 
"I 
don't 
know. 
A 
storm?" 
she 
ventured 
timidly, 
afraid 
of
being 
wrong.

"There! 
That's 
just 
how 
she 
started 
and 
just 
how 
she 
came 
up 
smiling
timidly 
when 
all 
this 
happened 
before," 
thought 
Natasha, 
"and 
in
just 
the 
same 
way 
I 
thought 
there 
was 
something 
lacking 
in 
her."

"No, 
it's 
the 
chorus 
from 
The 
Water-Carrier, 
listen!" 
and 
Natasha
sang 
the 
air 
of 
the 
chorus 
so 
that 
Sonya 
should<p>
catch 
it. 
"Where 
were
you<p>
going?" 
she 
asked.

"To 
change 
the 
water 
in 
this 
glass. 
I 
am 
just 
finishing 
the 
design."

"You 
always 
find 
something 
to 
do, 
but 
I 
can't," 
said 
Natasha.
"And 
where's 
Nicholas?"

"Asleep, 
I 
think."

"Sonya, 
go 
and 
wake 
him," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Tell 
him 
I 
want 
him 
to
come 
and 
sing."

She 
sat 
awhile, 
wondering 
what 
the 
meaning 
of 
it 
all 
having 
happened
before 
could 
be, 
and 
without 
solving 
this 
problem, 
or 
at 
all 
regretting
not 
having 
done 
so, 
she 
again 
passed 
in 
fancy 
to 
the 
time 
when 
she 
was
with 
him 
and 
he 
was 
looking 
at 
her 
with 
a 
lover's 
eyes.

"Oh, 
if 
only 
he 
would 
come 
quicker! 
I 
am 
so<p>
afraid 
it 
will 
never 
be!
And, 
worst 
of 
all, 
I 
am 
growing 
old-that's 
the 
thing! 
There 
won't
then 
be 
in 
me 
what 
there 
is 
now. 
But 
perhaps 
he'll 
come 
today, 
will
come 
immediately. 
Perhaps 
he 
has 
come 
and 
is 
sitting 
in 
the 
drawing
room. 
Perhaps 
he 
came 
yesterday 
and 
I 
have 
forgotten 
it." 
She 
rose,
put 
down 
the 
guitar, 
and 
went 
to 
the 
drawing 
room.

All 
the 
domestic 
circle, 
tutors, 
governesses, 
and 
guests, 
were 
already
at 
the 
tea 
table. 
The 
servants 
stood 
round 
the 
table-but 
Prince 
Andrew
was 
not 
there 
and 
life 
was 
going 
on 
as 
before.

"Ah, 
here 
she 
is!" 
said 
the 
old 
count, 
when 
he 
saw 
Natasha 
enter.
"Well, 
sit 
down 
by 
me." 
But 
Natasha 
stayed 
by 
her 
mother 
and
glanced 
round 
as 
if 
looking 
for 
something.

"Mamma!" 
she 
muttered, 
"give 
him 
to 
me, 
give 
him, 
Mamma, 
quickly,
quickly!" 
and 
she 
again 
had 
difficulty 
in 
repressing 
her 
sobs.

She 
sat 
down 
at 
the 
table 
and 
listened 
to 
the 
conversation 
between 
the
elders 
and 
Nicholas, 
who 
had 
also 
come 
to 
the 
table. 
"My 
God, 
my 
God!
The 
same 
faces, 
the 
same 
talk, 
Papa 
holding 
his 
cup 
and 
blowing 
in 
the
same 
way!" 
thought 
Natasha, 
feeling 
with 
horror 
a 
sense 
of 
repulsion
rising 
up 
in 
her 
for 
the 
whole 
household, 
because 
they 
were 
always 
the
same.

After 
tea, 
Nicholas, 
Sonya, 
and 
Natasha 
went 
to 
the 
sitting 
room, 
to

favorite 
corner

saw</h1>how 
the 
Emperor's 
rather
round 
shoulders 
shuddered 
as 
if 
a 
cold 
shiver 
had 
run 
down 
them, 
how 
his
left 
foot 
began 
convulsively 
tapping 
the 
horse's 
side 
with 
the 
spur,
and 
how 
the 
well-trained 
horse 
looked 
round 
unconcerned 
and 
did 
not
stir. 
An 
adjutant, 
dismounting, 
lifted 
the 
soldier 
under 
the 
arms 
to
place 
him 
on 
a 
stretcher 
that 
had<p>
been 
brought. 
The 
soldier 
groaned.

"Gently, 
gently! 
Can't 
you 
do 
it 
more 
gently?" 
said 
the 
Emperor
apparently 
suffering 
more 
than 
the 
dying 
soldier, 
and 
he 
rode 
away.

Rostov 
saw 
tears 
filling 
the 
Emperor's 
eyes 
and 
heard 
him, 
as 
he 
was
riding 
away, 
say 
to 
Czartoryski: 
"What 
a 
terrible 
thing 
war 
is: 
what
a 
terrible 
thing! 
Quelle 
terrible 
chose 
que 
la 
guerre!"

The<p>
troops 
of<p>
the 
vanguard 
were 
stationed 
before 
Wischau, 
within 
sight
of 
the 
enemy's 
lines, 
which 
all 
day 
long 
had 
yielded 
ground 
to 
us
at 
the 
least 
firing. 
The 
Emperor's 
gratitude 
was 
announced 
to 
the
vanguard, 
rewards 
were 
promised, 
and 
the 
men 
received 
a 
double 
ration 
of
vodka. 
The 
campfires 
crackled 
and 
the 
soldiers' 
songs 
resounded
even 
more 
merrily 
than 
on 
the 
previous 
night. 
Denisov 
celebrated 
his
promotion 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
major, 
and 
Rostov, 
who 
had 
already 
drunk
enough, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
feast 
proposed 
the 
Emperor's 
health. 
"Not
'our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor,' 
as 
they 
say 
at 
official 
dinners,"
said 
he, 
"but 
the 
health 
of 
our 
Sovereign, 
that 
good, 
enchanting, 
and
great 
man! 
Let 
us 
drink 
to 
his 
health 
and 
to 
the 
certain 
defeat 
of 
the
French!"

"If 
we 
fought 
before," 
he 
said, 
"not 
letting 
the 
French 
pass, 
as
at 
Schoen 
Grabern, 
what 
shall 
we 
not 
do 
now 
when 
he 
is 
at 
the 
front? 
We
will 
all 
die 
for 
him 
gladly! 
Is 
it 
not 
so, 
gentlemen? 
Perhaps 
I 
am 
not
saying 
it 
right, 
I 
have 
drunk 
a 
good 
deal-but 
that 
is 
how 
I 
feel, 
and
so 
do 
you 
too! 
To 
the 
health 
of<p>
Alexander 
the 
First! 
Hurrah!"

"Hurrah!" 
rang 
the 
enthusiastic 
voices 
of 
the 
officers.

And 
the 
old 
cavalry 
captain, 
Kirsten, 
shouted 
enthusiastically 
and 
no
less<p>
sincerely 
than 
the 
twenty-year-old 
Rostov.

When 
the 
officers 
had 
emptied 
and 
smashed 
their 
glasses, 
Kirsten 
filled
others 
and, 
in 
shirt 
sleeves 
and 
breeches, 
went 
glass 
in 
hand 
to 
the
soldiers' 
bonfires 
and 
with 
his 
long 
gray 
mustache, 
his 
white 
chest
showing 
under 
his 
open 
shirt, 
he 
stood 
in 
a 
majestic 
pose 
in 
the 
light
of 
the 
campfire, 
waving 
his 
uplifted 
arm.

"Lads! 
here's 
to 
our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
victory 
over
our 
enemies! 
Hurrah!" 
he 
exclaimed 
in 
his 
dashing, 
old, 
hussar's
baritone.

The 
hussars 
crowded 
round 
and 
responded 
heartily 
with 
loud 
shouts.

Late 
that 
night, 
when 
all 
had 
separated, 
Denisov 
with 
his 
short 
hand
patted 
his 
favorite, 
Rostov, 
on 
the 
shoulder.

"As 
there's 
no 
one 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
on 
campaign, 
he's 
fallen
in 
love 
with 
the 
Tsar," 
he 
said.

"Denisov, 
don't 
make 
fun 
of 
it!" 
cried 
Rostov. 
"It 
is 
such 
a
lofty, 
beautiful 
feeling, 
such 
a..."

"I 
believe 
it, 
I 
believe 
it, 
fwiend, 
and 
I 
share 
and 
appwove..."

"No, 
you 
don't 
understand!"

And 
Rostov 
got 
up 
and 
went 
wandering 
among 
the 
campfires, 
dreaming 
of
what 
happiness 
it 
would 
be 
to 
die-not 
in 
saving 
the 
Emperor's 
life
(he 
did 
not 
even 
dare 
to 
dream 
of 
that), 
but 
simply 
to 
die 
before 
his
eyes. 
He

and

up

and
at 
the 
head 
of 
them 
Rostov 
recognized 
Napoleon. 
It 
could 
be 
no<p>
one
else. 
He 
came 
at 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">gallop,</a> 
wearing 
a 
small 
hat, 
a 
blue 
uniform 
open 
over
a 
white 
vest, 
and 
the 
St. 
Andrew 
ribbon 
over 
his 
shoulder. 
He 
was 
riding
a 
very 
fine 
thoroughbred<p>
gray 
Arab 
horse 
with 
a 
crimson 
gold-embroidered
saddlecloth. 
On 
approaching 
Alexander 
he 
raised 
his 
hat, 
and 
as 
he 
did
so, 
Rostov, 
with 
his 
cavalryman's 
eye, 
could 
not 
help 
noticing
that 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
sit 
well 
or 
firmly 
in 
the 
saddle. 
The 
battalions
shouted 
"Hurrah!" 
and 
"Vive 
l'Empereur!" 
Napoleon 
said
something 
to 
Alexander, 
and 
both 
Emperors 
dismounted 
and 
took 
each
other's 
hands. 
Napoleon's 
face 
wore 
an 
unpleasant 
and 
artificial
smile. 
Alexander 
was 
saying 
something 
affable 
to 
him.

In 
spite 
of 
the 
trampling 
of 
the 
French 
gendarmes' 
horses, 
which
were 
pushing 
back 
the 
crowd, 
Rostov 
kept 
his 
eyes 
on 
every 
movement
of 
Alexander 
and 
Bonaparte. 
It 
struck 
him 
as 
a 
surprise 
that 
Alexander
treated 
Bonaparte 
as 
an 
equal 
and 
that 
the 
latter 
was 
quite 
at 
ease 
with
the 
Tsar, 
as 
if 
such 
relations 
with 
an 
Emperor 
were 
an 
everyday 
matter
to 
him.

Alexander 
and 
Napoleon, 
with 
the 
long 
train 
of 
their 
suites, 
approached
the 
right 
flank 
of 
the 
Preobrazhensk 
battalion 
and 
came 
straight 
up 
to
the 
crowd 
standing 
there. 
The 
crowd 
unexpectedly 
found 
itself 
so 
close
to 
the 
Emperors 
that 
Rostov, 
standing 
in 
the 
front<p>
row, 
was 
afraid 
he
might 
be 
recognized.

"Sire, 
I 
ask 
your 
permission 
to 
present 
the 
Legion 
of 
Honor 
to 
the
bravest 
of 
your 
soldiers," 
said 
a 
sharp, 
precise 
voice, 
articulating
every 
letter.

This 
was 
said 
by 
the 
undersized 
Napoleon, 
looking 
up 
straight 
into
Alexander's 
eyes. 
Alexander 
listened 
attentively 
to 
what 
was 
said 
to
him 
and, 
bending 
his 
head, 
smiled 
pleasantly.

"To 
him 
who 
has 
borne 
himself 
most 
bravely 
in 
this 
last 
war," 
added
Napoleon, 
accentuating 
each 
syllable, 
as 
with 
a 
composure 
and 
assurance
exasperating 
to 
Rostov, 
he 
ran 
his 
eyes 
over 
the 
Russian 
ranks 
drawn
up 
before 
him, 
who 
all 
presented 
arms 
with 
their 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
their
Emperor.

"Will 
Your 
Majesty 
allow 
me 
to 
consult 
the 
colonel?" 
said 
Alexander
and 
took 
a 
few 
hasty 
steps 
toward 
Prince 
Kozlovski, 
the 
commander 
of
the 
battalion.

Bonaparte 
meanwhile 
began 
taking 
the 
glove 
off 
his 
small 
white 
hand,
tore 
it 
in 
doing 
so, 
and 
threw 
it 
away. 
An 
aide-de-camp 
behind 
him
rushed 
forward 
and 
picked 
it 
up.

"To 
whom 
shall 
it 
be 
given?" 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
asked 
Kozlovski,
in 
Russian 
in 
a 
low 
voice.

"To 
whomever 
Your 
Majesty 
commands."

The 
Emperor 
knit 
his 
brows 
with 
dissatisfaction 
and, 
glancing 
back,
remarked:

"But 
we 
must 
give 
him 
an 
answer."

Kozlovski 
scanned 
the 
ranks 
resolutely 
and 
included 
Rostov 
in 
his
scrutiny.

"Can 
it 
be 
me?" 
thought 
Rostov.

"Lazarev!" 
the 
colonel 
called, 
with 
a 
frown, 
and 
Lazarev, 
the
first 
soldier 
in<p>
the 
rank, 
stepped 
briskly 
forward.

"Where 
are 
you 
off 
to? 
Stop 
here!" 
voices 
whispered 
to 
Lazarev 
who
did 
not 
know 
where 
to<p>
go. 
Lazarev 
stopped, 
casting 
a 
sidelong 
look 
at
his 
colonel 
in 
alarm. 
His 
face 
twitched, 
as 
often 
happens 
to 
soldiers
called 
before 
the 
ranks.

Napoleon 
slightly 
turned 
his 
head, 
and 
put 
his 
plump 
little 
hand 
out
behind 
him 
as 
if 
to 
take 
something. 
The 
members 
of 
his 
suite, 
guessing
at 
once 
what 
he 
wanted, 
moved 
about 
and 
whispered 
as

Then

with

a

over

had 
the
faculty, 
so 
invaluable 
in 
society, 
of 
composure 
and 
imperturbable
self-possession. 
If 
a 
man 
lacking 
in 
self-confidence 
remains 
dumb 
on
a 
first 
introduction 
and 
betrays 
a 
consciousness 
of 
the 
impropriety 
of
such 
silence 
and 
an 
anxiety 
to 
find 
something 
to 
say, 
the 
effect 
is
bad. 
But 
Anatole 
was 
dumb, 
swung 
his 
foot, 
and 
smilingly 
examined 
the
princess' 
hair. 
It 
was 
evident 
that 
he 
could 
be 
silent 
in 
this 
way 
for
a 
very<p>
long 
time. 
"If 
anyone 
finds 
this 
silence 
inconvenient, 
let 
him
talk, 
but 
I 
don't 
want 
to," 
he 
seemed 
to 
say. 
Besides 
this, 
in 
his
behavior 
to 
women 
Anatole 
had 
a 
manner 
which 
particularly 
inspires 
in
them 
curiosity, 
awe, 
and 
even 
love-a 
supercilious 
consciousness 
of
his 
own 
superiority. 
It 
was 
as 
if 
he 
said 
to 
them: 
"I 
know 
you, 
I 
know
you, 
but 
why 
should 
I 
bother 
about 
you? 
You'd 
be 
only 
too 
glad, 
of
course." 
Perhaps 
he 
did 
not 
really 
think 
this 
when 
he 
met 
women-even
probably 
he 
did 
not, 
for 
in 
general 
he 
thought 
very 
little-but 
his
looks 
and 
manner 
gave 
that 
impression. 
The 
princess 
felt 
this, 
and 
as 
if
wishing 
to 
show 
him 
that 
she 
did 
not 
even 
dare 
expect 
to 
interest 
him,
she 
turned 
to 
his 
father. 
The 
conversation 
was 
general 
and 
animated,
thanks 
to 
Princess 
Lise's 
voice 
and 
little 
downy 
lip 
that 
lifted

"What 
next?" 
the 
princess 
interrupted, 
smiling 
sardonically 
and 
not
changing 
the 
expression 
of 
her 
eyes. 
"I 
am 
a

added, 
as 
if 
supposing 
that 
this 
translation 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rz63KSVyY0ws.html">the

would 
effectively 
prove 
to 
Prince 
Vasili 
the 
invalidity 
of 
his
contention.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
A

"Well,

has 
written

begging 
him 
to 
recognize

it

that

will

That's

* 
And 
all 
that 
follows 
therefrom.

"I 
know 
the 
will 
was 
made, 
but 
I 
also 
know 
that 
it 
is 
invalid;
and 
you,

to

said 
the
princess 
with 
the 
expression 
women 
assume 
when 
they 
suppose 
they 
are
saying 
something 
witty<p>
and 
stinging.

"My 
dear 
Princess 
Catherine 
Semenovna," 
began 
Prince 
Vasili
impatiently, 
"I 
came 
here 
not 
to 
wrangle 
with 
you, 
but 
to 
talk 
about
your 
interests 
as 
with 
a 
kinswoman, 
a 
good, 
kind, 
true 
relation. 
And 
I
tell 
you 
for 
the 
tenth 
time 
that 
if 
the 
letter 
to 
the 
Emperor 
and 
the
will 
in 
Pierre's 
favor 
are 
among 
the<p>

then,

have 
just 
been 
talking 
to 
Dmitri 
Onufrich"
(the 
family 
solicitor) 
"and 
he 
says 
the 
same."

At 
this 
a 
sudden 
change 
evidently 
took 
place 
in 
the 
princess' 
ideas;
her 
thin 
lips 
grew 
white, 
though 
her 
eyes 
did 
not 
change, 
and 
her 
voice
when 
she 
began 
to 
speak 
passed 
through 
such 
transitions 
as 
she 
herself
evidently 
did 
not 
expect.

"That 
would 
be 
a 
fine 
thing!" 
said<p>
she. 
"I<p>
never 
wanted 
anything
and 
I 
don't 
now."

She 
pushed 
the 
little 
dog 
off 
her 
lap 
and 
smoothed 
her 
dress.

"And 
this 
is 
gratitude-this 
is 
recognition 
for 
those 
who 
have
sacrificed 
everything 
for 
his 
sake!" 
she 
cried. 
"It's 
splendid!
Fine! 
I 
don't

"Yes,

replied 
Prince 
Vasili.

But 
the

did 
not 
listen 
to 
him.

"Yes,

"I? 
Yes,

cried 
Petya, 
blushing 
almost 
to 
tears 
and
glancing 
at 
Denisov.

While 
Dolokhov

disputing 
with 
Denisov 
what

"If

And 
to 
all 
Denisov's

Petya 
replied 
that

not

and 
that

CHAPTER 
IX

Having 
put 
on 
French 
greatcoats 
and 
shakos, 
Petya 
and 
Dolokhov 
rode 
to
the 
clearing 
from 
which 
Denisov 
had 
reconnoitered 
the 
French 
camp,
and 
emerging 
from 
the 
forest 
in 
pitch 
darkness 
they 
descended 
into 
the
hollow. 
On 
reaching 
the 
bottom, 
Dolokhov 
told 
the 
Cossacks 
accompanying
him 
to 
await 
him 
there 
and 
rode 
on 
at 
a 
quick 
trot 
along 
the 
road 
to 
the
bridge. 
Petya, 
his 
heart 
in 
his 
mouth 
with 
excitement, 
rode 
by 
his 
side.

"If 
we're<p>
caught, 
I 
won't 
be 
taken 
alive! 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk8MCK3bju5WkvgW.html">I</a> 
have 
a 
pistol," 
whispered
he.

"Don't 
talk 
Russian," 
said 
Dolokhov 
in 
a 
hurried 
whisper, 
and 
at 
that
very 
moment 
they 
heard 
through 
the 
darkness 
the 
challenge: 
"Qui 
vive?"<p>
*
and 
the 
click 
of 
a 
musket.

 
 
 
 
* 
"Who 
goes 
there?"


The 
blood 
rushed 
to 
Petya's 
face 
and 
he 
grasped 
his 
pistol.

"Lanciers 
du 
6-me," 
* 
replied 
Dolokhov, 
neither 
hastening 
nor 
slackening
his 
horse's 
pace.

addressed

conveying 
his 
own 
conjectures 
to 
him.

Petya, 
rapidly 
turning 
his 
head, 
looked

at 
the 
drummer 
boy, 
now
at 
Denisov, 
now 
at

now 
at 
the 
French 
in 
the 
village 
and
along 
the 
road, 
trying 
not 
to 
miss 
anything 
of 
importance.

"Whether 
Dolokhov 
comes 
or 
not, 
we 
must 
seize 
it, 
eh?" 
said 
Denisov 
with
a 
merry 
sparkle 
in 
his 
eyes.

"It 
is 
a 
very 
suitable 
spot," 
said 
the 
esaul.

"We'll 
send 
the

Denisov 
continued.
"They'll

How

manly
warrior 
doing 
some 
kind 
of 
man's 
work 
of 
his 
own, 
without 
help 
or
guidance. 
The 
universal 
experience 
of 
ages, 
showing 
that 
children 
do
grow 
imperceptibly 
from 
the<p>
cradle 
to 
manhood, 
did 
not 
exist 
for 
the

Her

at

seemed

that 
the

than 
a 
week 
preparations 
were 
being 
made, 
rough 
drafts 
of
letters 
to 
Nicholas 
from 
all 
the 
household 
were 
written 
and 
copied 
out,
while 
under 
the 
supervision 
of 
the 
countess 
and 
the 
solicitude 
of 
the
count, 
money 
and 
all 
things 
necessary 
for 
the 
uniform 
and 
equipment
of 
the 
newly 
commissioned 
officer 
were 
collected. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna,
practical 
woman 
that 
she 
was, 
had 
even 
managed 
by 
favor 
with 
army
authorities 
to 
secure 
advantageous 
means 
of 
communication 
for 
herself
and 
her 
son. 
She 
had 
opportunities 
of 
sending 
her 
letters 
to 
the 
Grand
Duke 
Constantine 
Pavlovich, 
who 
commanded 
the 
Guards. 
The 
Rostovs
supposed 
that 
The 
Russian 
Guards, 
Abroad, 
was 
quite 
a 
definite 
address,
and 
that 
if 
a 
letter 
reached 
the 
Grand 
Duke 
in 
command 
of 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/MV4i45.html">Guards
there</a> 
was 
no 
reason 
why 
it 
should 
not 
reach 
the 
Pavlograd 
regiment,
which 
was 
presumably 
somewhere 
in 
the 
same<p>
neighborhood. 
And 
so 
it 
was
decided 
to 
send 
the 
letters 
and 
money 
by 
the 
Grand 
Duke's 
courier 
to
Boris 
and 
Boris 
was 
to 
forward 
them 
to 
Nicholas. 
The 
letters 
were 
from
the 
old 
count,

the

and 
drunken 
soldiers 
wandering 
about.

The 
hospital 
was 
in 
a 
brick 
building 
with 
some 
of 
the 
window 
frames 
and
panes 
broken 
and 
a 
courtyard 
surrounded 
by 
the 
remains 
of 
a 
wooden 
fence
that 
had 
been 
pulled 
to 
pieces. 
Several 
bandaged 
soldiers, 
with 
pale
swollen 
faces, 
were 
sitting 
or 
walking 
about 
in 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/GF1Scb11n.html">sunshine</a> 
in 
the
yard.

Directly 
Rostov 
entered 
the 
door 
he 
was 
enveloped 
by 
a 
smell 
of
putrefaction 
and 
hospital 
air. 
On 
the 
stairs 
he 
met 
a 
Russian 
army
doctor 
smoking 
a 
cigar. 
The 
doctor 
was 
followed 
by 
a 
Russian 
assistant.

"I 
can't 
tear 
myself 
to 
pieces," 
the 
doctor 
was 
saying. 
"Come 
to
Makar 
Alexeevich 
in 
the 
evening. 
I 
shall 
be 
there."

The 
assistant 
asked 
some 
further 
questions.

"Oh, 
do 
the 
best 
you 
can! 
Isn't<p>
it 
all 
the 
same?" 
The 
doctor
noticed 
Rostov 
coming 
upstairs.

"What 
do 
you 
want, 
sir?" 
said 
the 
doctor. 
"What 
do 
you 
want?
The 
bullets 
having 
spared 
you, 
do 
you 
want 
to 
try 
typhus? 
This 
is 
a
pesthouse, 
sir."

"How 
so?" 
asked 
Rostov.

"Typhus, 
sir. 
It's 
death 
to 
go 
in. 
Only 
we 
two, 
Makeev 
and 
I" 
(he
pointed 
to 
the 
assistant), 
"keep 
on 
here. 
Some 
five 
of 
us 
doctors 
have
died 
in 
this 
place.... 
When 
a 
new 
one 
comes 
he 
is 
done 
for 
in 
a 
week,"
said 
the 
doctor 
with 
evident 
satisfaction. 
"Prussian 
doctors 
have 
been
invited 
here, 
but 
our 
allies 
don't 
like 
it 
at 
all."

Rostov 
explained 
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
see 
Major 
Denisov 
of 
the 
hussars,
who 
was 
wounded.

"I 
don't 
know. 
I 
can't 
tell 
you, 
sir. 
Only 
think! 
I 
am 
alone 
in
charge 
of 
three 
hospitals 
with 
more 
than 
four 
hundred 
patients! 
It's
well 
that 
the 
charitable 
Prussian 
ladies 
send 
us 
two 
pounds 
of 
coffee
and 
some 
lint 
each 
month 
or 
we 
should 
be 
lost!" 
he 
laughed. 
"Four
hundred, 
sir, 
and 
they're 
always 
sending 
me 
fresh 
ones. 
There 
are 
four
hundred? 
Eh?" 
he 
asked, 
turning 
to 
the 
assistant.

The 
assistant 
looked 
fagged 
out. 
He 
was 
evidently 
vexed 
and 
impatient
for 
the 
talkative 
doctor 
to 
go.

"Major 
Denisov," 
Rostov 
said 
again. 
"He 
was 
wounded 
at
Molliten."

"Dead, 
I 
fancy. 
Eh, 
Makeev?" 
queried 
the 
doctor, 
in 
a 
tone 
of
indifference.

The 
assistant, 
however, 
did 
not 
confirm 
the 
doctor's 
words.

"Is 
he 
tall 
and 
with 
reddish 
hair?" 
asked 
the 
doctor.

Rostov 
described 
Denisov's 
appearance.

"There 
was 
one 
like 
that," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
as 
if 
pleased. 
"That
one 
is 
dead, 
I 
fancy. 
However, 
I'll 
look 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hI3tc2BnCGW3iLv.html">up</a> 
our 
list. 
We 
had 
a 
list.
Have 
you 
got 
it, 
Makeev?"

"Makar 
Alexeevich 
has<p>
the 
list," 
answered 
the 
assistant. 
"But 
if
you'll 
step 
into 
the 
officers' 
wards 
you'll 
see 
for 
yourself,"
he 
added, 
turning 
to 
Rostov.

"Ah, 
you'd 
better 
not 
go, 
sir," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
"or 
you 
may
have 
to 
stay 
here 
yourself."

But 
Rostov 
bowed 
himself 
away 
from 
the 
doctor 
and 
asked 
the 
assistant
to 
show 
him 
the 
way.

"Only 
don't 
blame 
me!" 
the 
doctor 
shouted 
up 
after 
him.

Rostov 
and 
the 
assistant 
went 
into 
the 
dark 
corridor. 
The 
smell 
was 
so
strong 
there 
that 
Rostov 
held 
his 
nose 
and 
had 
to 
pause 
and 
collect
his 
strength 
before 
he 
could 
go 
on. 
A 
door 
opened 
to 
the 
right, 
and 
an
emaciated 
sallow 
man 
on 
crutches, 
barefoot 
and 
in 
underclothing, 
limped
out 
and, 
leaning 
against 
the 
doorpost, 
looked 
with 
glittering 
envious
eyes 
at<p>
those 
who 
were 
passing. 
Glancing 
in 
at 
the 
door, 
Rostov
saw 
that 
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
floor 
on 
straw 
and
overcoats.

"May 
I 
go 
in 
and 
look?"

"What 
is 
there 
to 
see?" 
said 
the 
assistant.

struck 
up 
in

settled 
down 
in

Then 
the

<a href="/cZl/kz9z45.html">the</a>

the

the

At

The

more 
than

Since
September 
2 
Moscow 
has 
been 
in 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
enemy. 
Your 
last 
reports
were 
written 
on

and 
during 
all 
this 
time 
not 
only 
has

for 
the 
relief 
of 
the 
ancient
capital, 
but 
according 
to 
your 
last 
report 
you 
have 
even 
retreated
farther. 
Serpukhov 
is 
already 
occupied 
by 
an 
enemy 
detachment 
and 
Tula
with 
its 
famous 
arsenal, 
so 
indispensable 
to 
<a href="/cZl/YR7wjGAw7v9yeL.html">the</a> 
army, 
is 
in 
danger.
From 
General 
Wintzingerode's 
reports, 
I 
see 
that 
an 
enemy 
corps 
of 
ten
thousand 
men 
is 
moving 
on 
the 
Petersburg 
road. 
Another 
corps 
of 
several
thousand 
men 
is 
moving 
on 
Dmitrov. 
A 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vu6WlHf7HBo5cU.html">third</a>

the

a 
<a href="/cZl/Lx2eI3.html">fourth,</a>

considerable 
detachment 
is 
stationed
between 
Ruza 
and 
Mozhaysk. 
Napoleon 
himself 
was 
in 
Moscow 
as 
late 
as
the 
twenty-fifth. 
In 
view 
of 
all 
this 
information, 
when 
the 
enemy 
has
scattered 
his 
forces 
in 
large 
detachments,

with 
Napoleon 
and 
his

in 
Moscow, 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
the 
enemy's 
forces 
confronting 
you
are 
so 
considerable 
as 
not 
to 
allow 
of 
your 
taking 
the

On 
the

he 
is 
probably 
pursuing 
you 
with

at

with
an

Remember 
that

You

But 
by 
the 
time 
this 
letter, 
which 
proved 
that 
the 
real 
relation 
of
the 
forces 
had 
already 
made 
itself 
felt 
in 
Petersburg, 
was 
dispatched,
Kutuzov 
had 
found 
himself 
unable 
any 
longer 
to 
restrain 
the 
army 
he
commanded 
from 
attacking 
and 
a 
battle 
had 
taken 
place.

On 
the 
second 
of 
October 
a 
Cossack, 
Shapovalov, 
who 
was 
out 
scouting,
killed 
one 
hare 
and 
wounded 
another. 
Following 
the 
wounded 
hare 
he 
made
his 
way 
far 
into 
the 
forest 
and 
came 
upon 
the 
left 
flank 
of 
Murat's
army, 
encamped 
there 
without 
any 
precautions. 
The 
Cossack 
laughingly
told 
his 
comrades 
how 
he 
had 
almost 
fallen 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
the 
French.
A 
cornet, 
hearing 
the 
story, 
informed 
his 
commander.

The 
Cossack 
was 
sent 
for 
and 
questioned. 
The 
Cossack 
officers 
wished
to 
take 
advantage 
of 
this 
chance 
to 
capture 
some 
horses, 
but 
one 
of
the 
superior 
officers, 
who 
was 
acquainted 
with 
the 
higher 
authorities,
reported 
the 
incident 
to 
a

on 
the 
staff. 
The 
state 
of 
things 
on
the

had

been 
exceedingly 
strained. 
Ermolov

been

Bennigsen 
a

days 
previously 
and 
had 
entreated 
him 
to

that 
in 
the

it 
was 
going 
badly.

Rostov 
lived, 
as 
before, 
with 
Denisov, 
and 
since 
their 
furlough 
they
had 
become 
more 
friendly 
than 
ever. 
Denisov 
never 
spoke 
of 
Rostov's
family, 
but 
by 
the 
tender 
friendship 
his 
commander 
showed 
him, 
Rostov
felt 
that 
the 
elder 
hussar's 
luckless 
love 
for 
Natasha 
played 
a<p>
part
in 
strengthening 
their 
friendship. 
Denisov 
evidently 
tried 
to 
expose
Rostov 
to 
danger 
as 
seldom 
as 
possible, 
and 
after 
an 
action 
greeted 
his
safe 
return 
with 
evident<p>
joy. 
On 
one 
of 
his 
foraging 
expeditions, 
in
a 
deserted 
and 
ruined 
village 
to 
which 
he<p>
had 
come 
in 
search 
of
provisions, 
Rostov 
found 
a 
family 
consisting 
of 
an 
old 
Pole 
and 
his
daughter 
with 
an 
infant 
in 
arms. 
They 
were 
half 
clad, 
hungry, 
too 
weak
to 
get 
away 
on 
foot 
and 
had 
no 
means 
of 
obtaining 
a 
conveyance. 
Rostov
brought 
them 
to 
his 
quarters, 
placed 
them 
in 
his 
own 
lodging, 
and
kept 
them 
for 
some 
weeks 
while 
the 
old 
man 
was 
recovering. 
One 
of 
his
comrades, 
talking 
of 
women, 
began 
chaffing 
Rostov, 
saying 
that 
he 
was
more 
wily 
than 
any 
of 
them 
and 
that 
it 
would 
not 
be 
a 
bad 
thing 
if 
he
introduced 
to 
them 
the 
pretty 
Polish 
girl 
he 
had 
saved. 
Rostov 
took
the 
joke 
as 
an 
insult, 
flared 
up, 
and 
said 
such 
unpleasant 
things 
to 
the
officer 
that 
it 
was 
all 
Denisov 
could 
do 
to 
prevent 
a 
duel. 
When
the 
officer 
had 
gone 
away, 
Denisov, 
who 
did 
not 
himself 
know 
what
Rostov's 
relations 
with 
the 
Polish 
girl 
might 
be, 
began 
to 
upbraid
him 
for 
his 
quickness 
of 
temper, 
and 
Rostov 
replied:

"Say 
what 
you 
like.... 
She 
is 
like 
a 
sister 
to 
me, 
and 
I 
can't 
tell
you 
how 
it 
offended 
me... 
because... 
well, 
for 
that 
reason...."

Denisov 
patted 
him 
on 
the 
shoulder 
and 
began 
rapidly 
pacing 
the 
room
without 
looking 
at 
Rostov, 
as 
was 
his 
way 
at 
moments 
of 
deep 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UB3e1Gbiq7hBn.html">feeling.

"Ah,</a> 
what 
a 
mad 
bweed 
you 
Wostovs 
are!" 
he 
muttered, 
and 
Rostov
noticed 
tears 
in 
his 
eyes.





CHAPTER 
XVI

In

the 
troops 
were 
enlivened 
by 
news 
<a href="/cZl/mf16LgATt.html">of</a> 
the 
Emperor's

but 
Rostov

no

and 
Rostov

in

out 
for 
them 
by 
the

he 
liked 
done 
always. 
He 
had 
only 
to 
express 
a
wish 
and 
Natasha 
would 
jump 
up 
and 
run 
to 
fulfill 
it.

The 
entire 
household 
was 
governed 
according 
to 
Pierre's 
supposed 
orders,
that 
is, 
by 
his 
wishes 
which 
Natasha 
tried 
to 
guess. 
Their 
way 
of
life 
and 
place 
of 
residence, 
their 
acquaintances 
and 
ties, 
Natasha's
occupations, 
the 
children's 
upbringing, 
were 
all 
selected 
not 
merely
with 
regard 
to 
Pierre's 
expressed 
wishes, 
but 
to 
what 
Natasha 
from 
the
thoughts 
he 
expressed 
in 
conversation 
supposed 
his 
wishes 
to 
be. 
And 
she
deduced<p>
the 
essentials 
of 
his 
wishes 
quite 
correctly, 
and 
having 
once
arrived 
at 
them 
clung 
to 
them 
tenaciously. 
When 
Pierre 
himself 
wanted 
to
change 
his 
mind 
she 
would 
fight 
him 
with 
his 
own 
weapons.

Thus 
in 
a 
time 
of 
trouble 
ever 
memorable 
to 
him 
after 
the 
birth 
of 
their
first 
child 
who 
<a href="/cZl/WM2bOIDr5ZUI3HI.html">was</a> 
delicate, 
when 
they 
had 
to 
change 
the 
wet 
nurse
three 
times 
and 
Natasha 
fell 
ill 
from 
despair, 
Pierre 
one 
day 
told 
her
of 
Rousseau's 
view, 
with 
which 
he 
quite 
agreed, 
that 
to 
have 
a 
wet
nurse 
is 
unnatural 
and 
harmful. 
When 
her 
next 
baby 
was 
born, 
despite
the 
opposition 
of 
her 
mother, 
the 
doctors, 
and 
even 
of 
her 
husband
himself-who 
were 
all 
vigorously 
opposed 
to 
her 
nursing 
her 
baby 
herself,
a 
thing 
then 
unheard 
of 
<a href="/cZl/mD6YysHj7DbPtL9cw.html">and</a> 
considered 
injurious-she 
insisted 
on 
having
her 
own 
way, 
and 
after 
that 
nursed 
all 
her 
babies 
herself.

It 
very 
often 
happened 
that 
in 
a 
moment 
of 
irritation 
husband 
and 
wife
would<p>
have 
a 
dispute, 
but 
long 
afterwards 
Pierre 
to 
his 
surprise 
and
delight 
would 
find 
in 
his 
wife's 
ideas 
and 
actions 
the 
very 
thought
against 
which 
she 
had 
argued, 
but 
divested 
of 
everything 
superfluous
that 
in 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
dispute 
he 
had 
added 
when 
expressing 
his
opinion.

After 
seven 
years 
of 
marriage 
Pierre 
had 
the 
joyous 
and 
firm
consciousness 
that 
he 
was 
not 
a 
bad 
man, 
and 
he 
felt 
this 
because 
he 
saw
himself 
reflected 
in 
his 
wife. 
He 
felt 
the 
good<p>
and 
bad 
within 
himself
inextricably 
mingled 
and 
overlapping. 
But 
only 
what 
was 
really 
good 
in
him 
was 
reflected 
in 
his 
wife, 
all 
that 
was 
not<p>
quite 
good 
was 
rejected.
And 
this 
was 
not 
the 
result 
of 
logical 
reasoning 
but 
was 
a 
direct 
and
mysterious 
reflection.





CHAPTER 
XI

Two 
months 
previously 
when 
Pierre 
was 
already 
staying 
with 
the 
Rostovs
he 
had 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Prince 
Theodore, 
asking 
him 
to 
come
to 
Petersburg 
to 
confer 
on 
some 
important 
questions 
that 
were 
being
discussed 
there 
by 
a 
society 
of 
which 
Pierre 
was 
one 
of 
the 
principal
founders.

On 
reading 
that 
letter 
(she 
always 
read 
her 
husband's 
letters) 
Natasha
herself 
suggested 
that 
he 
should 
go 
<a href="/aVzUge/PN38Yg1sbb.html">to</a> 
Petersburg, 
though 
she 
would 
feel
his 
absence 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qr1Kzb7vGF4NbF.html">very</a> 
acutely. 
She 
attributed 
immense 
importance 
to 
all
her 
husband's 
intellectual 
and 
abstract<p>
interests 
though 
she 
did 
not
understand 
them, 
and 
she 
always 
dreaded 
being 
a 
hindrance 
to 
him 
in 
such
matters. 
To 
Pierre's 
timid 
look 
of 
inquiry 
after 
reading 
the 
letter 
she
replied 
by 
asking 
him 
to 
go, 
but 
to 
fix 
a 
definite 
date 
for

CHAPTER 
VIII

The 
war 
was 
flaming 
up 
and 
nearing 
the 
Russian 
frontier. 
Everywhere 
one
heard 
curses 
on 
Bonaparte, 
"the 
enemy 
of 
mankind." 
Militiamen 
and
recruits 
were 
being 
enrolled 
in 
the 
villages, 
and 
from 
the 
seat 
of
war 
came 
contradictory 
news, 
false 
as 
usual 
and 
therefore 
variously
interpreted. 
The 
life 
of 
old 
Prince 
Bolkonski, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and
Princess 
Mary 
<a href="/aVzUge/MV4i45.html">had</a> 
greatly 
changed 
since 
1805.

In 
1806 
the 
old 
prince 
was 
made 
one 
of 
the 
eight 
commanders 
in 
chief
then 
appointed 
to 
supervise 
the 
enrollment 
decreed 
throughout 
Russia.
Despite 
the 
weakness 
of 
age, 
which 
had 
become 
particularly 
noticeable
since 
the 
time 
when 
he 
thought 
his 
son 
had 
been 
killed, 
he 
did 
not 
think
it 
right 
to 
refuse 
a<p>
duty 
to 
which 
he 
had 
been 
appointed 
by 
the 
Emperor
himself, 
and 
this 
fresh 
opportunity 
for 
action 
gave 
him 
new 
energy
and 
strength. 
He 
was 
continually 
traveling 
through 
the 
three 
provinces
entrusted 
to 
him, 
was 
pedantic 
in 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
his 
duties, 
severe
to 
cruel 
with 
his 
subordinates, 
and 
went 
into 
everything 
down 
to 
the
minutest 
details<p>
himself. 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/Wt8C0oW8ZkSv.html">Princess</a> 
Mary 
had 
ceased 
taking 
lessons 
in
mathematics 
from 
her 
father, 
and 
when 
the 
old 
prince 
was 
at 
home 
went
to 
his 
study 
with 
the 
wet 
nurse 
and 
little 
Prince 
Nicholas 
(as 
his
grandfather 
called 
him). 
The 
baby 
Prince 
Nicholas 
lived 
with 
his 
wet
nurse 
and 
nurse 
Savishna 
in 
the 
late 
princess' 
rooms 
and 
Princess
Mary 
spent 
most 
of 
the 
day 
in 
the 
nursery, 
taking 
a 
mother's 
place 
to
her 
little 
nephew 
as<p>
best 
she 
could. 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
too, 
seemed
passionately 
fond 
of 
the 
boy, 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
often 
deprived 
herself
to 
give 
her 
friend 
the 
pleasure 
of 
dandling 
the 
little 
<a href="/aVzUge/hW2bXmQ81KA.html">angel-as</a> 
she
called 
her<p>
nephew-and 
playing 
with 
him.

Near 
the 
altar 
of 
the 
church 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
there 
was 
a 
chapel 
over 
the
tomb 
of 
the 
little 
princess, 
and 
in 
this 
chapel 
was 
a 
marble 
monument
brought 
from 
Italy, 
representing 
an 
angel 
with 
outspread 
wings 
ready 
to
fly 
upwards. 
The 
angel's 
upper 
lip 
was 
slightly 
raised 
as 
though
about 
to 
smile, 
and 
once 
on 
coming 
out 
of 
the 
chapel 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
Princess 
Mary 
admitted 
to 
one 
another 
that 
the 
angel's 
face 
reminded
them 
strangely 
of 
the 
little 
princess.

CHAPTER 
VII

Two 
of 
the 
enemy's 
shots 
had 
already 
flown 
across 
the 
bridge, 
where
there 
was 
a 
crush. 
Halfway 
across 
stood 
Prince 
Nesvitski, 
who 
had
alighted 
from 
his 
horse 
and 
whose 
big 
body 
was 
jammed 
against 
the
railings. 
He 
looked 
back 
laughing 
to 
the 
Cossack 
who 
stood 
a 
few
steps 
behind 
him 
holding 
two 
horses 
by 
their 
bridles. 
Each 
time 
Prince
Nesvitski 
tried 
to 
move 
on, 
soldiers 
and 
carts 
pushed 
him 
back 
again
and 
pressed 
him 
against 
the 
railings, 
and 
all 
he 
could 
do 
was 
to 
smile.

"What 
a 
fine 
fellow 
you 
are, 
friend!" 
said 
the 
Cossack 
to 
a 
convoy
soldier 
with 
a 
wagon, 
who 
was 
pressing 
onto 
the 
infantrymen 
who 
were
crowded<p>
together 
close 
to 
his 
wheels 
and 
his 
horses. 
"What 
a<p>
fellow!
You 
can't 
wait 
a 
moment! 
Don't 
you 
see 
the 
general 
wants 
to 
pass?"

But 
the 
convoyman 
took 
no 
notice 
of 
the 
word 
"general" 
and<p>
shouted
at 
the 
soldiers 
who 
were 
blocking 
his 
way. 
"Hi 
there, 
boys! 
Keep 
to
the 
left! 
Wait 
a 
bit." 
But 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Bw1ws4vVJZj8mJ.html">soldiers,</a> 
crowded

moved 
over 
the

in 
a 
dense
mass.

over

Prince 
Nesvitski 
saw 
the

noisy
little 
waves 
of 
the

On 
the 
twenty-fourth 
the 
weather 
cleared 
up 
after 
a 
spell 
of 
rain, 
and
after 
dinner 
Pierre 
left 
Moscow. 
When 
changing 
horses 
that 
night
in 
Perkhushkovo, 
he 
learned 
that 
there 
had 
been 
a 
great 
battle 
that
evening. 
(This 
was 
the 
battle 
of 
Shevardino.) 
He 
was 
told 
that 
there 
in
Perkhushkovo 
the 
earth 
trembled 
from 
the 
firing, 
but 
nobody 
could 
answer
his 
questions 
as 
to 
who 
had 
won. 
At 
dawn 
next 
day 
Pierre 
was 
approaching
Mozhaysk.

Every 
house 
in 
Mozhaysk 
had 
soldiers 
quartered 
in 
it, 
and 
at 
the 
hostel
where 
Pierre 
was 
met 
by<p>
his 
groom 
and 
coachman 
there 
was 
no 
room 
to 
be
had. 
It 
was 
full 
of 
officers.

Everywhere 
in 
Mozhaysk 
and 
beyond 
it, 
troops 
were 
stationed 
or 
on 
the
march.<p>
Cossacks, 
foot 
and 
horse 
soldiers, 
wagons, 
caissons, 
and 
cannon
were 
everywhere. 
Pierre 
pushed 
forward 
as 
fast 
as 
he 
could, 
and 
the
farther 
he 
left 
Moscow 
behind 
and 
the 
deeper 
he 
plunged 
into 
that 
sea
of 
troops 
the 
more 
was 
he 
overcome 
by 
restless 
agitation 
and 
a 
new 
and
joyful 
feeling 
he 
had 
not 
experienced 
before. 
It 
was 
a 
feeling<p>
akin
to 
what 
he 
had 
felt 
at 
the 
Sloboda 
Palace 
during 
the 
Emperor's 
visit-a
sense 
of 
the 
necessity 
of<p>
undertaking 
something 
and 
sacrificing
something. 
He 
now 
experienced 
a 
glad 
consciousness 
that 
everything 
that
constitutes 
men's 
happiness-the 
comforts 
of 
life, 
wealth, 
even
life 
itself-is 
rubbish 
it 
is 
pleasant 
to 
throw 
away,

something... 
With 
what?<p>
Pierre 
could 
not 
say, 
and 
he 
did 
not 
try 
to
determine 
for 
whom 
and 
for 
what 
he 
felt 
such 
particular 
delight 
in
sacrificing 
everything. 
He 
was 
not 
occupied 
with 
the 
question 
of 
what 
to
sacrifice 
for; 
the 
fact 
of 
sacrificing 
<a href="/cZl/YF1n5xhd4CKY.html">in</a> 
itself 
afforded 
him 
a 
new 
and
joyous 
sensation.





CHAPTER 
XIX

On 
the 
twenty-fourth 
of 
August 
the 
battle 
of 
the 
Shevardino 
Redoubt 
was
fought, 
on 
the 
twenty-fifth 
not 
a 
shot 
was 
fired 
by 
either 
side, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Lg4mbmX92JyP.html">on
the</a> 
twenty-sixth 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
itself 
took 
place.

Why<p>
and 
how 
were 
the 
battles 
of 
Shevardino 
and 
Borodino 
given 
and
accepted? 
Why 
was 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
fought? 
There 
was 
not 
the 
least
sense 
in 
it 
for 
either 
the 
French 
or 
the 
Russians. 
Its 
immediate 
result
for 
the 
Russians 
was, 
and 
was 
bound 
to 
be, 
that 
we 
were 
brought 
nearer
to 
the 
destruction 
of 
Moscow-which 
we 
feared 
more 
than 
anything 
in
the 
world; 
and 
for 
the 
French 
its 
immediate 
result 
was 
that 
they 
were
brought 
nearer 
to 
the 
destruction 
of 
their 
whole 
army-which 
they 
feared
more 
than 
anything 
in 
the 
world. 
What 
the 
result 
must 
be 
<a href="/cZl/db9CT7KA0Nz.html">was</a> 
quite
obvious, 
and 
yet 
Napoleon 
offered 
and 
Kutuzov 
accepted 
that 
battle.

If 
the 
commanders 
had 
been 
guided 
by 
reason,<p>
it 
would 
seem 
that 
it 
must
have 
been 
obvious 
to 
Napoleon 
that 
by 
advancing 
thirteen 
hundred 
miles
and 
giving 
battle 
with 
a 
probability 
of 
losing 
a 
quarter 
of 
his 
army,
he 
was 
advancing 
to 
certain 
destruction, 
and 
it 
must 
have 
been 
equally
clear 
to 
Kutuzov 
that 
by 
accepting<p>
battle 
and<p>
risking 
the 
loss 
of 
a
quarter 
of 
his 
army 
he 
would 
certainly 
lose 
Moscow. 
For 
Kutuzov 
this 
was
mathematically 
clear, 
as 
it 
is 
that 
if 
<a href="/aVzUge/Zhu4x3pbE.html">when</a> 
playing 
draughts 
I 
have 
one
man 
less 
and 
go 
on 
exchanging, 
I 
shall 
certainly 
lose, 
and 
therefore
should 
not 
exchange. 
When 
my 
opponent 
has 
sixteen 
men 
and 
I 
have
fourteen, 
I 
am 
only 
one 
eighth 
weaker 
than 
he, 
but 
when 
I 
have 
exchanged
thirteen 
more 
men 
he 
will 
be 
three<p>
times 
as 
strong 
as 
I 
am.

Before 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
our 
strength 
in 
proportion<p>
to 
the 
French
was 
about 
as 
five 
to 
six, 
but 
after 
that 
battle 
it 
was 
little 
more 
than
one 
to 
two: 
previously 
we 
had 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
against 
a 
hundred 
and
twenty 
thousand; 
afterwards 
little 
more 
than 
fifty 
thousand 
against 
a
hundred 
thousand. 
Yet 
the 
shrewd 
and 
experienced 
Kutuzov 
accepted 
the
battle,

CHAPTER 
V

While 
waiting 
for 
the 
announcement 
of 
his 
appointment 
to 
the 
committee
Prince 
Andrew 
looked 
up 
his 
former 
acquaintances, 
particularly 
those 
he
knew 
to 
be 
in 
power 
and 
whose 
aid 
he 
might 
need. 
In 
Petersburg 
he 
now
experienced 
the 
same 
feeling 
he 
had 
had 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
a 
battle, 
when
troubled 
<a href="/cZl/sV8C5fPTu.html">by</a> 
anxious 
curiosity 
and 
irresistibly 
attracted 
to 
the 
ruling
circles 
where 
the 
future, 
on 
which 
the 
fate 
of 
millions 
depended, 
was
being 
shaped. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ovD8iLv86kW.html">From</a> 
the 
irritation 
of 
the 
older 
men, 
the 
curiosity 
of 
the
uninitiated, 
the 
reserve 
of 
the 
initiated, 
the 
hurry 
and 
preoccupation
of 
everyone, 
and 
the 
innumerable 
committees 
and 
commissions 
of 
whose
existence 
he 
learned 
every 
day, 
he 
felt 
that 
now, 
in 
1809, 
here 
in
Petersburg 
a 
vast 
civil 
conflict 
was 
in 
preparation, 
the 
commander 
in
chief 
of 
which 
was 
a 
mysterious 
person 
he 
did 
not 
know, 
but 
who 
was
supposed 
<a href="/aVzUge/Nb5NPT0rP2WUDW.html">to</a> 
be 
a 
man 
of 
genius-Speranski. 
And 
this 
movement 
of
reconstruction 
of 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
a 
vague 
idea, 
and 
Speranski
its 
chief 
promoter, 
began 
to 
interest 
him 
so 
keenly 
that 
the 
question
of 
the 
army 
regulations 
quickly 
receded 
to 
a 
secondary 
place 
in<p>
his
consciousness.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
most 
favorably 
placed 
to 
secure 
good 
reception 
in 
the
highest 
and 
most 
diverse 
Petersburg 
circles 
of 
the 
day. 
The 
reforming
party 
cordially 
welcomed 
and<p>
courted 
him, 
in 
the 
first 
place 
because
he 
was 
reputed 
to 
be 
clever 
and 
very 
well 
read, 
and 
secondly 
because 
by
liberating 
his 
serfs 
he 
had 
obtained 
the 
reputation 
of 
being 
a 
liberal.
The 
party 
of 
the 
old 
and 
dissatisfied, 
who 
censured 
the 
innovations,
turned 
to 
him 
expecting 
his 
sympathy 
in 
their 
disapproval 
of 
the
reforms, 
simply 
because 
he 
was 
the 
son 
of 
his 
father. 
The 
feminine
society 
world 
welcomed 
him 
gladly, 
because 
he 
was 
rich, 
distinguished, 
a
good 
match, 
and 
almost 
a 
newcomer, 
with 
a 
halo 
of 
romance 
on 
account
of 
his 
supposed 
death 
and 
the 
tragic 
loss 
of 
his 
wife. 
Besides 
this
the 
general 
opinion 
of 
all 
who 
had 
known 
him 
previously 
was 
that 
he 
had
greatly 
improved 
during<p>
these 
last 
five 
years, 
having 
softened 
and 
grown
more 
manly, 
lost 
his 
former 
affectation, 
pride, 
and 
contemptuous 
irony,
and 
acquired 
the 
serenity 
that 
comes 
with 
years. 
People 
talked 
about
him, 
were 
interested 
in 
him, 
and 
wanted 
to 
meet 
him.

The 
day 
after 
his 
interview 
with 
Count 
Arakcheev, 
Prince 
Andrew 
spent
the 
evening 
at 
Count 
Kochubey's. 
He 
told 
the 
count 
of 
his 
interview
with 
Sila 
Andreevich 
(Kochubey 
spoke<p>
of 
Arakcheev 
by 
that 
nickname
with 
the 
same 
vague 
irony 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
noticed 
in 
the 
Minister 
of
War's 
anteroom).

"Mon 
cher, 
even 
in 
this 
case 
you 
can't 
do 
without 
Michael
Mikhaylovich 
Speranski. 
He 
manages 
everything. 
I'll 
speak<p>
to 
him. 
He
has 
promised 
to 
come 
this 
evening."

"What 
has 
Speranski 
to 
do 
with 
the 
army 
regulations?" 
asked 
Prince
Andrew.

Kochubey 
shook 
his 
head 
smilingly, 
as 
if 
surprised 
at 
Bolkonski's
simplicity.

"We 
were 
talking 
to 
him<p>
about 
you 
a 
few 
days 
ago," 
Kochubey
continued, 
"and 
about 
your 
freed 
plowmen."

"Oh, 
is 
it 
you, 
Prince, 
who 
have 
freed 
your 
serfs?" 
said 
an 
old 
man
of 
Catherine's 
day, 
turning 
contemptuously 
toward 
Bolkonski.

"It 
was 
a 
small 
estate 
that 
brought 
in 
no 
profit," 
replied 
Prince
Andrew, 
trying 
to 
extenuate 
his 
action 
so 
as 
not 
to 
irritate 
the 
old 
man
uselessly.

"Afraid 
of 
being 
late..." 
said 
the 
old 
man, 
looking 
at 
Kochubey.

"There's 
one 
thing 
I 
don't 
understand," 
he 
continued. 
"Who
will 
plow 
the 
land 
if 
they 
are 
set 
free? 
It 
is 
easy 
to 
write 
laws,

CHAPTER 
XVI

Not 
only 
did 
Prince 
Andrew 
know 
he 
would 
die, 
but 
he 
felt 
that 
he 
was
dying 
and 
was 
already 
half 
dead. 
He 
was 
conscious 
of 
an 
aloofness 
from
everything 
earthly 
and 
a 
strange 
and 
joyous 
lightness 
of 
existence.
Without 
haste 
or 
agitation 
he 
awaited 
what 
was 
coming. 
That 
inexorable,
eternal, 
distant, 
and 
unknown 
the 
presence 
of 
which 
he 
had 
felt
continually 
all 
his 
life-was 
now 
near 
to 
him 
and, 
by 
the 
strange
lightness 
he 
experienced, 
almost 
comprehensible 
and 
palpable....


Formerly 
he 
had 
feared 
the 
end.

had

"She's

Soon 
after 
"Uncle's"

the

was 
opened, 
evidently
from 
the 
sound 
by 
a 
barefooted 
girl,<p>

a 
stout,

about 
forty,

a

With

seized

with 
small 
bony

And 
latterly, 
to 
her 
surprise 
and 
bewilderment, 
Princess 
Mary
noticed 
that 
her 
father<p>
was 
really 
associating 
more 
and 
more 
with 
the
Frenchwoman. 
She 
wrote 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
about 
the 
reception 
of 
his
letter, 
but 
comforted 
him 
with 
hopes 
of 
reconciling 
their 
father 
to 
the
idea.

Little 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
education, 
her 
brother 
Andrew, 
and 
religion
were 
Princess 
Mary's 
joys<p>
and 
consolations; 
but 
besides 
that, 
since
everyone 
must 
have 
personal 
hopes, 
Princess 
Mary 
in 
the 
profoundest
depths 
of 
her 
heart 
had 
a 
hidden 
dream 
and 
hope 
that 
supplied 
the 
chief
consolation 
of 
her 
life. 
This 
comforting 
dream 
and 
hope 
were 
given 
her
by 
God's 
folk-the 
half-witted 
and 
other 
pilgrims 
who 
visited
her 
without 
the 
prince's 
knowledge. 
The 
longer 
she 
lived, 
the 
more
experience 
and 
observation 
she 
had 
of 
life, 
the 
greater 
was 
her 
wonder
at 
the 
short-sightedness 
of 
men 
who 
seek 
enjoyment 
and 
happiness 
here
on 
earth: 
toiling, 
suffering, 
struggling, 
and 
harming 
one 
another, 
to
obtain 
that 
impossible, 
visionary, 
sinful 
happiness. 
Prince 
Andrew 
had
loved 
his 
<a href="/aVzUge/cF9JCLL4k6.html">wife,</a> 
she 
died, 
but 
that 
was 
not 
enough: 
he 
wanted 
to 
bind
his 
happiness 
to 
another 
woman. 
Her 
father 
objected 
to 
this 
because 
he
wanted 
a 
more 
distinguished 
and 
wealthier 
match 
for 
Andrew. 
And 
they
all 
struggled 
and 
suffered 
and 
tormented 
one 
another 
and 
injured 
their
souls, 
their 
eternal 
souls, 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
benefits 
which 
endure
but 
for 
an 
instant. 
Not 
only 
do 
we 
know 
this 
ourselves, 
but 
Christ, 
the
Son 
of 
God, 
came 
down 
to 
earth 
and 
told 
us 
that 
this 
life 
is 
but 
for
a 
moment 
and 
is 
a 
probation; 
yet 
we 
cling 
to 
it 
and 
think 
to 
find
happiness 
in<p>
it. 
"How 
is 
it 
that 
no 
one 
realizes 
this?" 
thought
Princess 
Mary. 
"No 
one 
except 
these 
despised 
God's 
folk 
who, 
wallet
on 
back, 
come 
to 
me 
by 
the 
back 
door, 
afraid 
of 
being 
seen 
by 
the
prince, 
not 
for 
fear 
of 
ill-usage 
by 
him 
but 
for 
fear 
of 
causing 
him
to 
sin. 
To 
leave 
family, 
home, 
and 
all 
the 
cares 
of 
worldly 
welfare, 
in
order 
without 
clinging 
to 
anything 
to 
wander 
in 
hempen 
rags 
from 
place
to 
place 
under 
an 
assumed 
name, 
doing 
no 
one 
any 
harm 
but 
praying 
for
all-for 
those 
who 
drive 
one 
away 
as 
well 
as 
for 
those 
who 
protect 
one:
higher 
than 
that 
life 
and 
truth 
there 
is 
no<p>
life 
or 
truth!"

There 
was 
one 
pilgrim, 
a 
quiet 
pockmarked 
little 
woman 
of 
fifty 
called
Theodosia, 
who 
for 
over 
thirty 
years 
had 
gone 
about 
barefoot 
and 
worn
heavy 
chains. 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
particularly 
fond 
of 
her. 
Once, 
when 
in
a 
room 
with 
a 
lamp 
dimly 
lit 
<a href="/aVzUge/kZ8e24mbEd.html">before</a> 
the 
icon 
Theodosia 
was 
talking 
of
her 
life, 
the 
thought 
that 
Theodosia 
alone 
had 
found 
the 
true 
path 
of
life 
suddenly 
came 
to 
Princess 
Mary 
with 
such 
force 
that 
she 
resolved 
to
become 
a 
pilgrim 
herself. 
When 
Theodosia 
had 
gone 
to 
sleep 
Princess 
Mary
thought 
about 
this 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
at 
last 
made 
up 
her 
mind 
that,
strange 
as 
it 
might 
seem, 
she 
must 
go 
on 
a 
pilgrimage. 
She<p>
disclosed
this 
thought 
to 
no 
one 
but 
to 
her 
confessor, 
Father 
Akinfi, 
the 
monk,
and 
he 
approved 
of 
her 
intention. 
Under 
guise 
of<p>
a 
present 
for 
the
pilgrims, 
Princess 
Mary 
prepared 
a 
pilgrim's 
complete 
costume 
for
herself: 
a 
coarse 
smock, 
bast 
shoes, 
a 
rough 
coat, 
and 
a 
black 
kerchief.
Often, 
approaching 
the 
chest 
of 
drawers 
containing 
this 
secret 
treasure,
Princess 
Mary 
paused, 
uncertain 
whether 
the 
time 
had 
not 
already 
come 
to
put 
her 
project 
into 
execution.

Often, 
listening 
to 
the 
pilgrims' 
tales, 
she 
was 
so 
stimulated 
by
their 
simple 
speech, 
mechanical 
to 
them 
but 
to 
her 
so 
full 
of 
deep
meaning, 
that 
several 
times 
she 
was 
on 
the 
point 
of 
abandoning
everything 
and 
running 
away 
from 
home. 
In 
imagination 
she 
already
pictured 
herself 
by 
Theodosia's 
side, 
dressed 
in 
coarse 
rags, 
walking
with 
a 
staff, 
a 
wallet 
on 
her

"Not

Perhaps 
I

right, 
I 
have 
drunk 
a 
good 
deal-but 
that 
is 
how 
I

and
so 
do 
you

To 
the 
health 
of 
Alexander 
the 
First! 
Hurrah!"

"Hurrah!" 
rang 
the 
enthusiastic 
voices 
of 
the 
officers.

And 
the 
old 
cavalry 
captain, 
Kirsten, 
shouted 
enthusiastically 
and 
no
less 
sincerely 
than 
the 
twenty-year-old 
Rostov.

When 
the 
officers 
had 
emptied 
and 
smashed 
their 
glasses, 
Kirsten 
filled
others 
and, 
in 
shirt 
sleeves 
and 
breeches, 
went 
glass 
in 
hand 
to 
the
soldiers' 
bonfires 
and 
with 
his 
long 
gray 
mustache, 
his 
white 
chest
showing 
under 
his 
open 
shirt, 
he 
stood 
in 
a 
majestic 
pose 
in 
the 
light
of 
the<p>
campfire, 
waving 
his 
uplifted 
arm.

"Lads! 
here's 
to 
our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
victory 
over
our 
enemies! 
Hurrah!" 
he 
exclaimed 
in 
his 
dashing, 
old, 
hussar's
baritone.

The 
hussars 
crowded 
round 
and 
responded 
heartily 
with 
loud 
shouts.

Late 
that 
night, 
when 
all 
had 
separated, 
Denisov 
with 
his 
short 
hand
patted 
his 
favorite, 
Rostov, 
on 
the 
shoulder.

"As 
there's 
no 
one 
to 
fall 
in 
love 
with 
on 
campaign, 
he's 
fallen
in 
love 
with 
the 
Tsar," 
he 
said.

"Denisov, 
don't 
make 
fun 
of 
it!" 
cried<p>
Rostov. 
"It 
is 
such 
a
lofty, 
beautiful 
feeling, 
such 
a..."

"I 
believe 
it, 
I 
believe 
it, 
fwiend, 
and 
I 
share 
and

"No, 
you 
don't 
understand!"

And 
Rostov 
got 
up 
and 
went 
wandering 
among 
the 
campfires, 
dreaming 
of
what 
happiness 
it 
would<p>
be 
to 
die-not 
in 
saving 
the 
Emperor's 
life
(he 
did 
not 
even 
dare<p>
to 
dream 
of 
that), 
but 
simply 
to 
die 
before 
his
eyes. 
He 
really 
was 
in 
love 
with 
the 
Tsar 
and 
the 
glory 
of 
the 
Russian
arms 
and 
the 
hope 
of 
future 
triumph. 
And 
he 
was 
not 
the 
only 
man 
to
experience 
that 
feeling 
during 
those 
memorable 
days 
preceding 
the 
battle
of 
Austerlitz: 
nine 
tenths 
of 
the 
men 
in 
the 
Russian 
army 
were 
then 
in
love, 
though 
less 
ecstatically, 
with 
their 
Tsar 
and 
the 
glory 
of 
the
Russian 
arms.





CHAPTER 
XI

The 
next 
day 
the 
Emperor 
stopped 
at 
Wischau, 
and 
Villier, 
his 
physician,
was 
repeatedly 
summoned 
to 
see 
him. 
At 
headquarters 
and 
among 
the 
troops
near 
by 
the 
news 
spread 
that 
the 
Emperor 
was 
unwell. 
He 
ate 
nothing 
and
had 
slept 
badly 
that 
night, 
those 
around 
him 
reported. 
The 
cause 
of 
this
indisposition 
was 
the 
strong 
impression 
made 
on 
his 
sensitive 
mind 
by
the 
sight 
of 
the 
killed 
and 
wounded.

At 
daybreak 
on 
the 
seventeenth, 
a 
French 
officer 
who 
had 
come 
with
a 
flag 
of 
truce, 
demanding 
an 
audience 
with 
the 
Russian 
Emperor, 
was
brought 
into 
Wischau 
from 
our 
outposts. 
This 
officer 
was 
Savary. 
The
Emperor 
had 
only 
just 
fallen<p>
asleep 
and 
so 
Savary 
had 
to 
wait. 
At 
midday
he 
was 
admitted 
to 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
an 
hour 
later 
he 
rode 
off 
with
Prince 
Dolgorukov 
to 
the 
advanced 
post 
of 
the 
French 
army.

It 
was 
rumored 
that 
Savary 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
propose 
to 
Alexander
a 
meeting 
with 
Napoleon. 
To 
the 
joy 
and 
pride 
of 
the 
whole 
army, 
a
personal 
interview 
was 
refused, 
and 
instead 
of 
the 
Sovereign, 
Prince
Dolgorukov, 
the 
victor 
at 
Wischau, 
was 
sent 
with 
Savary 
to 
negotiate
with 
Napoleon 
if, 
contrary

and</h1>he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
bullets
whistling, 
singing, 
and 
hissing 
continually 
around 
them. 
He 
spoke 
in 
the
tone 
of 
entreaty 
and 
reproach 
that 
a 
carpenter 
uses 
to 
a 
gentleman 
who
has 
picked 
up 
an 
ax: 
"We 
are 
used 
to 
it, 
but 
you, 
sir, 
will 
blister
your 
hands." 
He 
spoke 
as 
if 
those 
bullets 
could 
not 
kill 
him, 
and 
his
half-closed 
eyes 
gave 
still 
more 
persuasiveness 
to 
his 
words. 
The 
staff
officer 
joined 
in 
the 
colonel's 
appeals, 
but 
Bagration 
did 
not 
reply;
he 
only 
gave 
an 
order 
to 
cease 
firing 
and 
re-form, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
room
for 
the 
two 
approaching 
battalions. 
While 
he 
was 
speaking, 
the 
curtain
of 
smoke 
that 
had 
concealed 
the 
hollow, 
driven 
by 
a 
rising 
wind, 
began
to 
move 
from 
right 
to 
left 
as 
if 
drawn 
by 
an 
invisible 
hand, 
and 
the
hill 
opposite, 
with 
the 
French 
moving 
about 
on 
it, 
opened 
out 
before
them. 
All 
eyes 
fastened 
involuntarily 
on 
this 
French 
column 
advancing
against 
them 
and 
winding 
down 
over 
the 
uneven 
ground. 
One 
could 
already
see 
the 
soldiers' 
shaggy 
caps, 
distinguish 
the 
officers 
from 
the 
men,
and 
see 
the 
standard 
flapping 
against 
its 
staff.

"They 
march 
splendidly," 
remarked 
someone 
in 
Bagration's 
suite.

The 
head 
of 
the 
column 
had 
already 
descended 
into 
the 
hollow. 
The 
clash
would 
take 
place 
on 
this 
side 
of 
it...

The 
remains 
of 
our 
regiment 
which 
had 
been 
in 
action 
rapidly 
formed 
up
and 
moved 
to 
the 
right; 
from 
behind 
it, 
dispersing 
the 
laggards, 
came
two 
battalions 
of 
the 
Sixth 
Chasseurs 
in 
fine 
order. 
Before 
they 
had
reached 
Bagration, 
the 
weighty 
tread 
of 
the 
mass 
of 
men 
marching 
in
step 
could 
be 
heard. 
On 
their 
left 
flank, 
nearest 
to 
Bagration, 
marched
a 
company 
commander, 
a 
fine 
round-faced 
man, 
with 
a 
stupid 
and 
happy
expression-the 
same 
man 
who 
had 
rushed 
out 
of 
the 
wattle 
shed. 
At 
that
moment 
he 
was 
clearly 
thinking 
of 
nothing 
but 
how 
dashing 
a 
fellow 
he
would 
appear 
as 
he 
passed 
the 
commander.

With 
the 
self-satisfaction 
of 
a 
man 
on 
parade, 
he 
stepped 
lightly 
with
his 
muscular 
legs 
as 
if 
sailing 
along, 
stretching 
himself 
to 
his 
full
height 
without 
the 
smallest 
effort, 
his 
ease 
contrasting 
with 
the 
heavy
tread 
of 
the 
soldiers 
who 
were 
keeping 
step 
with 
him. 
He 
carried 
close
to 
his 
leg 
a 
narrow 
unsheathed 
sword 
(small, 
curved, 
and 
not 
like 
a 
real
weapon) 
and 
looked 
now 
at

a

went 
up 
to 
her 
and 
began

arms 
about.

First 
the

in 
the 
tight 
trousers 
sang 
alone, 
then 
she 
sang, 
then 
they
both 
paused 
while 
the 
orchestra 
played 
and 
the 
man 
fingered 
the 
hand
of 
the 
girl 
in 
white, 
obviously 
awaiting 
the 
beat 
to 
start 
singing 
with
her. 
They 
sang 
together 
and 
everyone 
in 
the 
theater 
began 
clapping
and 
shouting, 
while 
the 
man 
and 
woman 
on 
the 
stage-who 
represented
lovers-began 
smiling, 
spreading 
out 
their 
arms, 
and 
bowing.

After 
her 
life 
in 
the 
country, 
and 
in

Natasha. 
She 
could 
not

even

she 
saw 
only 
the

the
queerly 
dressed 
men 
and 
women 
who 
moved, 
spoke, 
and 
sang 
so 
strangely 
in
that 
brilliant

She 
knew

it 
was

it 
was 
<a href="/cZl/CK3YIp8qRU2.html">so</a>

false

that 
she

amused

still 
went 
into

the 
habits 
and
acquaintances 
he 
had 
made 
in 
Moscow 
formed 
a 
current 
that 
bore 
him 
along
irresistibly. 
But 
latterly, 
when 
more 
and 
more 
disquieting 
reports 
came
from 
the 
seat 
of 
war

careful 
pity, 
an
ever-increasing 
restlessness, 
which 
he 
could 
not

took
possession 
of 
him. 
He 
felt 
that

that

St.

the

is 
Six

threescore 
and 
six.

And 
in

verse 
of 
the

chapter:

And 
there 
was 
given 
unto 
him 
a 
mouth 
speaking 
great 
things 
and
blasphemies; 
and

was

If 
a

he 
should

in 
regulation 
uniform 
like 
the
others."

"Your 
excellency, 
you 
gave 
him 
leave 
yourself, 
on 
the 
march."

"Gave 
him 
leave? 
Leave? 
That's 
just 
like 
you 
young 
men," 
said<p>
the
regimental 
commander 
cooling 
down 
a 
little. 
"Leave 
indeed.... 
One 
says
a 
word 
to 
you 
and 
you... 
What?" 
he 
added 
with 
renewed 
irritation, 
"I
beg 
you 
to 
dress 
your 
men 
decently."

And 
the 
commander, 
turning 
to 
look 
at 
the 
adjutant, 
directed 
his 
jerky
steps 
down 
the 
line. 
He 
was 
evidently 
pleased 
at 
his 
own 
display 
of
anger 
and 
walking 
up 
to 
the 
regiment 
wished 
to 
find 
a 
further 
excuse 
for
wrath. 
Having 
snapped 
at 
an 
officer 
for 
an 
unpolished 
badge, 
at 
another
because 
his 
line 
was 
not 
straight, 
he 
reached 
the 
third 
company.

"H-o-o-w 
are 
you 
standing? 
Where's 
your 
leg? 
Your 
leg?" 
shouted
the 
commander 
with 
a 
tone 
of 
suffering 
in 
his 
voice, 
while 
there 
were
still 
five 
men 
between 
him 
and 
Dolokhov 
with 
his 
bluish-gray 
uniform.

Dolokhov 
slowly 
straightened 
his 
bent 
knee, 
looking 
straight 
with 
his
clear, 
insolent 
eyes 
in 
the 
general's 
face.

"Why 
a 
blue 
coat? 
Off 
with 
it... 
Sergeant 
major! 
Change 
his 
coat...
the 
ras..." 
he 
did 
not 
finish.

"General, 
I 
must 
obey 
orders, 
but 
I 
am 
not 
bound 
to 
endure..."
Dolokhov 
hurriedly 
interrupted.

"No 
talking 
in 
the 
ranks!... 
No 
talking, 
no 
talking!"

"Not 
bound 
to 
endure 
insults," 
Dolokhov 
concluded 
in 
loud, 
ringing
tones.

The 
eyes 
of 
the 
general 
and 
the 
soldier 
met. 
The 
general 
became 
silent,
angrily 
pulling 
down 
his 
tight 
scarf.

"I 
request 
you 
to 
have 
the 
goodness 
to 
change 
your 
coat," 
he 
said 
as
he 
turned 
away.





CHAPTER 
II

"He's 
coming!" 
shouted 
the 
signaler 
at 
that 
moment.

The 
regimental 
commander, 
flushing, 
ran 
to 
his 
horse, 
seized 
the 
stirrup
with 
trembling 
hands, 
threw 
his 
body 
across 
the 
saddle, 
righted 
himself,
drew 
his 
saber, 
and 
with 
a<p>
happy 
and 
resolute 
countenance, 
opening
his 
mouth 
awry, 
prepared 
to 
shout. 
The 
regiment 
fluttered 
like 
a 
bird
preening 
its 
plumage 
and<p>
became 
motionless.

"Att-ention!" 
shouted 
the 
regimental 
commander 
in 
a 
soul-shaking
voice 
which 
expressed 
joy 
for 
himself, 
severity 
for 
the 
regiment, 
and
welcome 
for 
the 
approaching 
chief.

Along 
the 
broad 
country 
road, 
edged 
on 
both 
sides 
by 
trees, 
came 
a 
high,
light 
blue 
Viennese 
caleche, 
slightly 
creaking 
on 
its 
springs 
and 
drawn
by 
six 
horses 
at 
a 
smart 
trot. 
Behind 
the 
caleche 
galloped 
the 
suite
and 
a 
convoy 
of 
Croats. 
Beside 
Kutuzov 
sat 
an 
Austrian 
general, 
in
a 
white 
uniform 
that 
looked 
strange 
among 
the 
Russian 
black 
ones. 
The
caleche 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
the 
regiment. 
Kutuzov 
and 
the 
Austrian
general 
were 
talking 
in 
low 
voices 
and 
Kutuzov 
smiled 
slightly 
as
treading 
heavily 
he 
stepped 
down 
from 
the 
carriage 
just 
as 
if 
those 
two
thousand 
men 
breathlessly 
gazing 
at 
him 
and 
the 
regimental 
commander 
did
not 
exist.

The<p>
word 
of 
command 
rang 
out, 
and 
again 
the 
regiment 
quivered, 
as 
with 
a
jingling 
sound 
it 
presented 
arms. 
Then 
amidst 
a 
dead 
silence 
the
feeble 
voice 
of 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
was 
heard.<p>
The 
regiment 
roared,
"Health 
to 
your 
ex... 
len... 
len... 
lency!" 
and 
again 
all<p>
became
silent. 
At 
first 
Kutuzov 
stood 
still 
while 
the 
regiment 
moved; 
then 
he
and 
the 
general 
in 
white, 
accompanied 
by 
the 
suite, 
walked 
between 
the
ranks.

From 
the 
way 
the 
regimental 
commander 
saluted 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
and
devoured 
him 
with 
his 
eyes, 
drawing 
himself 
up 
obsequiously, 
and 
from
the 
way 
he 
walked 
through 
the 
ranks

said 
the 
countess,
not 
realizing 
to 
whom 
she

Her 
maternal 
instinct 
told 
her
that 
Natasha 
had 
too 
much 
of 
something, 
and 
that 
because 
of 
this
she 
would 
not 
be 
happy. 
Before 
Natasha 
had 
finished 
singing,
fourteen-year-old 
Petya 
rushed 
in 
delightedly, 
to 
say 
that 
some 
mummers
had 
arrived.

Natasha 
stopped 
abruptly.

"Idiot!" 
she 
screamed 
at 
her 
brother 
and, 
running 
to 
a 
chair, 
threw
herself 
on 
it, 
sobbing 
so 
violently 
that 
she 
could 
not 
stop 
for 
a 
long
time.

"It's 
nothing, 
Mamma, 
really 
it's 
nothing; 
only 
Petya 
startled
me," 
she 
said, 
trying 
to 
smile, 
but 
her 
tears 
still 
flowed 
and 
sobs
still 
choked 
her.

The 
mummers 
(some 
of 
the 
house 
serfs) 
dressed 
up 
as 
bears, 
Turks,
innkeepers, 
and 
ladies-frightening 
and 
funny-bringing 
in 
with
them 
the 
cold 
from 
outside 
and 
a 
feeling 
of 
gaiety, 
crowded, 
at 
first
timidly, 
into 
the

then 
hiding

into

shyly 
at

then 
more 
and 
more 
merrily
and 
heartily, 
they 
started 
singing, 
dancing, 
and 
playing 
Christmas
games. 
The 
countess, 
when 
she 
had 
identified 
them 
and 
laughed 
at 
their

went 
into 
the

Half

an

A

An

was 
Natasha,

a
Circassian 
was 
Sonya 
with 
burnt-cork

After

the

began 
unexpectedly 
to 
talk 
about 
Princess 
Mary, 
blaming 
her 
for 
her
superstitions 
and 
her 
dislike 
of 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
who, 
he 
said,
was 
the 
only 
person 
really 
attached 
to 
him.

The 
old 
prince 
said 
that 
if

ill 
it 
was 
only 
because<p>
of 
Princess
Mary: 
that 
she 
purposely 
worried

irritated 
him, 
and 
that 
by
indulgence 
and 
silly 
talk 
she 
was 
spoiling 
little 
Prince 
Nicholas. 
The
old 
prince 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
he 
tormented 
his 
daughter 
and 
that 
her
life 
was 
very 
hard, 
but 
he 
also 
knew 
that 
he 
could 
not 
help 
tormenting
her 
and 
that 
she 
deserved 
it. 
"Why 
does 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
sees 
this,
say 
nothing 
to 
me 
about 
his

Does 
he

a

an

thought 
the

And 
he 
began 
explaining 
why 
he 
could 
not 
put 
up 
with 
his 
daughter's
unreasonable 
character.

"If

ask

said 
Prince

without 
looking 
up 
(he 
was
censuring

"I

The

at

fixedly 
at

and<p>
an 
unnatural 
smile
disclosed 
the 
fresh

between 
his

to

Prince

"What

Eh?"

"Father,

Prince

in 
a 
hard

am 
I 
to 
go?" 
thought 
Nicholas, 
and 
went 
again 
into 
the 
dancing 
room
where 
the 
clavichord 
stood.

Sonya 
was 
sitting 
at 
the 
clavichord, 
playing 
the 
prelude 
to
Denisov's 
favorite 
barcarolle. 
Natasha 
was 
preparing 
to 
sing.
Denisov 
was 
looking 
at 
her 
with 
enraptured 
eyes.

Nicholas 
began 
pacing 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room.

"Why 
do 
they 
want 
to 
make 
her 
sing? 
How 
can 
she 
sing? 
There's
nothing 
to 
be 
happy 
about!" 
thought 
he.

Sonya 
struck 
the 
first 
chord 
of 
the 
prelude.

"My 
God, 
I'm 
a 
ruined 
and 
dishonored 
man! 
A 
bullet 
through 
my 
brain
is 
the 
only 
thing 
left 
me-not 
singing!" 
his 
thoughts 
ran 
on. 
"Go
away?<p>
But 
where 
to? 
It's 
one-let 
them 
sing!"

He 
continued 
to 
pace 
the 
room, 
looking<p>
gloomily 
at 
Denisov 
and 
the
girls 
and 
avoiding 
their 
eyes.

"Nikolenka, 
what 
is 
the 
matter?" 
Sonya's 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
him
seemed 
to 
ask. 
She 
noticed 
at 
once 
that 
something 
had 
happened 
to 
him.

Nicholas 
turned 
away 
from 
her. 
Natasha 
too, 
with 
her 
quick 
instinct,
had 
instantly 
noticed 
her 
brother's 
condition. 
But, 
though 
she 
noticed
it, 
she 
was 
herself 
in 
such 
high 
spirits 
at 
that 
moment, 
so 
far 
from
sorrow, 
sadness, 
or 
self-reproach, 
that 
she 
purposely 
deceived 
herself
as 
young 
people 
often 
do. 
"No, 
I 
am 
too 
happy 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mo7tQp0LQJK.html">now</a> 
to 
spoil 
my
enjoyment 
by 
sympathy 
with 
anyone's 
sorrow," 
she 
felt, 
and 
she 
said
to 
herself: 
"No, 
I 
must 
be 
mistaken, 
he 
must 
be 
feeling 
happy, 
just 
as
I 
am."

"Now, 
Sonya!"<p>
she 
said, 
going 
to 
the 
very 
middle 
of 
the 
room, 
where
she 
considered 
the 
resonance 
was 
best.

Having 
lifted 
her 
head 
and 
let 
her 
arms 
droop 
lifelessly, 
as 
ballet
dancers 
do, 
Natasha, 
rising 
energetically 
from 
her 
heels 
to 
her 
toes,
stepped 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
and 
stood 
still.

"Yes, 
that's 
me!" 
she 
seemed 
to 
say,<p>
answering 
the 
rapt 
gaze 
with
which 
Denisov 
followed 
her.

"And 
what 
is 
she 
so 
pleased 
about?" 
thought 
Nicholas, 
looking 
at 
his
sister.

CHAPTER 
IX

The 
Fifth 
company 
was 
bivouacking 
at 
the 
very 
edge 
of 
the 
forest. 
A 
huge
campfire 
was 
blazing 
brightly 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
snow, 
lighting 
up 
the
branches 
of 
trees 
heavy 
with 
hoarfrost.

About 
midnight 
they 
heard 
the 
sound 
of 
steps 
in 
the 
snow 
of 
the 
forest,
and 
the 
crackling 
of 
dry 
branches.

"A 
bear, 
lads," 
said 
one 
of 
the 
men.

They 
all 
raised 
their 
heads 
to 
listen, 
and<p>
out 
of 
the 
forest 
into 
the
bright 
firelight 
stepped 
two 
strangely 
clad 
human 
figures 
clinging 
to
one 
another.

These 
were 
<a href="/aVzUge/Hqk4G5DduKC9ven.html">two</a> 
Frenchmen 
who 
<a href="/aVzUge/hfW2t0f7UKBi.html">had</a> 
been 
hiding 
in 
the 
forest. 
They 
came 
up
to 
the 
fire, 
hoarsely 
uttering 
something 
in 
a 
language 
our 
soldiers 
did
not 
understand. 
One 
was 
taller 
than 
the 
other; 
he 
wore 
an 
officer's 
hat
and 
seemed<p>
quite 
exhausted.

approaching 
the

he 
had

The 
other, 
a 
short 
sturdy 
soldier 
with 
a 
shawl
tied 
round 
his 
head, 
was 
stronger. 
He 
raised 
his 
companion 
and 
said
something, 
pointing 
to 
his 
mouth. 
The 
soldiers 
surrounded

To

At

she 
heard 
only 
Metivier's 
voice, 
then 
her 
father's, 
then
both 
voices 
began 
speaking

the

the 
door 
was 
flung 
open,
and 
on 
the 
threshold 
appeared 
the 
handsome 
figure 
of 
the 
terrified
Metivier 
with 
his 
shock 
of 
black 
hair, 
and 
the 
prince 
in 
his 
dressing
gown 
and 
fez, 
his 
face 
distorted 
with 
fury 
and 
the 
pupils 
of 
his 
eyes
rolled 
downwards.

"You 
don't 
understand?" 
shouted 
the 
prince, 
"but 
I 
do! 
French
spy, 
slave 
of 
Buonaparte, 
spy,

out 
of 
my

Be 
off, 
I 
tell
you..." 
and 
he 
slammed 
the 
door.

Metivier, 
shrugging 
his 
shoulders, 
went 
up 
to 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne
who 
at 
the 
sound 
of 
shouting 
had<p>
run 
in 
from 
an 
adjoining 
room.

"The 
prince 
is 
not 
very 
well: 
bile 
and 
rush 
of 
blood 
to 
the 
head. 
Keep
calm, 
I 
will 
call 
again 
tomorrow," 
said 
Metivier; 
and 
putting 
his
fingers 
to 
his 
lips 
he 
hastened 
away.

Through 
the 
study 
door 
came 
the 
sound 
of<p>
slippered 
feet 
and 
the 
cry:
"Spies, 
traitors, 
traitors 
everywhere! 
Not 
a 
moment's 
peace 
in 
my
own 
house!"

After 
Metivier's 
departure 
the 
old 
prince 
called 
his 
daughter 
in, 
and
the 
whole 
weight 
of 
his 
wrath 
fell 
on 
her. 
She 
was 
to 
blame 
that 
a 
spy
had 
been 
admitted. 
Had 
he 
not 
told 
her, 
yes, 
told 
her 
to 
make 
a 
list,
and 
not 
to 
admit 
anyone 
who 
was 
not 
on 
that 
list? 
Then 
why 
was 
that
scoundrel 
admitted? 
She 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
it 
all. 
<a href="/cZl/nr9b2U5YysHj.html">With</a> 
her, 
he 
said, 
he

the 
course

"Our

"And

a

was

a

song
in

hoarse 
broken 
voice, 
with

thrown

The

For

"It

Well, 
now, 
Zaletaev!"

"Ke..." 
Zaletaev, 
brought 
out 
with 
effort: 
"ke-e-e-e," 
he 
drawled,
laboriously 
pursing 
his 
lips, 
"le-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba,

he 
sang.

"Fine! 
Just 
like 
the 
Frenchie! 
Oh, 
ho 
ho! 
Do 
you 
want 
some 
more 
to 
eat?"

"Give 
him 
some 
porridge: 
it 
takes 
a 
long 
time 
to 
get 
filled 
up 
after
starving."

They 
gave 
him 
some 
more 
porridge 
and 
Morel 
with 
a 
laugh 
set 
to 
work 
on
his 
third 
bowl. 
All 
the 
young 
soldiers 
smiled 
gaily 
as 
they 
watched 
him.
The 
older 
men, 
who 
thought 
it 
undignified 
to 
amuse 
themselves 
with 
such
nonsense, 
continued 
to 
lie 
at 
the 
opposite 
side 
of 
the 
fire, 
but 
one
would 
occasionally 
raise 
himself 
on 
an 
elbow 
and 
glance 
at 
Morel 
with 
a
smile.

"They 
are 
men 
too," 
said 
one 
of 
them 
as 
he 
wrapped 
himself 
up 
in 
his
coat. 
"Even 
wormwood 
grows 
on 
its 
own 
root."

"O 
Lord, 
O 
Lord! 
How 
starry 
it 
is! 
Tremendous! 
That 
means 
a 
hard
frost...."

They 
all 
grew 
silent. 
The 
stars, 
as 
if 
knowing 
that 
no 
one 
was 
looking
at 
them, 
began 
to 
disport 
themselves 
in 
the 
dark 
sky: 
now 
flaring
up, 
now 
vanishing, 
now 
trembling, 
they 
were 
busy 
whispering 
something
gladsome 
and 
mysterious 
to 
one 
another.





CHAPTER 
X

The 
French 
army 
melted 
away<p>
at 
the 
uniform 
rate 
of 
a 
mathematical
progression; 
and 
that 
crossing 
of 
the 
Berezina 
about 
which 
so 
much 
has
been 
written 
was 
only 
one 
intermediate 
stage 
in 
its 
destruction, 
and
not 
at 
all 
the 
decisive 
episode 
of 
the 
campaign. 
If 
so 
much 
has 
been
and 
still 
is 
written 
about 
the 
Berezina, 
on 
the 
French 
side 
this 
is 
only
because 
at 
the 
broken 
bridge 
across 
that 
river 
the 
calamities 
their 
army
had 
been 
previously 
enduring 
were 
suddenly 
concentrated 
at 
one 
moment
into 
a 
tragic 
spectacle 
that 
remained 
in 
every 
memory, 
and 
on 
the
Russian 
side 
merely 
because 
in 
Petersburg-far 
from 
the 
seat 
of 
war-a
plan 
(again 
one 
of 
Pfuel's) 
had<p>
been 
devised 
to 
catch 
Napoleon 
in 
a
strategic<p>
trap 
at 
the 
Berezina 
River. 
Everyone 
assured 
himself 
that 
all
would 
happen 
according 
to 
plan, 
and 
therefore 
insisted 
that 
it 
was 
just
the 
crossing 
of 
the 
Berezina 
that 
destroyed 
the 
French 
army. 
In 
reality
the 
results 
of 
the 
crossing 
were 
much 
less 
disastrous 
to 
the 
French-in
guns 
and 
men 
lost-than 
Krasnoe 
had 
been, 
as 
the 
figures 
show.

The 
sole 
importance 
of 
the 
crossing 
of 
the 
Berezina 
lies 
in 
the 
fact
that 
it 
plainly 
and 
indubitably 
proved 
the 
fallacy 
of 
all

His

Coming

ran 
beside

"Thrice

he 
cried, 
raising 
his

higher 
and 
higher.

Count 
Rostopchin 
suddenly 
grew 
pale 
as 
he 
had 
done 
when 
the 
crowd 
closed
in 
on 
Vereshchagin. 
He 
turned 
away. 
"Go

<a href="/aVzUge/YE7mbEd9f4tHLaX.html">he</a> 
cried 
in 
a

Prince 
Andrew 
knew 
how 
to 
take</h1>his 
stand 
so 
that 
they 
respected 
and 
even
feared 
him.

Coming 
out 
of 
Kutuzov's 
room 
into 
the 
waiting 
room 
with 
the 
papers 
in
his 
hand 
Prince 
Andrew 
came 
up 
to 
his 
comrade, 
the 
aide-de-camp 
on 
duty,
Kozlovski, 
who 
was 
sitting 
at 
the 
window<p>
with 
a 
book.

"Well, 
Prince?" 
asked 
Kozlovski.

"I 
am 
ordered 
to 
write 
a 
memorandum 
explaining 
why 
we 
are 
not
advancing."

"And 
why 
is 
it?"

Prince 
Andrew 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders.

"Any 
news 
from 
Mack?"

"No."

"If 
it 
were 
true 
that<p>
he 
has 
been 
beaten, 
news 
would 
have 
come."

"Probably," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
moving 
toward 
the 
outer 
door.

But 
at 
that 
instant 
a 
tall 
Austrian 
general 
in 
a 
greatcoat, 
with 
the
order 
of 
Maria 
Theresa 
on 
his 
neck 
and 
a 
black 
bandage 
round 
his 
head,
who 
had 
evidently 
just 
arrived, 
entered 
quickly, 
slamming 
the 
door.
Prince 
Andrew 
stopped 
short.

"Commander 
in 
Chief 
Kutuzov?" 
said 
the 
newly 
arrived 
general
speaking 
quickly 
with 
a 
harsh 
German 
accent, 
looking 
to 
both 
sides 
and
advancing 
straight 
toward 
the 
inner 
door.

"The 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
engaged," 
said 
Kozlovski, 
going
hurriedly 
up 
to 
the 
unknown 
general 
and 
blocking 
his 
way 
to 
the 
door.
"Whom 
shall 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/MjR1AXsTm93eI.html">I</a> 
announce?"

The 
unknown 
general 
looked<p>
disdainfully 
down 
at 
Kozlovski, 
who 
was
rather 
short, 
as 
if 
surprised 
that 
anyone 
should 
not 
know 
him.

"The 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
engaged," 
repeated 
Kozlovski 
calmly.

The 
general's 
face 
clouded, 
his 
lips 
quivered 
and 
trembled. 
He 
took
out 
a 
notebook, 
hurriedly 
scribbled 
something 
in 
pencil, 
tore 
out<p>
the
leaf, 
gave 
it 
to 
Kozlovski, 
stepped 
quickly 
to 
the 
window, 
and 
threw
himself 
into 
a 
chair, 
gazing 
at 
those 
in 
the 
room 
as 
if 
asking, 
"Why
do 
they 
look 
at 
me?" 
Then 
he 
lifted 
his 
head, 
stretched 
his 
neck 
as
if 
he 
intended 
to 
say 
something, 
but 
immediately, 
with 
affected
indifference, 
began 
to 
hum 
to 
himself, 
producing 
a 
queer 
sound 
which
immediately 
broke 
off. 
The 
door 
of 
the 
private 
room 
opened 
and 
Kutuzov
appeared 
in 
the 
doorway. 
The 
general 
with 
the 
bandaged 
head 
bent 
forward
as 
though 
running 
away 
from 
some 
danger, 
and, 
making 
long, 
quick 
strides
with 
his 
thin 
legs, 
went 
up 
to 
Kutuzov.

"Vous 
voyez 
le 
malheureux 
Mack," 
he 
uttered 
in 
a 
broken 
voice.

Kutuzov's 
face 
as 
he 
stood 
in 
the 
open 
doorway 
remained 
perfectly
immobile 
for 
a<p>
few 
moments. 
Then 
wrinkles 
ran 
over 
his 
face 
like 
a 
wave
and 
his 
forehead 
became 
smooth 
again, 
he 
bowed 
his 
head 
respectfully,
closed 
his 
eyes, 
silently 
let 
Mack 
enter 
his 
room 
before 
him, 
and 
closed
the 
door 
himself 
behind 
him.

The 
report 
which 
had 
been 
circulated 
that 
the 
Austrians 
had 
been 
beaten
and 
that 
the 
whole 
army 
had 
surrendered 
at 
Ulm 
proved 
to 
be 
correct.
Within 
half 
an 
hour 
adjutants 
had 
been 
sent 
in 
various 
directions 
with
orders 
which 
showed 
that 
the 
Russian 
troops, 
who 
had 
hitherto 
been
inactive, 
would 
also 
soon 
have 
to 
meet 
the 
enemy.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
one 
of 
those 
rare 
staff 
officers 
whose 
chief 
interest
lay 
in 
the 
general 
progress 
of 
the 
war. 
When 
he 
saw 
Mack 
and 
heard 
the
details 
of 
his 
disaster<p>
he 
understood 
that 
half 
the 
campaign 
was 
lost,
understood 
all 
the 
difficulties 
of 
the 
Russian 
army's 
position, 
and
vividly 
imagined 
what 
awaited 
it 
and 
the 
part 
he 
would 
have 
to
play. 
Involuntarily 
he 
felt 
a 
joyful 
agitation 
at 
the 
thought 
of 
the
humiliation 
of 
arrogant 
Austria 
and 
that 
in 
a 
week's 
time 
he 
might,
perhaps, 
see 
and 
take 
part 
in 
the 
first 
Russian 
encounter 
with 
the
French 
since 
Suvorov 
met 
them. 
He 
feared 
that 
Bonaparte's 
genius
might 
outweigh 
all 
the 
courage 
of 
the 
Russian 
troops, 
and 
at 
the 
same
time 
could 
not 
admit 
the 
idea 
of 
his 
hero 
being 
disgraced.

Excited 
and 
irritated 
by 
these 
thoughts 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
toward 
his
room 
to 
write 
to 
his 
father, 
to 
whom

those
prompted

vanity

pettiness.

Finding 
himself 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Napoleon, 
whose 
identity 
he 
had 
easily
and 
surely 
recognized, 
Lavrushka 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
abashed 
but 
merely
did 
his 
utmost 
to 
gain 
his 
new 
master's 
favor.

He 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
this 
was 
Napoleon, 
but 
Napoleon's 
presence 
could
no 
more 
intimidate 
him 
than 
Rostov's, 
or 
a 
sergeant 
major's 
with 
the
rods, 
would 
have 
done, 
for 
he 
had 
nothing 
that 
either 
the 
sergeant 
major
or 
Napoleon 
could 
deprive 
him 
of.

So 
he 
rattled 
on, 
telling 
all 
the 
gossip 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EJ4KpkPN7d0P.html">he</a> 
had 
heard 
among 
the
orderlies. 
Much 
of 
it 
true. 
But 
when 
Napoleon 
asked 
him 
whether 
the
Russians 
thought 
they 
would 
beat 
Bonaparte 
or 
not, 
Lavrushka 
screwed 
up
his 
eyes 
and 
considered.

In 
this 
question 
he 
saw 
subtle 
cunning, 
as 
men 
of 
his 
type 
see 
cunning
in 
everything, 
so 
he 
frowned<p>
and 
did 
not 
answer 
immediately.

"It's 
like 
this," 
he 
said 
thoughtfully, 
"if 
there's 
a 
battle 
soon, 
yours
will 
win. 
That's 
right. 
But 
if 
three 
days 
pass, 
then 
after 
that, 
well,
then 
that 
same 
battle 
will 
not 
soon 
be 
over."

Lelorgne 
d'Ideville 
smilingly 
interpreted 
this 
speech 
to 
Napoleon 
thus:
"If 
a 
battle 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
next 
three 
days 
the 
French 
will
win, 
but 
if 
later, 
God 
knows 
what 
will 
happen." 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
smile,
though 
he 
was 
evidently 
in 
high 
good 
humor, 
and 
he 
ordered 
these 
words
to 
be 
repeated.

Lavrushka 
noticed 
this 
and 
to 
entertain 
him 
further, 
pretending 
not 
to
know 
who 
Napoleon 
was, 
added:

"We 
know 
that 
you 
have 
Bonaparte 
and 
that 
he 
has 
beaten 
everybody 
in 
the
world, 
but 
we 
are 
a 
different 
matter..."-without 
knowing 
why 
or 
how 
this
bit 
of 
boastful 
patriotism 
slipped 
out 
at 
the 
end.

The 
interpreter 
translated 
these 
words 
without 
the 
last 
phrase, 
and
Bonaparte 
smiled. 
"The 
young 
Cossack 
made 
his 
mighty 
interlocutor
smile," 
says 
Thiers. 
After 
riding 
a 
few 
paces 
in 
silence, 
Napoleon
turned 
to 
Berthier 
and 
said 
he 
wished 
to 
see 
how 
the 
news 
that 
he 
was
talking 
to 
the 
Emperor 
himself, 
to 
that 
very 
Emperor 
who 
had 
written 
his
immortally 
victorious 
name 
on 
the 
Pyramids, 
would 
affect 
this 
enfant 
du
Don. 
*

 
 
 
 
* 
"Child 
of 
the 
Don."


The 
fact 
was 
accordingly 
conveyed 
to 
Lavrushka.

Lavrushka, 
understanding 
that 
this 
was 
done 
to 
perplex 
him 
and 
that
Napoleon 
expected 
him 
to 
be 
frightened, 
to 
gratify<p>
his 
new 
masters
promptly 
pretended 
to 
be 
astonished 
and 
awe-struck, 
opened 
his 
eyes
wide, 
and 
assumed 
the 
expression 
he 
usually 
put 
on 
when 
taken

"As

also 
from 
that 
feeling 
which, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him, 
he 
had
aroused 
in 
himself.

On 
the 
third 
day 
after 
his 
arrival 
he 
heard 
from 
the 
Drubetskoys 
that
Princess 
Mary 
was 
in 
Moscow. 
The 
death, 
sufferings, 
and 
last 
days 
of
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
often 
occupied 
Pierre's 
thoughts 
and 
now 
recurred 
to
him 
with 
fresh 
vividness. 
Having 
heard 
at 
dinner 
that 
Princess 
Mary
was 
in 
Moscow 
and 
living 
in 
her 
house-which 
had 
not 
been 
burned-in
Vozdvizhenka 
Street, 
he 
drove 
that 
same 
evening 
to 
see 
her.

On 
his 
way 
to 
the 
house 
Pierre 
kept 
thinking 
of 
Prince 
Andrew, 
of 
their
friendship, 
of 
his 
various 
meetings 
with 
him, 
and 
especially 
of 
the 
last
one 
at 
Borodino.

"Is

Pierre. 
He 
recalled 
Karataev 
and 
his 
death 
and
involuntarily 
began 
to 
compare 
these 
two 
men, 
so 
different, 
and 
yet 
so
similar 
in 
that 
they

After

when 
the

cried
the

"And

screamed 
in

addressing 
Princess 
Mary 
for 
the 
first 
time, 
"to

Go! 
Don't

Princess

Mademoiselle

also 
her
father's 
pardon 
for 
herself

for 
Philip 
the

At 
such

something

pride

in 
her

suddenly 
that

would 
look 
for

fumbling

CHAPTER 
III

In 
1811<p>
there 
was 
living 
in 
Moscow 
a 
French 
doctor-Metivier-who 
had
rapidly 
become 
the 
fashion. 
He 
was 
enormously 
tall, 
handsome, 
amiable
as 
Frenchmen 
are, 
and 
was, 
as 
all 
Moscow 
said, 
an 
extraordinarily 
clever
doctor. 
He 
was 
received 
in 
the 
best 
houses 
not 
merely 
as 
a 
doctor, 
but
as 
an 
equal.

Prince 
Nicholas 
had 
always 
ridiculed 
medicine, 
but 
latterly 
on
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
advice 
had 
allowed 
this 
doctor 
to 
visit 
him
and 
had 
grown 
accustomed 
to 
him. 
Metivier 
came 
to 
see<p>
the 
prince 
about
twice 
a 
week.

On 
December 
6-St. 
Nicholas' 
Day 
and 
the 
prince's 
name

sufferings."

"Karataev!" 
came 
to 
Pierre's 
mind.

And 
suddenly 
he 
saw 
vividly 
before 
him 
a 
long-forgotten, 
kindly 
old 
man
who 
had 
given 
him 
geography 
lessons 
in 
Switzerland. 
"Wait 
a 
bit," 
said
the 
old<p>
man, 
and 
showed 
Pierre 
a 
globe. 
This 
globe 
was 
alive-a 
vibrating
ball 
without 
fixed 
dimensions. 
Its 
whole 
surface 
consisted 
of 
drops
closely 
pressed 
together, 
and 
all 
these 
drops 
moved 
and 
changed 
places,
sometimes 
several 
of 
them 
merging 
into 
one, 
sometimes 
one 
dividing
into 
many. 
Each 
drop 
tried 
to 
spread 
out 
and 
occupy 
as 
much 
space 
as
possible, 
but 
others 
striving 
to 
do 
the 
same 
compressed 
it, 
sometimes
destroyed 
it, 
and 
sometimes 
merged 
with 
it.

"That 
is 
life," 
said 
the 
old 
teacher.

"How 
simple 
and 
clear 
it 
is," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"How 
is 
it 
I 
did 
not 
know
it 
before?"

"God 
is 
in 
the 
midst, 
and 
each 
drop 
tries 
to 
expand 
so 
as 
to 
reflect
Him 
to 
the 
greatest 
extent. 
And 
it 
grows, 
merges, 
disappears 
from 
the
surface, 
sinks 
to 
the 
depths, 
and 
again 
emerges.<p>
There 
now, 
Karataev
has 
spread 
out 
and 
disappeared. 
Do 
you 
understand, 
my 
child?" 
said 
the
teacher.

"Do 
you 
understand, 
damn 
you?" 
shouted 
a 
voice, 
and 
Pierre 
woke 
up.

He 
lifted 
himself 
and 
sat 
up. 
A 
Frenchman 
who 
had 
just 
pushed 
a 
Russian
soldier 
away 
was 
squatting 
by 
the 
fire, 
engaged 
in 
roasting 
a<p>
piece
of 
meat 
stuck 
on 
a 
ramrod. 
His 
sleeves 
were 
rolled 
up 
and 
his 
sinewy,
hairy, 
red 
hands 
with 
their 
short 
fingers 
deftly 
turned 
the 
ramrod. 
His
brown 
morose 
face 
with 
frowning 
brows 
was 
clearly 
visible 
by 
the 
glow 
of
the 
charcoal.

"It's 
all 
the 
same 
to 
him," 
he 
muttered, 
turning 
quickly 
to 
a 
soldier
who 
stood 
behind 
him. 
"Brigand! 
Get 
away!"

And 
twisting 
the 
ramrod 
he 
looked 
gloomily 
at 
Pierre, 
who 
turned
away 
and 
gazed 
into 
the 
darkness. 
A 
prisoner, 
the 
Russian 
soldier 
the
Frenchman 
had 
pushed 
away, 
was 
sitting 
near 
the 
fire 
patting 
something
with 
his 
hand. 
Looking 
more 
closely<p>
Pierre 
recognized 
the 
blue-gray 
dog,
sitting 
beside 
the 
soldier, 
wagging 
its 
tail.

"Ah, 
he's 
come?" 
said 
Pierre. 
"And 
Plat-" 
he 
began, 
but 
did 
not 
finish.

Suddenly 
and 
simultaneously 
a 
crowd 
of<p>
memories 
awoke 
in 
his 
fancy-of
the 
look 
Platon 
had 
given 
him 
as 
he 
sat 
under 
the 
tree, 
of 
the 
shot
heard 
from 
that 
spot, 
of 
the 
dog's 
howl, 
of 
the 
guilty 
faces 
of 
the 
two
Frenchmen 
as 
they 
ran 
past 
him, 
of 
the 
lowered 
and 
smoking 
gun, 
and 
of
Karataev's 
absence 
at 
this 
halt-and 
he 
was 
on 
the 
point 
of 
realizing
that 
<a href="/cZl/Je29s0aAcKW.html">Karataev</a> 
had 
been 
killed, 
but 
just 
at 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/oFc40ZkSv8ErZgX.html">that</a> 
instant, 
he 
knew 
not
why, 
the 
recollection 
came 
to 
his 
mind 
of 
a 
summer 
evening 
he 
had 
spent
with 
a 
beautiful 
Polish 
lady 
on 
the 
veranda 
of 
his 
house 
in 
Kiev. 
And
without 
linking 
up 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day 
or 
drawing 
a 
conclusion
from 
them, 
Pierre 
closed 
his 
eyes, 
seeing 
a 
vision 
of 
the 
country 
in
summertime 
mingled 
with 
memories 
of 
bathing 
and 
of 
the 
liquid, 
vibrating
globe, 
and 
he 
sank 
into 
water 
so 
that 
it 
closed 
over 
his 
head.

Before 
sunrise 
he 
was 
awakened 
by 
shouts 
and 
loud 
and 
rapid 
firing.
French 
soldiers 
were 
running 
past 
him.

"The 
Cossacks!" 
one 
of 
them 
shouted, 
and 
a 
moment 
later 
a 
crowd 
of
Russians 
surrounded 
Pierre.

For 
a 
long 
time 
he 
could 
not 
understand 
what 
was 
happening 
to 
him. 
All
around 
he 
heard 
his 
comrades 
sobbing 
with 
joy.

"Brothers! 
Dear 
fellows! 
Darlings!" 
old 
soldiers 
exclaimed, 
weeping, 
as
they<p>
embraced 
Cossacks 
and 
hussars.

The 
hussars 
and 
Cossacks 
crowded 
round 
the 
prisoners; 
one 
offered 
them
clothes, 
another 
boots, 
and<p>
a 
third 
bread. 
Pierre 
sobbed 
as 
he 
sat
among 
them 
and 
could 
not 
utter 
a 
word. 
He 
hugged 
the 
first 
soldier 
who
approached 
him, 
and 
kissed 
him, 
weeping.

Dolokhov 
stood 
at 
the 
gate 
of 
the 
ruined 
house, 
letting 
a 
crowd
of 
disarmed 
Frenchmen 
pass 
by.

CHAPTER 
XIX

From 
the 
day 
his 
wife 
arrived 
in 
Moscow 
Pierre 
had 
been 
intending 
to 
go
away 
somewhere, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
be 
near 
her. 
Soon 
after 
the 
Rostovs 
came
to 
Moscow 
the 
effect 
Natasha 
had 
on 
him 
made 
him 
hasten 
to 
carry 
out
his 
intention. 
He 
went 
to 
Tver 
to 
see 
<a href="/cZl/gJL59gcnoA4a.html">Joseph</a> 
Alexeevich's 
widow, 
who
had 
long 
since 
promised 
to 
hand 
over 
to 
him 
some 
papers 
of 
her 
deceased
husband's.

When 
he 
returned 
to 
Moscow 
Pierre 
was 
handed 
a 
letter 
from 
Marya
Dmitrievna 
asking 
him 
to 
come 
and 
see 
her 
on 
a 
matter 
of 
great
importance

to 
Andrew 
Bolkonski 
and 
his 
betrothed. 
Pierre 
had
been 
avoiding 
Natasha 
because 
it 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
his 
feeling 
for 
her
was 
stronger 
than 
a 
married 
man's<p>

friend's 
fiancee.
Yet 
some 
fate 
constantly 
threw 
them 
together.

"What 
can 
have 
happened? 
And 
what 
can 
they 
want

me?" 
thought 
he
as 
he 
dressed

go

Marya 
Dmitrievna's. 
"If

Andrew 
would
hurry 
up 
and 
come 
and 
marry 
her!" 
thought 
he 
on 
his 
way 
to 
the 
house.

On 
the 
Tverskoy 
Boulevard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
called 
to 
him.

"Pierre! 
Been 
back 
long?" 
someone 
shouted. 
Pierre 
raised 
his 
head. 
In
a 
sleigh

Anatole

the

they

that 
the

met 
him 
with 
the 
cross 
oppressed 
the 
peasants 
by 
his 
exactions,

that 
the

wept 
at 
having 
to 
let 
him 
take 
their 
children
and 
secured 
their 
release 
by 
heavy 
payments. 
He 
did<p>
not 
know 
that 
the
brick 
buildings, 
built 
to 
plan, 
were 
being 
built 
by 
serfs 
whose 
manorial
labor 
was 
thus 
increased, 
though 
lessened 
on 
paper. 
He 
did 
not 
know
that 
where 
the 
steward 
had 
shown 
him 
in 
the 
accounts 
that 
the 
serfs'
payments 
had 
been 
diminished 
by 
a 
third, 
their 
obligatory 
manorial 
work
had 
been 
increased 
by 
a 
half. 
And 
so 
Pierre 
was 
delighted 
with 
his 
visit
to 
his 
estates 
and 
quite 
recovered 
the 
philanthropic 
mood 
in 
which
he 
had 
left<p>
Petersburg, 
and 
wrote 
enthusiastic 
letters 
to 
his
"brother-instructor" 
as 
he 
called 
the 
Grand 
Master.

"How 
easy 
it 
is, 
how 
little

to 
do 
so

thought 
Pierre, 
"and 
how

we 
pay 
to 
it!"

He 
was 
pleased 
at 
the 
gratitude 
he 
received, 
but 
felt 
abashed 
at
receiving 
it. 
This 
gratitude 
reminded 
him 
of 
how 
much 
more 
he 
might 
do
for 
these 
simple, 
kindly 
people.

The 
chief 
steward, 
a 
very 
stupid 
but 
cunning 
man 
who 
saw 
perfectly
through 
the 
naive 
and 
intelligent 
count 
and 
played 
with 
him 
as 
with
a 
toy, 
seeing 
the 
effect 
these 
prearranged 
receptions 
had 
on 
Pierre,
pressed 
him 
still 
harder 
with 
proofs 
of 
the 
impossibility 
and 
above 
all
the 
uselessness 
of 
freeing 
the 
serfs, 
who 
were 
quite 
happy 
as 
it 
was.

Pierre 
in 
his 
secret 
soul 
agreed 
with 
the 
steward 
that 
it 
would 
be
difficult 
to 
imagine 
happier 
people, 
and 
that<p>
God 
only 
knew 
what 
would
happen 
to 
them 
when 
they 
were 
free, 
but 
he 
insisted, 
though 
reluctantly,
on 
what 
he 
thought 
right. 
The 
steward 
promised 
to 
do 
<a href="/cZl/pS5pWxqu6ct6cV.html">all</a> 
in 
his 
power 
to
carry 
out 
the

clearly 
that

would 
the

CHAPTER 
XI

Returning 
from 
his 
journey 
through 
South 
Russia 
in 
the 
happiest 
state
of 
mind, 
Pierre 
carried 
out 
an 
intention 
he 
had 
long 
had 
of 
visiting 
his
friend 
Bolkonski, 
whom 
he 
had 
not 
seen 
for 
two 
years.

down.

But 
neither 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
nor 
the 
footman 
nor 
the 
coachman, 
who
could 
not 
help 
seeing 
these 
people, 
took 
any 
notice 
of 
them. 
"It 
seems
to 
be 
all 
right," 
Pierre 
concluded, 
and 
followed 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna.
She 
hurriedly 
ascended 
the 
narrow 
dimly 
lit 
stone 
staircase, 
calling 
to
Pierre, 
who 
was 
lagging 
behind, 
to 
follow. 
Though 
he 
<a href="/aVzUge/WC6zmeD7cYy0.html">did</a> 
not 
see 
why 
it
was 
necessary 
for 
him

still 
less 
why<p>
he 
had

yet 
judging 
by 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
air
of 
assurance 
and 
haste, 
Pierre 
concluded 
that 
it 
was 
all 
absolutely
necessary. 
Halfway 
up<p>
the 
stairs 
they 
were 
almost 
knocked 
over 
by
some 
men 
who, 
carrying 
pails, 
came 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vh5UTE21.html">running</a> 
downstairs, 
their 
boots
clattering. 
These 
men 
pressed 
close 
to 
the 
wall 
to 
let 
Pierre 
and 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
pass 
and 
did 
not 
evince 
the 
least 
surprise 
at 
seeing 
them
there.

"Is 
this 
the 
way 
to 
the 
princesses' 
apartments?" 
asked 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
of 
one 
of 
them.

"Yes," 
replied 
a 
footman 
in 
a 
bold 
loud 
voice, 
as 
if 
anything 
were
now 
permissible; 
"the 
door

the 
left, 
ma'am."

"Perhaps 
the 
count 
did 
not

for 
me," 
said 
Pierre 
when 
he 
reached
the 
landing. 
"I'd 
better 
go 
to 
my 
own 
room."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
paused 
and 
waited 
for 
him 
to 
come 
up.

"Ah, 
my 
friend!" 
she 
said, 
touching 
his 
<a href="/cZl/xN150Ptam.html">arm</a> 
as 
she 
had 
done 
her
son's 
when 
speaking 
to 
him 
that 
afternoon, 
"believe

I

you 
do, 
but

a

"But 
really, 
hadn't 
I 
better 
go 
away?" 
he 
asked, 
looking 
kindly 
at
her 
over 
his 
spectacles.

"Ah, 
my 
dear 
friend! 
Forget 
the 
wrongs 
that 
may 
have 
been 
done

Think 
that 
he 
is 
your 
father 
... 
perhaps 
in 
the

She
sighed. 
"I

a

the 
conviction 
that 
all 
this 
had
to 
be 
grew

He 
saw 
the 
whips 
in 
their 
red 
caps 
galloping 
along 
the 
edge 
of 
the
ravine, 
he 
even 
saw

and 
was 
expecting 
a 
fox 
to 
show 
itself
at 
any 
moment 
on 
the 
ryefield 
opposite.

The<p>
huntsman 
standing 
in 
the 
hollow 
moved 
and 
loosed 
his 
borzois, 
and
Nicholas 
saw 
a 
queer, 
short-legged 
red 
fox 
with 
a 
fine 
brush 
going 
hard
across 
the 
field. 
The 
borzois 
bore 
down 
on 
it.... 
Now 
they 
drew 
close
to 
the 
fox 
which 
began 
to 
dodge 
between 
the 
field 
in 
sharper 
and 
sharper
curves, 
trailing 
its 
brush, 
when 
suddenly 
a 
strange 
white 
borzoi 
dashed
in 
followed 
by 
a 
black 
one, 
and 
everything 
was 
in 
confusion; 
the 
borzois
formed 
a 
star-shaped 
figure, 
scarcely 
swaying 
their 
bodies 
and 
with
tails 
turned 
away 
from 
the 
center 
of 
the 
group. 
Two 
huntsmen 
galloped 
up
to 
the 
dogs; 
one 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/TL80r3HV.html">a</a> 
red 
cap, 
the 
other, 
a 
stranger, 
in 
a 
green 
coat.

"What's 
this?" 
thought 
Nicholas. 
"Where's 
that 
huntsman 
from?
He 
is 
not 
'Uncle's' 
man."

The 
huntsmen 
got 
the 
fox, 
but 
stayed 
there 
a 
long 
time 
without 
strapping
it

Their

bridled

there

The 
huntsmen

As 
always 
happens 
when 
women 
lead 
lonely 
lives 
for 
any

of 
time
without 
male 
society, 
on 
Anatole's

all 
the 
three 
women 
of
Prince 
Bolkonski's 
household 
felt 
that 
their 
life 
had 
not 
been 
real
till 
then. 
Their 
powers 
of 
reasoning, 
feeling, 
and 
observing 
immediately
increased 
tenfold, 
and 
their 
life, 
which 
seemed 
to 
have 
been 
passed 
in
darkness, 
was 
suddenly 
lit 
up 
by 
a 
new 
brightness, 
full 
of 
significance.

Princess 
Mary 
grew 
quite 
unconscious 
of 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">her</a> 
face 
and 
coiffure. 
The
handsome 
open 
face 
of 
the 
man 
who 
might 
perhaps 
be 
her 
husband 
absorbed
all 
her 
attention. 
He 
seemed 
to 
her 
kind, 
brave, 
determined, 
manly, 
and
magnanimous. 
She 
felt 
convinced 
of 
that. 
Thousands 
of 
dreams 
of 
a 
future
family 
life 
continually 
rose 
in 
her 
imagination. 
She 
drove 
them 
away 
and
tried 
to 
conceal 
them.

"But 
am 
I 
not 
too 
cold 
with 
him?" 
thought 
the 
princess. 
"I 
try
to 
be

I

And

to 
be 
cordial

"Poor

she's

Anatole.

Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
also

to 
great

in

she, 
a

along 
a
corridor 
to 
the 
cabinet 
where 
the 
Minister 
of 
War 
was 
at 
work. 
The
adjutant 
by 
his 
elaborate 
courtesy 
appeared 
to 
wish 
to 
ward 
off 
any
attempt 
at 
familiarity 
on 
the 
part 
of 
the 
Russian 
messenger.

Prince 
Andrew's 
joyous 
feeling 
was 
considerably 
weakened 
as 
he
approached 
the 
door 
of 
the 
minister's 
room. 
He 
felt 
offended, 
and
without 
his 
noticing 
it 
the 
feeling 
of 
offense 
immediately 
turned 
into
one 
of 
disdain 
which 
was 
quite 
uncalled 
for. 
His 
fertile 
mind 
instantly
suggested 
to 
him 
a 
point 
of 
view 
which 
gave 
him 
a 
right 
to 
despise
the 
adjutant 
and 
the 
minister. 
"Away 
from 
the 
smell 
of 
powder, 
they
probably 
think 
it 
easy 
to 
gain 
victories!" 
he 
thought.<p>
His<p>
eyes
narrowed 
disdainfully, 
he 
entered 
the 
room 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
War 
with
peculiarly 
deliberate 
steps. 
This 
feeling 
of 
disdain 
was 
heightened
when 
he 
saw 
the 
minister 
seated 
at 
a 
large 
table 
reading 
some 
papers
and 
making 
pencil 
notes<p>
on 
them, 
and 
for 
the 
first 
two 
or 
three 
minutes
taking 
no 
notice 
of 
his 
arrival. 
A 
wax 
candle 
stood 
at 
each<p>
side 
of 
the
minister's 
bent 
bald 
head 
with 
its 
gray 
temples. 
He 
went 
on 
reading
to 
the 
end, 
without 
raising 
his 
eyes 
at 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
door 
and 
the
sound 
of 
footsteps.

"Take 
this 
and 
deliver 
it," 
said 
he 
to 
his 
adjutant, 
handing 
him 
the
papers 
and 
still 
taking 
no 
notice 
of 
the 
special 
messenger.

Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
that 
either 
the 
actions 
of 
Kutuzov's 
army
interested 
the 
Minister 
of 
War 
less 
than 
any 
of 
the 
other 
matters 
he 
was
concerned 
with, 
or 
he 
wanted 
to 
give 
the 
Russian 
special 
messenger 
that
impression. 
"But 
that 
is 
a 
matter 
of 
perfect 
indifference 
to 
me," 
he
thought. 
The 
minister 
drew 
the<p>
remaining 
papers 
together, 
arranged 
them
evenly, 
and 
then 
raised 
his 
head. 
He 
had 
an 
intellectual 
and 
distinctive
head, 
but 
the 
instant 
he 
turned 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
the 
firm, 
intelligent
expression 
on 
his 
face 
changed 
in 
a 
way 
evidently 
deliberate 
and
habitual 
to 
him. 
His 
face 
took 
on 
the 
stupid 
artificial 
smile 
(which
does 
not 
even 
attempt 
to 
<a href="/cZl/qj9eXK5ZNkA6pXQvm.html">hide</a> 
its 
artificiality) 
of 
a 
man 
who 
is
continually 
receiving 
many 
petitioners 
one 
after 
another.

"From 
General 
Field 
Marshal 
Kutuzov?" 
he 
asked. 
"I 
hope 
it 
is
good 
news? 
There 
has 
been 
an 
encounter 
with 
Mortier? 
A 
victory? 
It 
was
high 
time!"

He 
took 
the 
dispatch 
which 
was 
addressed 
to 
him 
and 
began 
to 
read 
it
with 
a 
mournful 
expression.

"Oh, 
my 
God! 
My 
God! 
Schmidt!" 
he 
exclaimed 
in 
German. 
"What 
a
calamity!

Petya 
went 
on. 
"What 
would 
it 
be

you?... 
Oh,<p>
you 
want 
a 
knife?" 
he
said, 
turning 
to 
an 
officer 
who 
wished 
to 
cut 
himself 
a 
piece 
of 
mutton.

And 
he 
handed

The

admired

"Please 
keep

I 
have 
several

said 
Petya, 
blushing.
"Heavens! 
I 
was 
quite 
forgetting!" 
he 
suddenly 
cried. 
"I 
have 
some
raisins, 
fine

I 
am 
used 
to 
something
sweet. 
Would 
you 
like 
some?..." 
and 
Petya 
ran 
out 
into 
the 
passage 
to
his 
Cossack 
and 
brought 
back 
some 
bags 
which 
contained 
about 
five 
pounds
of 
raisins. 
"Have 
some, 
gentlemen, 
have 
some!"

"You 
want 
a 
coffeepot, 
don't 
you?" 
he 
asked 
the 
esaul. 
"I 
bought 
a
capital 
one 
from 
our 
sutler!<p>
He 
has 
splendid 
things. 
And 
he's 
very
honest, 
that's 
the 
chief 
thing. 
I'll 
be 
sure 
to 
send 
it 
to 
you. 
Or
perhaps 
your 
flints 
are 
giving

or 
are

out-that 
happens
sometimes, 
you

I 
have

he
showed 
a 
bag-"a

flints. 
I 
bought 
them 
very 
cheap. 
Please 
take 
as
many 
as 
you 
want, 
or 
all 
if 
you

Then 
suddenly, 
dismayed 
lest 
he 
had 
said 
too 
much, 
Petya 
stopped 
and
blushed.

He 
tried 
to 
remember 
whether 
he 
had 
not 
done 
anything 
else 
that 
was
foolish. 
And 
running 
over 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day 
he 
remembered 
the 
French
drummer 
boy. 
"It's 
capital 
for 
us 
here, 
but 
what 
of 
him? 
Where 
have 
they
put 
him? 
Have 
they 
fed 
him? 
Haven't 
they 
hurt 
his 
feelings?" 
he 
thought.
But 
having 
caught 
himself 
saying 
too 
much 
about 
the 
flints, 
he 
was 
now
afraid 
to 
speak 
out.

"I 
might 
ask," 
he 
thought, 
"but 
they'll 
say: 
'He's 
a 
boy 
himself<p>
and 
so
he 
pities 
the 
boy.' 
I'll 
show 
them 
tomorrow 
whether 
I'm 
a 
boy. 
Will 
it
seem 
odd 
if 
I 
ask?" 
Petya 
thought. 
"Well, 
never 
mind!" 
and 
immediately,
blushing 
and 
looking 
anxiously 
at 
the 
officers 
to 
see 
if 
they 
appeared
ironical, 
he 
said:

"May 
I 
call 
in 
that 
boy 
who 
was 
taken 
prisoner 
and 
give 
him 
something 
to
eat?... 
Perhaps..."

"Yes, 
he's 
a 
poor 
little 
fellow," 
said 
Denisov, 
who 
evidently 
saw
nothing 
shameful 
in 
this 
reminder. 
"Call 
him 
in. 
His 
name 
is 
Vincent
Bosse. 
Have 
him 
fetched."

"I'll 
call 
him," 
said 
Petya.

"Yes, 
yes, 
call<p>
him. 
A 
poor 
little 
fellow," 
Denisov 
repeated.

Petya 
was 
standing 
at 
the 
door 
when 
Denisov 
said 
this. 
He 
slipped 
in
between 
the 
officers, 
came 
close 
to 
Denisov, 
and 
said:

"Let 
me 
kiss 
you, 
dear 
old 
fellow! 
Oh, 
how 
fine, 
how 
splendid!"

And 
having 
kissed 
Denisov 
he 
ran 
out 
of 
the 
hut.

"Bosse! 
Vincent!" 
Petya 
cried, 
stopping 
outside 
the 
door.

"Who 
do 
you 
want, 
sir?" 
asked 
a 
voice 
in 
the 
darkness.

Petya 
replied 
that 
he 
wanted 
the 
French 
lad 
who 
had 
been 
captured 
that
day.

"Ah, 
Vesenny?" 
said 
a 
Cossack.

Vincent, 
the 
boy's 
name, 
had 
already 
been 
changed 
by 
the 
Cossacks 
into
Vesenny 
(vernal) 
and 
into 
Vesenya 
by 
the 
peasants 
and 
soldiers. 
In 
both
these 
adaptations 
the 
reference 
to 
spring 
(vesna) 
matched 
the 
impression
made 
by 
the 
young 
lad.

"He 
is 
warming 
himself 
there 
by 
the 
bonfire. 
Ho, 
Vesenya!
Vesenya!-Vesenny!" 
laughing 
voices 
were 
heard 
calling 
to<p>
one 
another 
in
the 
darkness.

"He's 
a 
smart 
lad," 
said 
an 
hussar 
standing 
near 
Petya. 
"We 
gave 
him
something 
to 
eat 
a 
while 
ago. 
He 
was 
awfully 
hungry!"

The 
sound 
of 
bare 
feet 
splashing 
through 
the 
mud<p>
was 
heard 
in 
the
darkness, 
and 
the 
drummer 
boy 
came 
to 
the 
door.

"Ah,

said 
Petya.

Two 
officers 
of 
his 
own 
division 
joined 
him. 
The 
conversation
naturally 
turned 
on 
the 
peace. 
The

his 
comrades,<p>
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/MjR5A9Fmd9tTlW.html">like</a>

of
the

dissatisfied

after 
the

Nicholas 
ate 
and

(chiefly 
the 
latter) 
in 
silence. 
He 
finished 
a
couple 
of 
bottles 
of 
wine 
by 
himself. 
The

in

went

tormenting

without

He 
feared 
to 
give

thoughts, 
yet 
could 
not

them. 
Suddenly, 
on 
one 
of

saying 
that 
it

humiliating 
to 
look 
at

French,
Rostov 
began

with 
uncalled-for 
wrath, 
and 
therefore 
much 
to
the 
surprise 
of 
the 
officers:

"How 
can 
you

what's

he 
cried, 
the 
blood 
suddenly
rushing 
to 
his

"How

"But

Rostov's 
outburst,
except 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
he 
was 
drunk.

But 
Rostov 
did 
not 
listen 
to 
him.

"We 
are 
not 
diplomatic 
officials, 
we 
are 
soldiers 
and 
nothing

he 
went 
on.

<a href="/aVzUge/SvD6UQ4ReoD7Y.html">Anna
Pavlovna's</a> 
hand 
and 
for 
some 
reason 
drawing 
it 
downwards. 
"Arrange
that 
affair 
for 
me 
and 
I 
shall 
always 
be 
your 
most 
devoted 
slave-slafe
with 
an 
f, 
as 
a 
village 
elder 
of 
mine 
writes 
in 
his 
reports. 
She 
is 
rich
and 
of 
good 
family 
and 
that's 
all 
I 
want."

And 
with 
the 
familiarity 
and 
easy 
grace 
peculiar 
to 
him, 
he 
raised 
the
maid 
of 
honor's 
hand 
to 
his 
lips, 
kissed 
it, 
and 
swung 
it 
to 
and 
fro
as 
he 
lay 
back 
in 
his 
armchair, 
looking 
in 
another 
direction.

"Attendez," 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
reflecting, 
"I'll 
speak 
to
Lise, 
young 
Bolkonski's 
wife, 
this 
very 
evening, 
and 
perhaps 
the
thing 
can 
be 
arranged. 
It 
shall 
be<p>
on 
your 
family's 
behalf 
that 
I'll
start 
my 
apprenticeship 
as 
old 
maid."





CHAPTER 
II

Anna 
Pavlovna's 
drawing 
room 
was 
gradually 
filling. 
The 
highest
Petersburg 
society 
was 
<a href="/cZl/PK5ZUI0EXJo9ON.html">assembled</a> 
there: 
people 
differing 
widely 
in 
age
and 
character 
but 
alike 
in 
the 
social 
circle 
to 
which 
they 
belonged.
Prince 
Vasili's 
daughter, 
the 
beautiful 
Helene,<p>
came 
to 
take 
her
father 
to 
the 
ambassador's 
entertainment; 
she 
wore 
a 
ball 
dress<p>
and
her 
badge 
as 
maid 
of 
honor. 
The 
youthful 
little 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya,
known 
as 
la 
femme 
la 
plus 
seduisante 
de 
Petersbourg, 
* 
was 
also 
there.
She 
had 
been 
married 
during 
the 
previous 
winter, 
and 
being 
pregnant 
did
not<p>
go 
to 
any 
large 
gatherings, 
but 
only 
to 
small 
receptions. 
Prince
Vasili's 
son, 
Hippolyte, 
had 
come 
with 
Mortemart, 
whom 
he 
introduced.
The 
Abbe 
Morio 
and 
many 
others 
had 
also 
come.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
The 
most 
fascinating 
woman 
in 
Petersburg.

To 
each 
new 
arrival 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
said, 
"You 
have 
not 
yet 
seen 
my
aunt," 
or 
"You 
do 
not<p>
know 
my 
aunt?" 
and 
very 
gravely 
conducted
him 
or 
her 
to 
a 
little 
old 
lady, 
wearing 
large 
bows 
of 
ribbon 
in 
her
cap, 
who 
had 
come 
sailing 
in 
from 
another 
room 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
guests
began 
to 
arrive; 
and 
slowly 
turning 
her 
eyes 
from 
the 
visitor 
to 
her
aunt, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
mentioned 
each 
one's 
name 
and 
then 
left 
them.

Each 
visitor 
performed 
the 
ceremony 
of 
greeting 
this 
old 
aunt 
whom 
not
one 
of 
them 
knew, 
not 
one 
of 
them 
wanted 
to 
know, 
and 
not 
one 
of 
them
cared 
about; 
Anna 
<a href="/aVzUge/WC6zmeD7cYy0.html">Pavlovna</a> 
observed 
these 
greetings 
with 
mournful 
and
solemn 
interest 
and 
silent 
approval. 
The 
aunt 
spoke 
to 
each 
of 
them 
in
the 
same 
words, 
about 
their 
health 
and 
her 
own, 
and 
the 
health 
of 
Her
Majesty, 
"who, 
thank 
God, 
was 
better 
today." 
And 
each 
visitor,
though 
politeness 
prevented 
his 
showing 
impatience, 
left 
the 
old 
woman
with 
a<p>
sense 
of 
relief 
at 
having 
performed 
a 
vexatious 
duty 
and 
did 
not
return 
to 
her 
the 
whole 
evening.

The 
young 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya 
had 
brought 
some 
work 
in 
a
gold-embroidered 
velvet 
bag. 
Her 
pretty 
little 
upper 
lip, 
on 
which 
a
delicate 
dark 
down 
was 
just 
perceptible, 
was 
too 
short 
for 
her 
teeth,
but 
it 
lifted 
all 
the 
more 
sweetly, 
and 
was 
especially 
charming 
when 
she
occasionally<p>
drew 
it 
down 
to 
meet 
the 
lower 
lip. 
As 
is 
always 
the 
case
with 
a 
thoroughly 
attractive 
woman, 
her 
defect-the 
shortness 
of 
her
upper 
lip 
and 
her 
half-open 
mouth-seemed 
to 
be 
her 
own 
special

said</h1>the 
countess,
coldly 
it 
seemed 
to 
Natasha. 
"Go... 
go," 
said 
the 
mother, 
sadly 
and
reproachfully, 
with 
a 
deep 
sigh, 
as 
her 
daughter 
ran 
away.

Natasha 
never 
remembered 
how 
she 
entered 
the 
drawing 
room. 
When 
she
came 
in 
and 
saw 
him 
she 
paused. 
"Is 
it 
possible 
that 
this 
stranger
has 
now 
become 
everything 
to 
me?" 
she 
asked 
herself, 
and 
immediately
answered, 
"Yes, 
everything! 
He 
alone 
is 
now 
dearer 
to 
me 
than
everything 
in 
the 
world." 
Prince 
Andrew 
came 
up 
to 
her 
with 
downcast
eyes.

"I 
have 
loved 
you 
from 
the 
very<p>
first 
moment 
I 
saw 
you. 
May 
I 
hope?"

He 
looked 
at 
her 
and 
was 
struck 
by 
the 
serious 
impassioned 
expression 
of
her 
face. 
Her 
face 
said: 
"Why 
ask? 
Why 
doubt 
what 
you 
cannot 
but 
know?
Why 
speak, 
when 
words 
cannot 
express 
what 
one 
feels?"

She 
drew 
near 
to 
him 
and 
stopped. 
He 
took 
her 
hand 
and 
kissed 
it.

"Do 
you 
love 
me?"

"Yes, 
yes!" 
Natasha 
murmured 
as 
if<p>
in 
vexation. 
Then 
she 
sighed
loudly 
and, 
catching 
her 
breath 
more 
and 
more 
quickly, 
began 
to 
sob.

"What 
is 
it? 
What's 
the 
matter?"

"Oh, 
I 
am 
so 
happy!" 
she 
replied, 
smiled 
through 
her 
tears, 
bent
over 
closer 
to 
him, 
paused 
for 
an 
instant 
as 
if 
asking 
herself 
whether
she 
might, 
and 
then 
kissed 
him.

Prince 
Andrew 
held 
her 
hands, 
looked 
into 
her 
eyes, 
and 
did 
not 
find
in 
his 
heart 
his 
former 
love 
for 
her. 
Something 
in 
him 
had 
suddenly
changed; 
there 
was 
no 
longer 
the 
former 
poetic 
and 
mystic 
charm 
of
desire, 
but 
there 
was 
pity 
for 
her 
feminine 
and 
childish 
weakness, 
fear
at 
her 
devotion 
and 
trustfulness, 
and 
an 
oppressive 
yet 
joyful 
sense 
of
the 
duty 
that 
now 
bound 
him 
to 
her 
forever. 
The 
present 
feeling, 
though
not 
so 
bright 
and 
poetic 
as 
the 
former, 
was 
stronger 
and 
more 
serious.

"Did 
your 
mother 
tell 
you 
that 
it 
cannot 
be 
for 
a 
year?" 
asked
Prince 
Andrew, 
still 
looking 
into 
her 
eyes.

"Is 
it 
possible 
that 
I-the 
'chit 
of 
a 
girl,' 
as 
everybody 
called
me," 
thought 
Natasha-"is 
it 
possible 
that 
I 
am 
now 
to 
be 
the
wife 
and 
the 
equal 
of 
this 
strange, 
dear, 
clever 
man 
whom 
even 
my<p>
father
looks 
up 
to? 
Can 
it 
be 
true? 
Can 
it 
be 
true 
that 
there 
can 
be 
no
more 
playing 
with 
life, 
that 
now 
I 
am 
grown 
up, 
that 
on 
me 
now 
lies
a 
responsibility 
for 
my 
every 
word 
and 
deed? 
Yes, 
but 
what 
did 
he 
ask
me?"

"No," 
she 
replied, 
but 
she 
had 
not 
understood 
his 
question.

"Forgive 
me!" 
he 
said. 
"But 
you 
are 
so 
young, 
and 
I 
have 
already
been 
through 
so 
much 
in 
life. 
I 
am 
afraid 
for 
you, 
you 
do 
not 
yet 
know
yourself."

Natasha 
listened 
with 
concentrated 
attention, 
trying 
but 
failing 
to
take 
in 
the 
meaning<p>
of 
his 
words.

"Hard 
as 
this 
year 
which 
delays 
my 
happiness 
will 
be," 
continued
Prince 
Andrew, 
"it 
will<p>
give 
you 
time 
to 
be 
sure 
of 
yourself. 
I 
ask
you 
to<p>
make 
me 
happy 
in 
a 
year, 
but 
you 
are 
free: 
our 
engagement 
shall
remain 
a 
secret, 
and 
should 
you 
find 
that 
you 
do 
not 
love 
me, 
or 
should
you 
come 
to 
love..." 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
an 
unnatural<p>
smile.

"Why 
do 
you 
say 
that?" 
Natasha 
interrupted 
him. 
"You 
know 
that
from 
the 
very<p>
day 
you 
first 
came 
to 
Otradnoe 
I 
have 
loved 
you," 
she
cried, 
quite 
convinced 
that 
she<p>
spoke 
the 
truth.

"In 
a 
year 
you 
will 
learn 
to 
know 
yourself...."

"A 
whole 
year!" 
Natasha 
repeated 
suddenly, 
only 
now 
realizing 
that
the 
marriage 
was 
to 
be 
postponed 
for 
a 
year. 
"But 
why 
a 
year? 
Why 
a
year?..."

CHAPTER 
XIII

One 
night 
when 
the 
old 
countess, 
in 
nightcap 
and 
dressing 
jacket,
without 
her 
false 
curls, 
and 
with 
her 
poor 
little 
knob 
of 
hair 
showing
under 
her 
white 
cotton 
cap, 
knelt 
sighing 
and 
groaning 
on 
a 
rug 
and
bowing 
to 
the 
ground 
in 
prayer, 
her 
door 
<a href="/cZl/sL9N2kW.html">creaked</a> 
and 
Natasha, 
also 
in
a 
dressing 
jacket 
with 
slippers 
on 
her 
bare 
feet 
and 
her 
hair 
in
curlpapers, 
ran 
in. 
The 
countess-her 
prayerful 
mood 
dispelled-looked
round 
and 
frowned. 
She 
was 
finishing 
her 
last 
prayer: 
"Can 
it 
be 
that
this 
couch 
will 
be 
my 
grave?" 
Natasha, 
flushed 
and 
eager, 
seeing
her 
mother 
in 
prayer, 
suddenly 
checked 
her 
rush, 
half 
sat 
down, 
and
unconsciously 
put 
out 
her 
tongue 
as 
if 
chiding 
herself. 
Seeing 
that
her 
mother 
was 
still 
praying 
she 
ran 
on 
tiptoe 
to 
the 
bed 
and, 
rapidly
slipping 
one 
little 
foot 
against 
the 
other, 
pushed 
off 
her 
slippers 
and
jumped 
onto 
the 
bed 
the 
countess 
had 
feared 
might 
become 
her 
grave. 
This
couch 
was 
high, 
with 
a 
feather 
bed 
and 
five 
pillows 
each 
smaller 
than
the 
one 
below. 
Natasha 
jumped 
on 
it, 
sank 
into 
the 
feather 
bed, 
rolled
over 
to 
the 
wall, 
and 
began 
snuggling 
up 
the 
bedclothes 
as 
she 
settled
down, 
raising 
her 
knees 
to 
her 
chin, 
kicking 
out 
and 
laughing 
almost
inaudibly, 
now 
covering 
herself 
up 
head 
and 
all, 
and 
now 
peeping 
at 
her
mother. 
The 
countess 
finished 
her 
prayers 
and 
came 
to 
the 
bed 
with 
a
stern 
face, 
but 
seeing 
that 
Natasha's 
head 
was 
covered, 
she 
smiled
in 
her 
kind, 
weak 
way.

"Now 
then, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vi2Pe7QJprO9e.html">now</a> 
then!" 
said 
she.

"Mamma, 
can 
we 
have 
a 
talk? 
Yes?" 
said 
Natasha. 
"Now, 
just 
one 
on
your 
throat 
and 
another... 
that'll 
do!" 
And 
seizing 
her 
mother 
round
the 
neck, 
she 
kissed 
her 
on 
the 
throat. 
In 
her 
behavior 
to 
her 
mother
Natasha 
seemed 
rough, 
but 
she 
was 
so 
sensitive 
and 
tactful 
that 
however
she 
clasped 
her 
mother 
she 
always 
managed 
to 
do 
it 
without 
hurting 
her
or 
making 
her 
feel 
uncomfortable 
or 
displeased.

"Well, 
what 
is 
it 
tonight?" 
said 
the 
mother, 
having 
arranged 
her
pillows 
and 
waited 
until 
Natasha, 
after 
turning 
over 
a 
couple 
of 
times,
had 
settled 
down 
beside 
her 
under 
the 
quilt,<p>
spread 
out 
her 
arms, 
and
assumed 
a 
serious 
expression.

These 
visits 
of 
Natasha's 
at 
night 
before 
the 
count 
returned 
from 
his
club 
were 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
pleasures 
of 
both 
mother, 
and 
daughter.

"What 
is 
it 
tonight?-But 
I 
have 
to 
tell 
you..."

Natasha 
put 
her 
hand 
on 
her 
mother's 
mouth.

"About 
Boris... 
I 
know," 
she 
said 
seriously; 
"that's 
what 
I
have 
come 
about. 
Don't 
say 
it-I 
know. 
No, 
do 
tell 
me!" 
and 
she
removed 
her 
hand.

"Board

"Catch

They 
seized 
Makar 
Alexeevich 
by 
the 
arms 
and 
dragged 
him 
to 
the 
door.

The 
vestibule 
was 
filled 
with 
the 
discordant 
sounds 
of 
a 
struggle 
and 
of
a 
tipsy, 
hoarse 
voice.

Suddenly 
a 
fresh 
sound, 
a 
piercing 
feminine 
scream, 
reverberated 
from
the 
porch

Everything

her 
with
reverence 
and 
was 
beyond

"Everyone

continued 
Prince 
Andrew.
"Fancy,

Princess

How<p>

that
I

and 
the 
whole 
secret 
lies 
in 
the 
terrible 
truth 
that 
she 
is 
a 
depraved
woman. 
Now 
I 
have 
spoken 
that 
terrible 
word 
to 
myself 
all 
has 
<a href="/aVzUge/hW2bXmQ81KA.html">become
clear.

"Anatole</a> 
used 
to 
come 
to 
borrow 
money 
from 
her 
and 
used 
to 
kiss 
her
naked 
shoulders. 
She 
did 
not 
give 
him 
the 
money, 
but 
let 
herself 
be
kissed. 
Her 
father 
in 
jest 
tried 
to 
rouse 
her 
jealousy, 
and 
she 
replied
with 
a 
calm 
smile 
that 
she 
was 
not 
so 
stupid 
as 
to 
be 
jealous: 
'Let
him 
do 
what 
he 
pleases,' 
she 
used 
to 
say 
of 
me. 
One 
day 
I 
asked 
her 
if
she 
felt 
any 
symptoms 
of 
pregnancy. 
She 
laughed 
contemptuously 
and 
said
she 
was 
not 
a 
fool 
to 
want 
to 
have 
children, 
and 
that 
she 
was 
not 
going
to 
have 
any 
children 
by 
me."

Then 
he 
recalled 
the 
coarseness 
and 
bluntness 
of 
her 
thoughts 
and 
the
vulgarity 
of<p>
the 
expressions 
that 
were 
natural 
to 
her, 
though 
she 
had
been 
brought 
up 
in 
the 
most 
aristocratic 
circles.

"I'm 
not 
such 
a 
fool.... 
Just 
you 
try 
it 
on.... 
Allez-vous

she 
used 
to 
say. 
Often

she 
had

young

old 
men

women 
Pierre 
could 
not

why 
he 
did 
not

her.

 
 
 
 
* 
"You 
clear 
out 
of 
this."


"Yes, 
I 
never

her," 
said 
he 
to 
himself; 
"I 
knew 
she 
was 
a

he 
repeated, 
"but

not

it

now

of

in

of 
an 
appearance 
of 
what
is 
called 
weak 
character, 
do 
not 
seek 
a 
confidant 
in 
their 
troubles. 
He
digested 
his 
sufferings<p>
alone.

"It 
is 
all, 
all 
her 
fault," 
he 
said 
to 
himself; 
"but 
what 
of

I

her? 
Why 
did 
I

was 
a

suddenly 
felt 
a 
desire

need

his 
most 
intimate

(which 
he 
would 
not

mother, 
his

or
his

to 
this 
woman 
who 
was<p>
almost 
a 
stranger. 
When 
he 
afterwards
recalled 
that 
impulse 
to 
unsolicited 
and 
inexplicable 
frankness 
which
had 
very 
important 
results

him, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him-as 
it 
seems 
to
everyone 
in 
such 
cases-that 
it 
was 
merely 
some 
silly 
whim 
that 
seized
him: 
yet 
that 
burst 
of 
frankness, 
together 
with 
other 
trifling 
events,
had 
immense 
consequences 
for 
him

"You

CHAPTER 
XXV

The 
officers 
were 
about 
to 
take 
leave, 
but 
Prince 
Andrew, 
apparently
reluctant 
to 
be 
left 
alone 
with 
his 
friend, 
asked 
them 
to 
stay 
and 
have
tea. 
Seats 
were 
brought 
in 
and 
so 
was 
the 
tea. 
The 
officers 
gazed 
with
surprise 
at 
Pierre's 
huge 
stout 
figure 
and 
listened 
to 
his 
talk 
of
Moscow 
and 
the 
position 
of 
our 
army, 
round 
which 
he 
had 
ridden. 
Prince
Andrew 
remained 
silent, 
and 
his 
expression<p>
was 
so 
forbidding 
that 
Pierre
addressed 
his 
remarks 
chiefly 
to 
the 
good-natured 
battalion 
commander.

"So 
you 
understand 
the 
whole 
position 
<a href="/aVzUge/NhF3gdRt8E.html">of</a> 
our 
troops?" 
Prince 
Andrew
interrupted 
him.

"Yes-that 
is, 
how 
do 
you 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tHL2iU9hxx7.html">mean?"</a> 
said 
Pierre. 
"Not 
being 
a 
military 
man
I 
can't 
say 
I 
have 
understood 
it 
fully, 
but 
I 
understand 
the 
general
position."

"Well, 
then, 
you 
know 
more 
than 
anyone<p>
else, 
be 
it 
who 
it 
may," 
said
Prince 
Andrew.

"Oh!" 
said 
Pierre, 
looking 
over 
his 
spectacles 
in 
perplexity 
at 
Prince
Andrew. 
"Well, 
and 
what 
do 
you 
think 
of 
Kutuzov's 
appointment?" 
he
asked.

"I 
was 
very 
glad 
of 
his 
appointment, 
that's 
all 
I 
know," 
replied 
Prince
Andrew.

"And 
tell 
me 
your 
opinion 
of 
Barclay 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Xs7HAb8Wu7IQlv.html">de</a> 
Tolly. 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wq6bvg28.html">In</a> 
Moscow 
they 
are 
saying
heaven 
knows 
what 
about 
him.... 
What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
him?"

"Ask 
them," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew, 
indicating 
the 
officers.

Pierre 
looked 
at 
Timokhin

a 
fit 
of 
absent-mindedness 
she 
sat 
still, 
her
luminous 
eyes 
gazing 
fixedly 
before 
her,<p>
not 
noticing 
that 
he 
had 
risen.

Nicholas 
glanced 
at 
her 
and, 
wishing 
to 
appear 
not 
to 
notice 
her
abstraction, 
made 
some 
remark 
to 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
and 
then
again 
looked 
at 
the 
princess. 
She 
still 
sat 
motionless 
with 
a 
look 
of
suffering 
on 
her 
gentle 
face. 
He 
suddenly 
felt 
sorry 
for 
her 
and 
was
vaguely 
conscious 
that 
he 
might 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
sadness 
her 
face
expressed. 
He 
wished 
to 
help 
her 
and 
say 
something 
pleasant, 
but 
could
think 
of 
nothing 
to 
say.

"Good-by, 
Princess!" 
said 
he.

She 
started, 
flushed, 
and 
sighed 
deeply.

"Oh, 
I 
beg 
your 
pardon," 
she 
said 
as 
if 
waking 
up. 
"Are 
you 
going
already, 
Count? 
Well 
then, 
good-by! 
Oh, 
but 
the 
cushion 
for 
the
countess!"

"Wait 
a 
moment, 
I'll 
fetch 
it," 
said 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
and 
she
left 
the 
room.

They 
both 
sat 
silent, 
with 
an 
occasional 
glance 
at 
one 
another.

"Yes, 
Princess," 
said 
Nicholas 
at 
last 
with 
a 
sad 
smile, 
"it 
doesn't
seem 
long 
ago 
since 
we 
first 
met 
at 
Bogucharovo, 
but 
how 
much 
water
has 
flowed 
since 
then! 
In 
what 
distress 
we 
all 
seemed 
to 
be 
then, 
yet
I 
would 
give 
much 
to 
bring 
back 
that 
time... 
but 
there's 
no 
bringing 
it
back."

Princess<p>
Mary 
gazed 
intently 
into 
his 
eyes 
with 
her 
own 
luminous 
ones
as 
he 
said 
this. 
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
trying 
to 
fathom 
the 
hidden 
meaning 
of
his 
words 
which 
would 
explain 
his 
feeling 
for 
her.

"Yes, 
yes," 
said 
she, 
"but 
you 
have 
no 
reason 
to 
regret 
the 
past, 
Count.
As 
I 
understand 
your 
present 
life, 
I 
think 
you 
will 
always 
recall 
it
with 
satisfaction, 
because 
the 
self-sacrifice 
that 
fills 
it 
now..."

"I 
cannot 
accept 
your 
praise," 
he 
interrupted 
her 
hurriedly. 
"On 
the
contrary 
I 
continually 
reproach 
myself.... 
But 
this 
is 
not 
at 
all 
an
interesting 
or 
cheerful 
subject."

His 
face 
again 
resumed 
its 
former 
stiff 
and 
cold 
expression. 
But 
the
princess 
had 
caught 
a 
glimpse 
of 
the 
man 
she 
had 
known 
and 
loved, 
and 
it
was 
to 
him 
that 
she 
now 
spoke.

"I 
thought 
you 
would 
allow 
me 
to 
tell 
you 
this," 
she 
said. 
"I 
had 
come
so 
near 
to 
you... 
and 
to 
all 
your 
family 
that 
I 
thought 
you 
would<p>
not
consider 
my 
sympathy 
misplaced, 
but 
I 
was 
mistaken," 
and 
suddenly 
her
voice 
trembled. 
"I 
don't 
know 
why," 
she 
continued, 
recovering 
herself,
"but 
you 
used 
to 
be 
<a href="/cZl/dG51mk.html">different,</a> 
and..."

"There 
are 
a 
thousand 
reasons 
why," 
laying 
special 
emphasis 
on 
the 
why.
"Thank 
you, 
Princess," 
he 
added 
softly. 
"Sometimes 
it 
is 
hard."

"So 
that's 
why! 
That's 
why!" 
a 
voice 
whispered 
in 
Princess 
Mary's 
soul.
"No, 
it 
was 
not 
only 
that 
gay, 
kind, 
and 
frank 
look, 
not 
only 
that
handsome 
exterior, 
that 
I 
loved 
in 
him. 
I 
<a href="/cZl/xh7tHLaX5Z.html">divined</a> 
his 
noble, 
resolute,
self-sacrificing 
spirit 
too," 
she 
said 
to 
herself. 
"Yes,<p>
he 
is 
poor 
now
and 
I 
am 
rich.... 
Yes, 
that's 
the 
only 
reason.... 
Yes, 
were 
it 
not 
for
that..." 
And 
remembering 
his 
former 
tenderness, 
and 
looking 
now 
at 
his
kind,<p>
sorrowful 
face, 
she 
suddenly 
understood 
the 
cause 
of 
his 
coldness.

"But 
why, 
Count, 
why?" 
she 
almost 
cried, 
unconsciously 
moving 
closer 
to
him. 
"Why? 
Tell 
me. 
You 
must 
tell 
me!"

He 
was 
silent.

"I 
don't 
understand 
your 
why, 
Count,"

Next 
day 
Rostov 
saw 
Denisov 
off. 
He 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
stay 
another
day 
in 
Moscow. 
All 
Denisov's 
Moscow 
friends<p>
gave 
him 
a 
farewell
entertainment 
at 
the 
gypsies', 
with 
the 
result

was

After<p>
Denisov's 
departure, 
Rostov 
spent 
another 
fortnight 
in 
Moscow,
without 
going 
out 
of 
the 
house, 
waiting 
for 
the 
money 
his 
father 
could
not

he 
spent 
most

parties, 
dinners, 
lunches, 
and 
balls, 
giving 
him
no 
time 
for 
reflection, 
as 
in 
Petersburg. 
Instead 
of 
the 
new 
life 
he 
had
hoped 
to 
<a href="/cZl/Wt4epgGc7L4Z.html">lead</a> 
he 
still 
lived 
the 
old 
life, 
only 
in 
new 
surroundings.

Of 
the 
three 
precepts 
of 
Freemasonry 
Pierre 
realized 
that 
he 
did 
not
fulfill 
the 
one 
which 
enjoined 
every 
Mason 
to 
set 
an 
example 
<a href="/aVzUge/oF9CKY7wjGAw5Scb.html">of</a> 
moral
life, 
and 
that 
of 
the 
seven 
virtues 
<a href="/cZl/ONG1G2HQTp9iPl.html">he</a> 
lacked 
two-morality 
and 
the
love 
of 
death. 
He 
consoled 
himself 
with 
the 
thought 
that 
he 
fulfilled
another 
of 
the 
precepts-that 
of 
reforming 
the 
human 
race-and 
had
other 
virtues-love 
of 
his 
neighbor, 
and 
especially 
generosity.

In 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Uo1Eh4xgX7ZMYAE.html">spring</a> 
of 
1807 
he 
decided 
to 
return 
to 
Petersburg. 
On 
the 
way 
he
intended 
to 
visit 
all 
his 
estates 
and 
see 
for 
himself 
how 
far 
his 
orders
had 
been 
carried 
out 
and 
in 
what 
state 
were 
the 
serfs 
whom 
God 
had
entrusted 
to 
his 
care 
and 
whom 
he 
intended 
to 
benefit.

The 
chief 
steward, 
who 
considered 
the 
young 
count's 
attempts 
almost
insane-unprofitable 
to 
himself, 
to 
the 
count, 
and 
to 
the 
serfs-made
some 
concessions. 
Continuing 
to 
represent 
the<p>
liberation 
of 
the 
serfs
as 
impracticable, 
he 
arranged 
for 
the 
erection 
of 
large
buildings-schools, 
hospitals, 
and 
asylums-on 
all 
the 
estates
before 
the 
master 
arrived. 
Everywhere 
preparations 
were 
made 
not 
for
ceremonious 
welcomes 
(which 
he 
knew 
Pierre 
would 
not 
like), 
but 
for 
just
such 
gratefully 
religious 
ones, 
with 
offerings 
of 
icons 
and 
the 
bread
and 
salt 
of 
hospitality, 
as, 
according 
to 
his 
understanding 
of 
his
master, 
would 
touch 
and 
delude 
him.

The 
southern 
spring, 
the 
comfortable 
rapid 
traveling 
in 
a 
Vienna
carriage, 
and 
the 
solitude 
of 
the 
road, 
all 
had 
a 
gladdening 
effect 
on
Pierre. 
The

always 
said

was 
the 
only

capable 
of 
defeating
Napoleon."

But 
next 
day 
no 
news 
arrived 
from 
the 
army 
and 
the 
public 
mood 
grew
anxious. 
The 
courtiers 
suffered 
because 
of 
the 
suffering 
the 
suspense
occasioned 
the 
Emperor.

"Fancy 
the 
Emperor's 
position!" 
said 
they, 
and 
instead 
of 
extolling
Kutuzov 
as 
they 
had 
done 
the 
day 
before, 
they 
condemned 
him 
as 
the 
cause
of 
the 
Emperor's 
anxiety. 
That 
day 
Prince 
Vasili 
no 
longer 
boasted 
of
his 
protege 
Kutuzov, 
but 
remained 
silent 
when 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
was
mentioned. 
Moreover, 
toward 
evening, 
as 
if 
everything 
conspired 
to 
make
Petersburg 
society 
anxious 
and 
uneasy, 
a 
terrible 
piece 
of 
news 
was
added. 
Countess 
Helene 
Bezukhova 
had 
suddenly 
died 
of 
that 
terrible
malady 
<a href="/aVzUge/EM33CT3Fv.html">it</a> 
had 
been 
so 
agreeable 
to 
mention. 
Officially, 
at 
large
gatherings, 
everyone 
said 
that 
Countess 
Bezukhova 
had 
died 
of 
a
terrible 
attack 
of 
angina 
pectoris, 
but 
in 
intimate 
circles 
details
were 
mentioned 
of 
how 
the 
private 
physician 
of 
the 
Queen 
of 
Spain 
had
prescribed 
small 
doses 
of 
a 
certain 
drug 
to 
produce 
a 
certain 
effect;
but 
Helene, 
tortured 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
old 
count 
suspected 
her 
and
that 
her<p>
husband 
to 
whom 
she 
had 
written 
(that 
wretched, 
profligate
Pierre) 
had 
not 
replied, 
had 
suddenly 
taken 
a 
very 
large 
dose 
of 
the
drug, 
and 
had 
died 
in 
agony 
before 
assistance 
could 
be 
rendered 
her.
It 
was 
said 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
the 
old 
count 
had 
turned 
upon 
the
Italian, 
but 
the 
latter 
had 
produced 
such 
letters 
from 
the 
unfortunate
deceased 
that 
they 
had 
immediately 
let 
the 
matter 
drop.

Talk 
in 
general 
centered 
round 
three 
melancholy 
facts: 
the 
Emperor's
lack 
of 
news, 
the 
loss 
of 
Kutaysov, 
and 
the 
death 
of 
Helene.

On 
the 
third 
day 
after 
Kutuzov's 
report 
a 
country 
gentleman 
arrived 
from
Moscow, 
and 
news 
of 
the 
surrender 
of 
Moscow 
to 
the 
French 
spread 
through
the 
whole 
town. 
This 
was 
terrible! 
What 
a 
position 
for 
the 
Emperor 
to
be 
in! 
Kutuzov 
was 
a 
traitor, 
and 
Prince 
Vasili 
during 
the 
visits 
of
condolence 
paid 
to 
him 
on 
the 
occasion 
of 
his 
daughter's 
death 
said 
of
Kutuzov, 
whom 
he 
had 
formerly 
praised 
(it 
was 
excusable 
for 
him 
in 
his
grief 
to 
forget 
what 
he 
had 
said), 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
expect
anything 
else 
from 
a 
blind 
and 
depraved 
old 
man.

"I 
only 
wonder 
that 
the 
fate 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oUZ59J1bI.html">Russia</a> 
could 
have 
been 
entrusted 
to 
such
a 
man."

As 
long 
as 
this 
news 
remained 
unofficial 
it 
was 
possible<p>
to 
doubt 
it,
but 
the 
next 
day 
the 
following 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tHL2iU9hxx7.html">communication</a> 
was 
received 
from 
Count
Rostopchin:

Prince 
Kutuzov's 
adjutant 
has 
brought 
me 
a 
letter 
in 
which 
he 
demands
police 
officers 
<a href="/aVzUge/td26W1kQqNG.html">to</a> 
guide 
the 
army 
to 
the 
Ryazan 
road. 
He<p>
writes 
that
he 
is 
regretfully 
abandoning 
Moscow. 
Sire! 
Kutuzov's 
action 
decides 
the
fate 
of 
the 
capital 
and 
of 
your 
empire! 
Russia 
will 
shudder 
to 
learn 
of
the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
city 
in 
which 
her 
greatness 
is 
centered 
and 
in
which 
lie 
the 
ashes 
of 
your 
ancestors! 
I 
shall 
follow 
the 
army. 
I 
have
had 
everything 
removed, 
and 
it 
only 
remains 
for 
me 
to 
weep 
over 
the 
fate
of 
my 
fatherland.

On 
receiving 
this 
dispatch 
the 
Emperor 
sent 
Prince 
Volkonski 
to 
Kutuzov
with 
the 
following 
rescript:

Michael 
Ilarionovich!

is 
no

which 
exists
only 
to 
give 
measure 
to 
the 
words. 
As 
a 
result 
of<p>
this 
the 
unconsidered
tune, 
like 
the 
song 
of 
a 
bird, 
was 
extraordinarily 
good. 
Natasha 
was 
in
ecstasies 
over 
"Uncle's" 
singing. 
She 
resolved 
to 
give 
up 
learning
the 
harp 
and 
to 
play 
only 
the 
guitar. 
She 
asked 
"Uncle" 
for 
his
guitar 
and 
at 
once 
found 
the 
chords 
of 
the 
song.

After 
nine 
o'clock 
two 
traps 
and 
three 
mounted 
men, 
who 
had 
been 
sent
to 
look 
for 
them, 
arrived 
to 
fetch 
Natasha 
and 
Petya. 
The 
count 
and
countess 
did 
not 
know 
where 
they 
were 
and 
were 
very 
anxious, 
said 
one 
of
the 
men.

Petya 
was 
carried 
out 
like 
a 
log 
and 
laid 
in 
the 
larger 
of 
the 
two
traps. 
Natasha 
and 
Nicholas 
got 
into 
the 
other. 
"Uncle" 
wrapped
Natasha 
up 
warmly 
and 
took 
leave 
of 
her 
with 
quite 
a 
new 
tenderness. 
He
accompanied 
them 
on 
foot 
as 
far 
as 
the 
bridge 
that 
could 
not 
be 
crossed,
so 
that 
they 
had 
to 
go 
round 
by 
the 
ford, 
and 
he 
sent 
huntsmen 
to 
ride
in 
front 
with 
lanterns.

"Good-by, 
dear 
niece," 
his 
voice 
called 
out 
of 
the 
darkness-not
the 
voice 
Natasha 
had 
known 
previously, 
but 
the 
one 
that 
had 
sung 
As
'twas 
growing 
dark 
last 
night.

In 
the 
village 
through 
which 
they 
passed 
there 
were 
red 
lights 
and 
a
cheerful 
smell 
of 
smoke.

"What 
a 
darling 
Uncle 
is!" 
said 
Natasha, 
when 
they 
had 
come 
out
onto 
the 
highroad.

"Yes," 
returned 
Nicholas. 
"You're 
not 
cold?"

"No. 
I'm 
quite, 
quite 
all 
right. 
I 
feel 
so 
comfortable!" 
answered
Natasha, 
almost 
perplexed 
by 
her 
feelings. 
They 
remained 
silent 
a 
long
while. 
The 
night 
was 
dark 
and 
damp. 
They 
could 
not 
see 
the 
horses, 
but
only 
heard 
them 
splashing 
through 
the 
unseen 
mud.

What 
was 
passing 
in 
that 
receptive 
childlike 
soul 
that 
so 
eagerly 
caught
and 
assimilated 
all 
the 
diverse 
impressions 
of 
life? 
How 
did 
they 
all
find 
place 
in 
her? 
But 
she 
was 
very 
happy. 
As 
they 
were 
nearing 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/vVJ1JCLL3ka8WMYlo.html">home</a> 
she
suddenly 
struck 
up 
the 
air 
of 
As 
'twas 
growing 
dark 
last 
night-the
tune 
of 
which 
she 
had 
all 
the 
way 
been 
trying 
to 
get 
and 
had 
at<p>
last
caught.

"Got 
it?" 
said 
Nicholas.

"What 
were 
you 
thinking 
about 
just 
now, 
Nicholas?" 
inquired
Natasha.

They 
were 
fond 
of 
asking 
one 
another 
that 
question.

"I?" 
said 
Nicholas, 
trying 
to 
remember. 
"Well, 
you 
see, 
first 
I
thought 
that 
Rugay, 
the 
red 
hound, 
was 
like 
Uncle, 
and 
that 
if 
he 
were
a 
man 
he 
would 
always 
keep 
Uncle 
near 
him, 
if 
not 
for 
his 
riding, 
then
for 
his 
manner. 
What 
a 
good 
fellow 
Uncle 
is! 
Don't 
you 
think 
so?...
Well, 
and 
you?"

"I? 
Wait 
a 
bit, 
wait.... 
Yes, 
first 
I 
thought 
that 
we 
are 
driving
along 
and 
imagining 
that 
we 
are 
going 
home, 
but 
that 
heaven 
knows
where 
we 
are 
really 
going 
in 
the 
darkness, 
and 
that 
we 
shall 
arrive 
and
suddenly 
find 
that 
we 
are 
not 
in 
Otradnoe, 
but 
in 
Fairyland. 
And 
then 
I
thought... 
No, 
nothing 
else."

"I 
know, 
I 
expect 
you 
thought 
of 
him," 
said 
Nicholas, 
smiling 
as
Natasha 
knew 
by 
the 
sound 
of 
his 
<a href="/aVzUge/mW8bI8Ptam1D.html">voice.

"No,"</a> 
said 
Natasha, 
though 
she 
had 
in 
reality 
been 
thinking 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Cc59H6i.html">about
Prince</a> 
Andrew 
at 
the 
same 
time 
as 
of 
the 
rest, 
and 
of 
how 
he 
would
have 
liked 
"Uncle." 
"And 
then 
I 
was 
saying 
to 
myself 
all 
the<p>
way,
'How 
well 
Anisya 
carried 
herself, 
how 
well!'" 
And 
Nicholas 
heard
her 
spontaneous, 
happy, 
ringing 
laughter. 
"And 
do 
you 
know," 
she
suddenly 
said, 
"I 
know 
that 
I 
shall 
never 
again 
be 
as 
happy 
and
tranquil 
as 
I 
am 
now."

"Rubbish, 
nonsense, 
humbug!" 
exclaimed 
Nicholas, 
and 
he 
thought:
"How 
charming 
this 
Natasha 
of 
mine 
is! 
I 
have 
no 
other 
friend 
like
her 
and 
never 
shall 
have. 
Why 
should 
she 
marry? 
We 
might 
always 
drive
about 
together!"

"What 
a 
darling 
this 
Nicholas 
of 
mine 
is!"

not

Nicholas 
glanced 
at

wishing 
to 
appear 
not

notice 
her
abstraction, 
made 
some 
remark 
to 
Mademoiselle

then
again 
looked 
at

She 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Kt1fqZYy6E2U.html">still</a>

motionless 
<a href="/aVzUge/rP1Ikp3mbEd7.html">with</a>

he.

She 
started, 
flushed, 
and 
sighed 
deeply.

"Oh,

she 
said 
as

"Are

would

so 
strange, 
so 
strange! 
I 
can't 
make 
it 
out. 
I 
don't
know, 
I 
am 
very 
far 
from 
having 
military 
tastes, 
but 
in 
these 
times 
no
one 
can 
answer 
for 
himself."

After 
dinner 
the 
count 
settled 
himself 
comfortably 
in 
an 
easy 
chair 
and
with 
a 
serious 
face 
asked 
Sonya, 
who 
was 
considered 
an 
excellent 
reader,
to 
read 
the 
appeal.

"To 
Moscow, 
our 
ancient 
Capital!

"The 
enemy 
has 
entered 
the 
borders 
of 
Russia 
with 
immense 
forces. 
He
comes 
to 
despoil 
our 
beloved 
country."

Sonya 
read 
painstakingly 
in 
her 
high-pitched 
voice. 
The 
count 
listened
with 
closed 
eyes, 
heaving 
abrupt 
sighs 
at 
certain 
passages.

Natasha 
sat 
erect, 
gazing 
with 
a 
searching 
look 
now 
at 
her 
father 
and
now 
at 
Pierre.

Pierre 
felt 
her 
eyes 
on<p>
him 
and 
tried 
not 
to 
look 
round. 
The 
countess
shook 
her 
head 
disapprovingly 
and 
angrily 
at 
every 
solemn 
expression
in 
the 
manifesto. 
In 
all 
these 
words 
she 
saw 
only 
that 
the 
danger
threatening 
her 
son 
would 
not 
soon 
be 
over. 
Shinshin, 
with 
a 
sarcastic
smile 
on 
his 
lips, 
was 
evidently 
preparing 
to 
make 
fun 
of 
anything 
that
gave 
him 
the 
opportunity: 
Sonya's 
reading, 
any 
remark 
of 
the 
count's, 
or
even 
the 
manifesto 
itself 
should 
no 
better 
pretext 
present 
itself.

After 
reading 
about 
the 
dangers 
that 
<a href="/cZl/VI2EVa2As5NSUp.html">threatened</a> 
Russia, 
the 
hopes 
the
Emperor 
placed 
on 
Moscow 
and 
especially 
on 
its 
<a href="/aVzUge/lX3eplAZ1Im2mGGRm.html">illustrious</a> 
nobility,
Sonya, 
with 
a 
quiver 
in 
her 
voice 
due 
chiefly 
to 
the 
attention 
that 
was
being 
paid 
to 
her, 
read 
the 
last 
words:

"We 
ourselves 
will 
not 
delay 
to 
appear 
among 
our 
people 
in 
that 
Capital
and 
in 
other 
parts 
of 
our 
realm 
for 
consultation, 
and 
for 
the 
direction
of 
all 
our 
levies, 
both 
those 
now 
barring 
the 
enemy's 
path 
and 
those
freshly 
formed 
to 
defeat 
him 
wherever 
he 
may 
appear. 
May 
the 
ruin 
he
hopes 
to 
bring 
upon 
us 
recoil 
on 
his 
own 
head, 
and 
may 
Europe 
delivered
from 
bondage 
glorify 
the 
name 
of 
Russia!"


"Yes, 
that's 
it!" 
cried 
the 
count, 
opening 
his 
moist 
eyes 
and 
sniffing
repeatedly, 
as 
if 
a 
strong 
vinaigrette 
had 
been 
held 
to 
his 
nose; 
and 
he
added, 
"Let 
the 
Emperor 
but 
say 
the 
word 
and 
we'll 
sacrifice 
everything
and 
begrudge 
nothing."

She

"Natasha,

A

Madame

glowed, 
they 
were 
hungry 
and 
very 
cheerful.
They 
looked 
at 
one 
another 
(now 
that 
the

was 
over

they

peal 
of 
ringing

even 
before
they 
had 
a

ready

account 
for 
it.

After 
a 
while 
"Uncle" 
came 
in, 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/qi4V4ieowf1.html">a</a> 
Cossack 
coat, 
blue 
trousers, 
and
small 
top 
boots. 
And 
Natasha 
<a href="/nocrawl/cZl/CiG4GFXfk5SN4ioN.html">felt</a> 
that 
this 
costume, 
the 
very 
one 
she

was 
just

not 
at 
<a href="/aVzUge/kj1D1gi6dii.html">all</a> 
worse 
than 
a

"Uncle" 
too 
was 
in 
high 
spirits 
and 
far 
from 
being 
offended 
by 
the
brother's 
and 
sister's 
laughter 
(it 
could 
never 
enter 
his 
head 
that
they 
might 
be 
laughing 
at 
his 
way 
of 
life) 
he 
himself 
joined 
in 
the
merriment.

"That's 
right, 
young 
countess, 
that's 
it, 
come 
on! 
I 
never 
saw
anyone 
like 
her!" 
said 
he, 
offering 
Nicholas 
a 
pipe 
with 
a 
long 
stem
and, 
with 
a 
practiced 
motion 
of 
three 
fingers, 
taking 
down 
another 
that
had 
been<p>
cut 
short. 
"She's 
ridden 
all 
day 
like 
a 
man, 
and 
is 
as
fresh 
as 
ever!"

Soon 
after 
"Uncle's" 
reappearance 
the 
door 
was 
opened, 
evidently
from 
the 
sound 
by 
a 
barefooted 
girl, 
and 
a 
stout, 
rosy, 
good-looking
woman 
of 
about 
forty, 
with 
a 
double 
chin 
and 
full 
red 
lips, 
entered
carrying 
a 
large 
loaded 
tray. 
With 
hospitable 
dignity 
and 
cordiality 
in
her 
glance 
and 
in 
every 
motion, 
she 
looked 
at 
the 
visitors 
and, 
with
a 
pleasant 
smile, 
bowed 
respectfully. 
In 
spite 
of 
her 
exceptional
stoutness, 
which 
caused 
her 
to 
protrude 
her 
chest 
and 
stomach 
and 
throw
back 
her 
head, 
this 
woman 
(who 
was 
"Uncle's" 
housekeeper) 
trod
very 
lightly. 
She 
went 
to 
the 
table, 
set 
down 
the 
tray, 
and 
with<p>
her
plump 
white 
hands 
deftly 
took 
from 
it 
the 
bottles 
and 
various 
hors
d'oeuvres 
and 
dishes 
and 
arranged 
them 
on 
the 
table. 
When 
she 
had
finished, 
she 
stepped 
aside 
and 
stopped 
at 
the 
door 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/AXs4UJpiB1VEt9Im.html">with</a> 
a 
smile 
on 
her
face. 
"Here 
I 
am. 
I 
am 
she! 
Now 
do 
you 
understand 
'Uncle'?" 
her
expression 
said 
to 
Rostov. 
How 
could<p>
one 
help 
understanding? 
Not 
only
Nicholas, 
but 
even 
Natasha 
understood 
the 
meaning 
of 
his 
puckered 
brow
and 
the 
happy 
complacent 
smile 
that 
slightly 
puckered 
his 
lips 
when
Anisya 
Fedorovna 
entered. 
On 
the 
tray 
was 
a 
bottle 
of 
herb 
wine,
different 
kinds 
of 
vodka, 
<a href="/aVzUge/MLv29oRCc2bju.html">pickled</a>

All 
this 
was 
the

The

The 
European 
system 
was
already

all

remained

to 
organize

Satisfied

I
too 
should 
have 
had 
my 
Congress

my 
Holy 
Alliance. 
Those 
ideas 
were
stolen 
from 
me. 
In 
that 
reunion

great 
sovereigns 
we 
should 
have
discussed 
our 
interests 
like 
one 
family, 
and 
have 
rendered 
account

the

the 
freedom 
of 
all 
navigable
rivers 
for 
everybody, 
that 
the 
seas 
should 
be 
common 
to 
all, 
and 
that
the 
great 
standing 
armies 
should 
be 
reduced 
henceforth 
to 
mere 
guards
for 
the 
sovereigns.

the

subordination 
of 
man's 
freedom 
to
the 
law 
of 
God," 
the 
voice 
had 
said. 
"Simplicity 
is 
submission 
to 
the
will 
of 
God; 
you 
cannot 
escape 
from 
Him. 
And 
they 
are 
simple. 
They 
do
not 
talk, 
but 
act. 
The 
spoken 
word 
is 
silver 
but 
the 
unspoken 
is 
golden.
Man 
can 
be 
master 
of 
nothing 
while 
he 
fears 
death, 
but 
he 
who 
does 
not
fear 
it 
possesses 
all. 
If 
there 
were 
no 
suffering, 
man 
would 
not 
know
his 
limitations, 
would 
not 
know 
himself. 
The 
hardest 
thing 
(Pierre 
went
on 
thinking, 
or 
hearing, 
in 
his 
dream) 
is 
to 
be 
able 
in 
your 
soul 
to
unite 
the 
meaning 
of 
all. 
To 
unite 
all?" 
he 
asked 
himself. 
"No, 
not
to 
unite. 
Thoughts 
cannot 
be 
united, 
but 
to 
harness 
all 
these 
thoughts
together 
is 
what 
we 
need! 
Yes, 
one 
must 
harness 
them, 
must 
harness
them!" 
he 
repeated 
to 
himself 
with 
inward 
rapture, 
feeling 
that 
these
words 
and 
they 
alone 
expressed 
what 
he 
wanted 
to 
say 
and 
solved 
the
question 
that 
tormented 
him.

"Yes, 
one 
must<p>
harness, 
it 
is<p>
time 
to 
harness."

"Time 
to 
harness, 
time 
to 
harness, 
your 
excellency! 
Your 
excellency!"
some 
voice 
was 
repeating. 
"We 
must 
harness, 
it 
is 
time 
to 
harness...."

It 
was 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
groom, 
trying 
to 
wake 
him. 
The 
sun 
shone
straight 
into 
Pierre's 
face. 
He 
glanced 
at 
the 
dirty 
innyard 
in 
the
middle 
of 
which 
soldiers 
were 
watering 
their 
lean 
horses 
at 
the 
pump
while 
carts 
were 
passing 
out 
of 
the 
gate. 
Pierre 
turned 
away 
with
repugnance, 
and 
closing 
his 
eyes 
quickly 
fell 
back 
on 
the 
carriage 
seat.
"No, 
I 
don't 
want 
that, 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
see 
and 
understand 
that. 
I 
want
to 
understand 
what 
was 
revealing 
itself 
to 
me 
<a href="/aVzUge/bh1zNkID7Gmw.html">in</a> 
my 
dream. 
One 
second
more 
and 
I 
should 
have 
understood 
it 
all! 
But 
what 
am 
I 
to 
do? 
Harness,
but 
how 
can 
I 
harness 
everything?" 
and 
Pierre 
felt 
with 
horror 
that 
the
meaning 
of 
all 
he 
had 
seen 
and 
thought 
in 
the 
dream 
had 
been 
destroyed.

The 
groom,<p>
the 
coachman, 
and 
the 
innkeeper 
told 
Pierre 
that 
an 
officer
had 
come 
with 
news 
that 
the 
French 
were 
already 
near 
Mozhaysk 
and 
that
our 
men 
were 
leaving 
it.

Pierre 
got 
up 
and, 
having 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ro24om6yYzh.html">told</a> 
them 
to 
harness 
and 
overtake 
him, 
went 
on
foot 
through 
the 
town.

The 
troops 
were 
moving 
on, 
leaving 
about 
ten 
thousand 
wounded 
behind
them. 
There 
were 
wounded 
in 
the 
yards, 
at 
the 
windows 
of 
the 
houses, 
and
the 
streets 
were 
crowded 
with 
them. 
In 
the 
streets, 
around 
carts 
that
were 
to 
take 
some 
of 
the 
wounded 
away, 
shouts, 
curses, 
and 
blows 
could
be 
heard. 
Pierre<p>
offered 
the 
use 
of 
his 
carriage, 
which 
had 
overtaken
him, 
to 
a 
wounded 
general 
he 
knew, 
and 
drove 
with 
him 
to 
Moscow. 
On 
the
way 
Pierre 
was 
told 
of 
the 
death 
of 
his 
brother-in-law 
Anatole 
and 
of
that 
of 
Prince 
Andrew.





CHAPTER 
X

On 
the 
thirtieth 
of 
August 
Pierre 
reached 
Moscow. 
Close 
to 
the 
gates 
of
the 
city 
he 
was 
met 
by 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
adjutant.

"We 
have 
been 
looking 
for 
you 
everywhere," 
said 
the 
adjutant. 
"The 
count
wants 
to 
see 
you 
particularly. 
He 
asks 
you 
to 
come 
to 
him 
at 
once 
on 
a
very 
important 
matter."

The

abruptly.

"Quite 
beside

Yakov 
Alpatych; 
they've 
fetched 
another
barrel."

"Well, 
then, 
listen! 
I'll 
go 
to 
the 
police 
officer, 
and 
you 
tell 
them
so, 
and 
that 
they

the 
carts

be

"I 
understand."

Alpatych 
did 
not 
insist 
further. 
He 
had 
managed 
people 
for 
a 
long 
time
and 
knew 
that 
the 
chief 
way 
to 
make 
them 
obey 
is 
to 
show 
no 
suspicion
that 
they 
can 
<a href="/cZl/mr5byQW9EbhW2vxtj.html">possibly</a> 
disobey. 
Having 
wrung 
a 
submissive 
"I

from 
Dron, 
Alpatych 
contented 
himself 
with 
that, 
though 
he 
not 
only
doubted 
but 
felt 
almost 
certain 
that 
without 
the 
help 
of 
troops 
the
carts 
would 
not 
be 
forthcoming.

And 
so 
it 
was, 
for 
when 
evening 
came 
no 
carts 
had 
been 
provided. 
In 
the
village, 
outside 
the

shop, 
another 
meeting 
was 
being 
held, 
which
decided 
that 
the

be 
driven 
out 
into

the

CHAPTER 
X

After 
her 
father's 
funeral 
Princess 
Mary 
shut 
herself 
up 
in<p>
her 
room 
and
did 
not 
admit 
anyone. 
A 
maid 
came 
to 
the 
door 
to 
say 
that 
Alpatych 
was
asking 
for 
orders 
about 
their 
departure. 
(This 
was 
before 
his 
talk 
with
Dron.) 
Princess 
Mary 
raised 
herself 
on 
the 
sofa 
on 
which 
she 
had 
been
lying 
and 
replied 
through 
the 
closed 
door 
that 
she 
did 
not 
mean 
to<p>
go
away 
and 
begged 
to 
be 
left 
in 
peace.

The 
windows 
of 
the 
room 
in 
which 
she 
was 
lying 
looked 
westward. 
She
lay 
on 
the 
sofa 
with 
her 
face 
to 
the 
wall, 
fingering 
the 
buttons<p>
of 
the
leather 
cushion 
and 
seeing 
nothing 
but 
that 
cushion, 
and 
her 
confused
thoughts 
were 
centered 
on 
one 
subject-the 
irrevocability 
of 
death 
and
her 
own 
spiritual 
baseness, 
which 
she 
had 
not 
suspected, 
but 
which 
had
shown 
itself 
during 
her 
father's 
illness. 
She 
wished 
to 
pray 
but 
did 
not
dare 
to, 
dared 
not 
in 
her 
present 
state 
of 
mind 
address 
herself 
to 
God.
She 
lay 
for 
a 
long 
time 
in 
that 
position.

The 
sun 
had 
reached 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
house, 
and 
its 
slanting 
rays
shone 
into 
the 
open 
window,

up 
the

of 
the

fancied 
the 
sovereign 
saying. 
And
passing 
people 
who 
looked 
after 
him 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/PX8PUEsy69.html">with</a> 
curiosity, 
he 
entered 
the 
porch
of 
the 
Emperor's 
house.

A 
broad 
staircase 
led 
straight 
up 
from 
the 
entry, 
and 
to 
the 
right 
he
saw 
a 
closed 
door. 
Below, 
under 
the 
staircase, 
was 
a 
door 
leading 
to 
the
lower 
floor.

"Whom 
do 
you 
want?" 
someone 
inquired.

"To 
hand 
in 
a 
letter, 
a 
petition, 
to 
His 
Majesty," 
said 
Nicholas,
with 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/UQ9sGG5O4Pm.html">tremor</a> 
in 
his 
voice.

"A

This

on 
duty" 
(he 
was 
shown 
the
door 
leading 
downstairs),<p>
"only 
it 
won't 
be 
accepted."

On 
hearing 
this 
indifferent 
voice, 
Rostov 
grew 
frightened 
at 
what
he 
was 
doing; 
the 
thought 
of 
meeting 
the 
Emperor 
at 
any 
moment 
was 
so
fascinating 
and 
consequently 
so 
alarming 
that 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
run 
away,
but 
the 
official 
who 
had 
questioned 
him 
opened 
the 
door, 
and 
Rostov
entered.

A 
short 
stout 
man 
of 
about 
thirty, 
in 
white 
breeches 
and 
high 
boots 
and
a 
batiste 
shirt 
that 
he

evidently 
only

put 
on,

in

buttoning 
on 
to 
the 
back 
of 
his 
breeches 
a
new 
pair 
of 
handsome 
silk-embroidered 
braces 
that, 
for 
some 
reason,
attracted 
Rostov's 
attention. 
This 
man 
was 
speaking 
to 
someone 
in 
the
adjoining 
room.

"A 
good 
figure 
and 
in 
her 
first 
bloom,"<p>
he 
was 
saying, 
but 
on 
seeing
Rostov, 
he 
stopped 
short 
and 
frowned.

"What 
is 
it? 
A 
petition?"

"What 
is 
it?" 
asked 
the 
person 
in 
the 
other 
room.

"Another 
petitioner," 
answered 
the 
man 
with 
the 
braces.

"Tell

"Later...

and

CHAPTER 
XI

Silence 
ensued. 
The 
countess 
looked 
at 
her 
callers, 
smiling 
affably,
but 
not 
concealing 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
would 
not 
be 
distressed 
if 
they
now 
rose 
and 
took 
their 
leave. 
The 
visitor's 
daughter 
was 
already
smoothing 
down 
her 
dress 
with 
an 
inquiring 
look 
at 
her 
mother, 
when
suddenly 
from 
the 
next 
room<p>
were 
heard 
the 
footsteps 
of 
boys 
and 
girls
running 
to 
the 
door 
and 
the 
noise 
of 
a 
chair 
falling 
over, 
and 
a 
girl
of 
thirteen, 
hiding<p>
something 
in 
the 
folds 
of 
her 
short 
muslin 
frock,
darted 
in 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/MLv29oRCc2bju.html">stopped</a> 
short 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room. 
It 
was 
evident
that 
she 
had 
not 
intended 
her 
flight 
to 
bring 
her 
so 
far. 
Behind 
her 
in
the

appeared 
a

with 
a

coat

an 
officer
of 
the 
Guards, 
a

fifteen, 
and 
a 
plump 
rosy-faced

in 
a 
short
jacket.

The 
count 
jumped 
up 
and, 
swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side, 
spread 
his 
arms 
wide
and 
threw 
them 
round 
the 
little 
girl 
who 
had 
run 
in.

"Ah, 
here 
she

Pierre 
often 
indulged 
in 
<a href="/cZl/KD5oL5uq7hyP.html">reflections</a> 
of<p>
this 
sort, 
nullifying
all 
his 
decisions 
and

He 
went 
to 
Kuragin's.

Reaching 
the 
large 
house 
near 
the 
Horse 
Guards' 
barracks, 
in 
which
Anatole 
lived, 
Pierre 
entered 
the 
lighted 
porch, 
ascended 
the 
stairs,
and 
went 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">in</a> 
at 
the 
open 
door. 
There 
was 
no 
one 
in 
the 
anteroom; 
empty
bottles, 
cloaks, 
and 
overshoes 
were 
lying 
about; 
there 
was 
a 
smell 
of
alcohol, 
and 
sounds 
of 
voices 
and 
shouting 
in 
the 
distance.

Cards 
and 
supper 
were 
over, 
but 
the 
visitors 
had 
not 
yet 
dispersed.
Pierre 
threw 
off 
his 
cloak 
and 
entered 
the 
first 
room, 
in 
which 
were 
the
remains 
of 
supper. 
A 
footman, 
thinking 
no 
one 
saw 
him, 
was 
drinking 
on
the 
sly 
what 
was 
left 
in 
the 
glasses. 
<a href="/aVzUge/SO90O9PUEsy.html">From</a> 
the

came 
sounds 
of
laughter, 
the 
shouting

familiar 
voices, 
the

of 
a

and
general 
commotion. 
Some 
eight 
or 
nine 
young 
men 
were 
crowding 
anxiously
round 
an 
open 
window. 
Three 
others 
were 
romping 
with 
a 
young 
bear, 
one
pulling 
him 
by 
the 
chain 
and 
trying 
to 
set 
him 
at 
the 
others.

"I

one.

"Mind,

another.

"I

a

"Kuragin,

"There,

"Dram-da-da-dam,

rattled

Pierre 
understood
that 
this 
mysterious 
force 
completely 
controlled 
these 
men 
and 
that 
it
was 
now 
useless 
to 
say 
any 
more.

The 
officer 
prisoners 
were 
separated 
from 
the 
soldiers 
and 
told 
to 
march
in 
front. 
There 
were 
about 
thirty 
officers, 
with 
Pierre 
among 
them, 
and
about 
three 
hundred 
men.

The 
officers, 
who 
had 
come 
from 
the 
other 
sheds, 
were 
all 
strangers 
to
Pierre 
and 
much 
better 
dressed<p>
than 
he. 
They 
looked 
at 
him 
and 
at 
his
shoes 
mistrustfully, 
as 
at 
an 
alien. 
Not 
far 
from 
him 
walked 
a 
fat 
major
with 
a 
sallow, 
bloated,

face,

round 
with 
a

and 
who 
evidently 
enjoyed 
the

of
his 
fellow

He 
kept 
one 
hand, 
in 
which 
he 
clasped 
his 
tobacco
pouch, 
inside 
the 
bosom 
of 
his 
dressing 
gown 
and 
held 
the 
stem 
of 
his
pipe 
firmly 
with 
the 
other. 
Panting 
and 
puffing, 
the 
major 
grumbled<p>
and
growled 
at 
everybody 
because 
he 
thought 
he<p>

that

and 
were
all

at 
something 
when 
there 
was 
nothing

Another, 
a 
thin

On 
the 
tenth 
of 
October 
when 
Dokhturov 
had 
gone 
halfway 
to 
Forminsk 
and
stopped 
at 
the 
village 
of 
Aristovo, 
preparing 
faithfully 
to 
execute 
the
orders 
he 
had 
received, 
the 
whole 
French 
army 
having,<p>
in 
its<p>
convulsive
movement, 
reached 
Murat's 
position 
apparently 
in 
order 
to 
give
battle-suddenly 
without 
any 
reason 
turned 
off 
to 
the 
left 
onto 
the 
new
Kaluga 
road 
and 
began 
to 
enter 
Forminsk, 
where 
only 
Broussier 
had
been 
till 
then. 
At 
that 
time 
Dokhturov 
had 
under 
his 
command, 
besides
Dorokhov's 
detachment, 
the 
two 
small 
guerrilla 
detachments 
of 
Figner 
and
Seslavin.

On 
the 
evening 
of 
October 
11 
Seslavin 
came 
to 
the 
Aristovo 
headquarters
with 
a 
French 
guardsman 
he 
had 
captured. 
The 
prisoner 
said 
that 
the
troops 
that 
had 
entered 
Forminsk 
that 
day 
were 
the 
vanguard 
of 
the 
whole
army, 
that 
Napoleon 
was 
there 
and 
the 
whole 
army 
had 
left 
Moscow 
four
days 
previously. 
That 
same 
evening 
a 
house 
serf 
who 
had 
come 
from
Borovsk 
said 
he 
had 
seen 
an 
immense 
army 
entering 
the 
town. 
Some
Cossacks 
of 
Dokhturov's 
detachment 
reported 
having 
sighted 
the 
French
Guards 
marching 
along 
the 
road 
to 
Borovsk. 
From 
all 
these 
reports 
it 
was
evident 
that 
where 
they 
had 
expected 
to 
meet 
a 
single 
division 
there
was 
now 
the 
whole 
French 
army 
marching 
from 
Moscow 
in 
an 
unexpected
direction-along 
the 
Kaluga 
road. 
Dokhturov 
was 
unwilling 
to 
undertake
any 
action, 
as 
it 
was 
not 
clear 
to 
him 
now 
what 
he 
ought 
to 
do. 
He 
had
been 
ordered 
to 
attack 
Forminsk. 
But 
only 
Broussier 
had 
been 
<a href="/cZl/HG89CBzhL.html">there</a> 
at
that 
time 
and 
now 
the 
whole

was 
there. 
Ermolov 
wished 
to 
act
on 
his 
own 
judgment, 
but 
<a href="/cZl/nHL70tvJE6nrOP.html">Dokhturov</a> 
insisted 
that 
he 
must 
have 
Kutuzov's
instructions. 
So 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
send 
a 
dispatch 
to 
the 
staff.

For 
this 
purpose 
a 
capable 
officer, 
Bolkhovitinov, 
was 
chosen, 
who
was 
to 
explain 
the 
whole 
affair 
by 
word 
of 
mouth, 
besides 
delivering
a 
written 
report. 
Toward 
midnight 
Bolkhovitinov, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak7z7iY0e.html">having</a> 
received 
the
dispatch 
and

It 
was<p>

And

is 
the

that

when 
a 
rational

for
the 
connection 
between 
those 
men 
and 
the 
nations 
has 
not 
been 
found.
The 
theory 
that 
this 
connection 
is 
based 
on 
the 
transference 
of 
the
collective 
will 
of 
a 
people 
to 
certain 
historical 
personages 
is 
an
hypothesis 
unconfirmed<p>
by 
the 
experience 
of 
history.

The 
theory 
of 
the 
transference 
of 
the 
collective 
will 
of 
the 
people 
to
historic 
persons 
may 
perhaps 
explain 
much 
in 
the 
domain 
of 
jurisprudence
and 
be 
essential 
for 
its 
purposes, 
but 
in 
its 
application 
to 
history, 
as
soon 
as 
revolutions, 
conquests, 
or 
civil 
wars 
occur-that 
is, 
as 
soon 
as
history 
begins-that 
theory 
explains 
nothing.

The 
theory 
seems 
irrefutable 
just<p>
because 
the 
act 
of 
transference 
of 
the
people's 
will 
cannot 
be 
verified, 
for 
it 
never 
occurred.

Whatever 
happens 
and 
whoever 
may 
stand 
at 
the 
head 
of 
affairs, 
the
theory 
can 
always 
say 
that 
such 
and 
such 
a 
person 
took 
the 
lead 
because
the 
collective 
will 
was 
transferred 
to 
him.

The 
replies 
this 
theory 
gives 
to 
historical 
questions 
are 
like 
the
replies 
of 
a 
man 
who, 
watching 
the 
movements 
of 
a 
herd 
of 
cattle 
and
paying 
no 
attention 
to 
the 
varying 
quality 
of 
the 
pasturage 
in 
different
parts 
of 
the 
field, 
or 
to 
the 
driving 
of 
the 
herdsman, 
should 
attribute
the 
direction 
the 
herd 
takes 
to 
what 
animal 
happens 
to 
be 
at 
its 
head.

"The 
herd 
goes 
in 
that 
direction 
because 
the 
animal 
in 
front 
leads
it 
and 
the 
collective 
will 
of 
all 
the 
other 
animals 
is 
vested 
in<p>
that
leader." 
This 
is 
what 
historians 
of 
the 
first 
class 
say-those 
who 
assume
the 
unconditional 
transference 
of 
the 
people's 
will.

"If 
the 
animals 
leading 
the 
herd 
<a href="/cZl/io9bKMVG1gcFtr4IEXzL.html">change,</a> 
this 
happens 
because 
the
collective 
will 
of 
all 
the 
animals 
is 
transferred 
from 
one 
leader 
to
another, 
according 
to 
whether 
the 
animal 
is 
or 
is 
not 
leading 
them 
in
the 
direction 
selected 
by 
the 
whole 
herd." 
Such 
is 
the 
reply 
historians
who 
assume 
that

two
soldiers,

carried

Ramballe 
put

leaned

Meanwhile 
Morel 
was 
sitting 
in 
the 
best 
place 
by 
the 
fire, 
surrounded 
by
the 
soldiers.

Morel,<p>
a 
short 
sturdy 
Frenchman 
with 
inflamed 
and 
streaming 
eyes, 
was
wearing 
a 
woman's 
cloak 
and 
had 
a 
shawl 
tied 
woman 
fashion 
round 
his
head 
over 
his 
cap. 
He 
was 
evidently 
tipsy,

was 
singing 
a 
French 
song
in 
a 
hoarse 
broken 
voice, 
with 
an<p>
arm 
thrown 
round 
the 
nearest 
soldier.
The 
soldiers 
simply 
held 
their 
sides 
as 
they 
watched

"Now

how

How

said 
the 
man-a 
singer 
and 
a 
wag-whom 
Morel 
was 
embracing.

"Vive 
Henri 
Quatre! 
Vive

roi 
valiant!" 
sang 
Morel, 
winking. 
"Ce

"Long

"Bravo!

went 
into 
the 
maids' 
room. 
There 
an 
old 
maidservant 
was 
grumbling 
at
a 
young 
girl 
who 
stood 
panting, 
having 
just 
run 
in 
through 
the 
cold 
from
the 
serfs' 
quarters.

"Stop 
playing-there's 
a 
time 
for 
everything," 
said 
the 
old
woman.

"Let 
her 
alone, 
Kondratevna," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Go, 
Mavrushka,
go."

Having 
released 
Mavrushka, 
Natasha 
crossed 
the 
dancing 
hall 
and 
went
to 
the 
vestibule. 
There 
an 
old 
footman 
and 
two 
young 
ones 
were 
playing
cards. 
They 
broke 
off 
and 
rose 
as 
she 
entered.

"What 
can<p>
I 
do 
with 
them?" 
thought 
Natasha.

"Oh, 
Nikita, 
please 
go... 
where 
can 
I 
send

Yes, 
go 
to 
the

a

you, 
Misha,

<a href="/aVzUge/bj5pWxqu9.html">some

"Just</a> 
a 
few 
oats?" 
said 
Misha, 
cheerfully 
and 
readily.

"Go, 
go 
quickly," 
the 
old 
man 
urged 
him.

"And 
you, 
Theodore, 
get 
me 
a 
piece 
of 
chalk."

On 
her 
way 
past 
the 
butler's 
pantry 
she 
told 
them 
to 
set 
a 
samovar,
though 
it 
was 
not 
at 
all 
the 
time 
for 
tea.

Foka, 
the 
butler, 
was 
the 
most 
ill-tempered 
person 
in 
the 
house.
Natasha 
liked 
to 
test 
her 
power 
over 
him. 
He 
distrusted 
the 
order 
and
asked 
whether 
the 
samovar 
was 
really 
wanted.

"Oh 
dear, 
what 
a 
young 
lady!" 
said 
Foka, 
pretending 
to 
frown 
at
Natasha.

No 
one 
in 
the 
house 
sent 
people 
about 
or 
gave 
them 
as 
much 
trouble 
as
Natasha 
did. 
She 
could 
not 
see 
people 
unconcernedly, 
but 
had 
to 
send
them 
on 
some 
errand. 
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
trying<p>
whether 
any 
of 
them 
would
get 
angry 
or 
sulky 
with 
her; 
but 
the 
serfs 
fulfilled 
no 
one's 
orders
so 
readily 
as 
they 
did 
hers. 
"What 
can 
I 
do, 
where 
can 
I 
go?"
thought 
she, 
as 
she 
went 
slowly 
along 
the 
passage.

"Nastasya 
Ivanovna, 
what 
sort 
of 
children 
shall 
I 
have?" 
she 
asked
the 
buffoon, 
who 
was 
coming 
toward 
her 
in 
a 
woman's 
jacket.

"Why, 
fleas, 
crickets, 
grasshoppers," 
answered 
the 
buffoon.

"O 
Lord, 
O 
Lord, 
it's 
always 
the 
same! 
Oh, 
where 
am 
I 
to 
go? 
What
am 
I 
to 
do 
with 
myself?" 
And 
tapping 
with 
her 
heels, 
she 
ran 
quickly
upstairs 
to 
see 
Vogel 
and 
his 
wife 
who 
lived 
on 
the 
upper 
story.

Two 
governesses 
were 
sitting 
with 
the 
Vogels 
at 
a 
table, 
on 
which 
were
plates 
of 
raisins, 
walnuts, 
and 
almonds. 
The 
governesses 
were 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oq7hpfx9gJL.html">discussing
whether</a> 
it 
was 
cheaper 
to 
live 
in 
Moscow 
or 
Odessa. 
Natasha 
sat 
down,
listened 
to 
their 
talk 
with 
a 
serious 
and 
thoughtful 
air, 
and 
then 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">got
up</a> 
again.

"The 
island 
of 
Madagascar," 
she 
said,

she
repeated, 
articulating 
each 
syllable 
distinctly, 
and, 
not 
replying<p>
to
Madame 
Schoss 
who 
asked 
her 
what 
she 
was 
saying, 
she 
went 
out 
of 
the
room.

Her 
brother 
Petya 
was 
upstairs 
too; 
with 
the 
man 
in 
attendance 
on 
him
he 
was 
preparing 
fireworks 
to 
let 
off 
that 
night.

"Petya! 
Petya!" 
she 
called 
to 
him. 
"Carry 
me 
downstairs."

Petya 
ran 
up 
and 
offered 
her 
his 
back.<p>
She 
jumped 
on 
it, 
putting 
her
arms 
round 
his 
neck, 
and 
he 
pranced 
along 
with 
her.

"No, 
don't... 
the 
island 
of 
Madagascar!" 
she 
said, 
and 
jumping 
off
his 
back 
she 
went 
downstairs.

Having 
as 
it 
were 
reviewed 
her 
kingdom, 
tested 
her 
power, 
and 
made
sure 
that 
everyone 
was 
submissive, 
but 
that 
all 
the 
same 
it 
was 
dull,
Natasha 
betook 
herself 
to 
the 
ballroom, 
picked 
up 
her 
guitar, 
sat 
down
in 
a 
dark 
corner 
behind 
a 
bookcase, 
and 
began 
to 
run 
her 
fingers 
over
the 
strings 
in 
the 
bass, 
picking 
out 
a 
passage 
she 
<a href="/cZl/FvO6hai1bvg.html">recalled</a> 
from 
an
opera 
she 
had 
heard 
in 
Petersburg 
with

Andrew. 
What 
she 
drew 
from
the 
guitar 
would 
have 
had 
no 
meaning 
for 
other 
listeners, 
but 
in 
her
imagination 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
reminiscences 
arose 
from 
those 
sounds.
She 
sat 
behind 
the 
bookcase 
with 
her 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
a 
streak 
of 
light
escaping 
from 
the 
pantry 
door 
and 
listened 
to 
herself 
and 
pondered. 
She
was 
in 
a 
mood 
for 
brooding 
on 
the 
past.

Sonya 
passed 
to 
the 
pantry 
with 
a 
glass 
in 
her 
hand. 
Natasha 
glanced
at 
her 
and 
at 
the 
crack 
in 
the

door, 
and 
it 
seemed 
to 
her 
that

You

about

Tell 
General 
Barclay 
from 
me 
that 
his 
information
is 
incorrect 
and 
that 
the 
real 
course 
of 
the 
battle 
is 
better 
known 
to

the 
commander 
in

than 
to 
him."

Wolzogen 
was 
about 
to 
make 
a 
rejoinder, 
but 
Kutuzov 
interrupted 
him.

"The 
enemy 
has 
been 
repulsed 
on 
the 
left 
and 
defeated 
on 
the 
right
flank. 
If 
you 
have 
seen 
amiss, 
sir, 
do 
not 
allow 
yourself 
to 
say 
what
you 
don't 
know! 
Be 
so 
good 
as 
to 
ride 
to 
General 
Barclay 
and 
inform
him 
of 
my 
firm 
intention 
to 
attack 
the 
enemy 
tomorrow," 
said 
Kutuzov
sternly.

All 
were 
silent, 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">and</a> 
the 
only 
sound 
audible 
was 
the 
heavy 
breathing 
of
the 
panting 
old 
general.

"They 
are 
repulsed 
everywhere, 
for 
which 
I 
thank 
God 
and 
our 
brave 
army!
The 
enemy 
is 
beaten, 
and 
tomorrow 
we 
shall 
drive 
him 
from 
the 
sacred
soil 
of 
Russia," 
said 
Kutuzov 
crossing 
himself, 
and 
he 
suddenly 
sobbed
as 
his 
eyes 
filled 
with 
tears.

Wolzogen, 
shrugging 
his 
shoulders 
and 
curling 
his 
lips, 
stepped 
silently
aside, 
marveling 
at 
"the 
old 
gentleman's" 
conceited 
stupidity.

"Ah,<p>
here 
he 
is, 
my 
hero!" 
said 
Kutuzov 
to 
a 
portly, 
handsome,
dark-haired 
general 
who 
was 
just 
ascending 
the 
knoll.

This 
was 
Raevski, 
who<p>
had 
spent 
the 
whole 
day 
at 
the 
most 
important 
part
of 
the 
field 
of 
Borodino.

Raevski 
reported 
that 
the 
troops 
were 
firmly 
holding 
their 
ground 
and
that 
the 
French 
no 
longer 
ventured 
to 
attack.

After 
hearing 
him, 
Kutuzov 
said 
in 
French:

"Then 
you 
do 
not 
think, 
like 
some 
others, 
that 
we 
must 
retreat?"

"On 
the 
contrary, 
your<p>
Highness, 
in 
indecisive 
actions 
it 
is 
always
the 
most 
stubborn 
who 
remain 
victors," 
replied 
Raevski, 
"and 
in 
my
opinion..."

"Kaysarov!" 
Kutuzov 
called 
to 
his 
adjutant. 
"Sit 
down 
and 
write 
out
the 
order 
of 
the 
day 
for 
tomorrow. 
And 
you," 
he 
continued, 
addressing
another, 
"ride 
along 
the 
line 
and 
announce 
that 
tomorrow 
we 
attack."

While 
Kutuzov 
was 
talking 
to 
Raevski 
and 
dictating 
the 
order 
of 
the 
day,
Wolzogen 
returned 
from 
Barclay 
and 
said 
that 
General 
Barclay 
wished 
to
have 
written 
confirmation 
of 
the 
order 
the 
field 
marshal 
had 
given.

Kutuzov, 
without 
looking 
at<p>
Wolzogen, 
gave 
directions 
for 
the 
order 
to
be<p>
written 
out 
which 
the 
former 
commander 
in 
chief, 
to 
avoid 
personal
responsibility, 
very 
judiciously 
wished 
to 
receive.

And 
by 
means 
of 
that 
mysterious 
indefinable 
bond 
which 
maintains
throughout 
an 
army 
one 
and 
the 
same 
temper, 
known 
as 
"the 
spirit 
of
the 
army," 
and 
which 
constitutes 
the 
sinew 
of 
war, 
Kutuzov's 
words, 
his
order 
for 
a 
battle 
next 
day, 
immediately 
became 
known 
from 
one 
end 
of
the 
army 
to 
the 
other.

It 
was 
far 
from 
being 
the 
same 
words 
or 
the 
same 
order 
that 
reached 
the
farthest 
links 
of 
that 
chain. 
The 
tales 
passing 
from 
mouth 
to 
mouth 
at
different 
ends 
of 
the 
army 
did 
not 
even 
resemble 
what 
Kutuzov 
had 
said,
but 
the 
sense 
of 
his 
words 
spread 
everywhere 
because 
what 
he 
said 
was
not 
the 
outcome 
of 
cunning 
calculations, 
but 
of 
a 
feeling 
that

was 
clear 
and 
frosty. 
Above

dirty, 
ill-lit

above

sordid

humiliating 
were 
all 
mundane
things 
compared 
with 
the 
heights 
to 
which

just 
been 
raised.
At 
the

an 
immense

the

In

that

On

From

merry 
voices 
trying

The

at 
her 
silent 
son.

"What 
is

she 
asked.

"Oh, 
nothing," 
said 
he, 
as 
if 
weary 
of 
being 
continually 
asked 
the
same 
question. 
"Will 
Papa 
be 
back 
soon?"

"I 
expect 
so."

"Everything's 
the

They

Where

Nicholas, 
and 
went 
again 
into 
the 
dancing 
room
where 
the 
clavichord 
stood.

Sonya 
was 
sitting 
at 
the 
clavichord, 
playing 
the 
prelude 
to
Denisov's 
favorite 
barcarolle. 
Natasha 
was 
preparing 
to 
sing.
Denisov 
was 
looking 
at 
her 
with 
enraptured 
eyes.

Nicholas 
began 
pacing 
up 
and 
down 
the

"Why

Sonya 
struck 
the 
first 
chord 
of 
the

ran

"Go

He 
continued 
to 
pace 
the

looking 
gloomily 
at 
Denisov 
and 
the
girls 
and 
avoiding 
their

"Nikolenka, 
what 
is 
the

Sonya's 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
him
seemed 
to 
ask. 
She 
noticed 
at 
once 
that 
something 
had 
happened 
to 
him.

Nicholas 
turned 
away 
from 
her. 
Natasha 
too, 
with 
her 
quick 
instinct,
had 
instantly 
noticed 
her 
brother's 
condition. 
But, 
though 
she 
noticed
it, 
she<p>
was 
herself 
in 
such 
high 
spirits 
at 
that 
moment, 
so 
far 
from
sorrow, 
sadness, 
or 
self-reproach, 
that 
she 
purposely 
deceived 
herself
as 
young 
people 
often 
do. 
"No, 
I 
am<p>
too 
happy 
now 
to 
spoil 
my
enjoyment 
by 
sympathy<p>
with 
anyone's 
sorrow," 
she 
felt, 
and 
she 
said
to 
herself: 
"No, 
I 
must 
be 
mistaken, 
he 
must 
be 
feeling 
happy, 
just 
as
I 
am."

"Now, 
Sonya!" 
she 
said, 
going 
to 
the 
very 
middle 
of 
the 
room, 
where
she 
considered 
the 
resonance 
was 
best.

Having 
lifted 
her 
head 
and 
let 
her 
arms 
droop 
lifelessly, 
as 
ballet
dancers 
do, 
Natasha, 
rising 
energetically 
from 
her 
heels 
to 
her 
toes,
stepped 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the

drawing

CHAPTER 
II

Anna 
Pavlovna's 
drawing 
room 
was 
gradually 
filling. 
The 
highest
Petersburg 
society 
was 
assembled 
there: 
people 
differing 
widely 
in<p>
age
and 
character 
but 
alike 
in 
the 
social 
circle 
to 
which 
they 
belonged.
Prince 
Vasili's 
daughter, 
the 
beautiful 
Helene, 
came 
to 
take 
her
father 
to 
the 
ambassador's 
entertainment; 
she 
wore 
a 
ball 
dress 
and
her 
badge 
as 
maid 
of 
honor. 
The 
youthful 
little 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya,
known 
as 
la 
femme<p>
la 
plus 
seduisante 
de 
Petersbourg, 
* 
was 
also 
there.
She 
had 
been 
married 
during 
the 
previous 
winter, 
and 
being 
pregnant 
did
not 
go 
to 
any 
large 
gatherings, 
but 
only 
to 
small 
receptions. 
Prince
Vasili's 
son, 
Hippolyte, 
had 
come 
with 
Mortemart, 
whom 
he 
introduced.
The 
Abbe 
Morio 
and 
many 
others 
had 
also 
come.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
The 
most 
fascinating 
woman 
in 
Petersburg.

To 
each 
new 
arrival 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
said, 
"You 
have 
not 
yet 
seen 
my
aunt," 
or 
"You 
do 
not 
know 
my 
aunt?" 
and 
very 
gravely 
conducted
him 
or 
her 
to 
a 
little 
old 
lady, 
wearing 
large 
bows 
of 
ribbon 
in 
her
cap, 
who 
had 
come 
sailing 
in 
from 
another 
room 
as 
soon 
as 
the 
guests
began 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/HB95NtgpO1Xs.html">arrive;</a> 
and 
slowly 
turning 
her 
eyes 
from 
the 
visitor 
to 
her
aunt, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
mentioned 
each<p>
one's 
name 
and 
then 
left 
them.

Each 
visitor 
performed 
the 
ceremony 
of 
greeting 
this 
old 
aunt 
whom 
not
one 
of 
them 
knew, 
not 
one 
of 
them 
wanted 
to 
know, 
and 
not 
one 
of 
them
cared 
about; 
Anna 
<a href="/cZl/eQ3XKBx4M6HrPAf.html">Pavlovna</a> 
observed 
these 
greetings 
with 
mournful 
and
solemn 
interest 
and 
silent 
approval. 
The 
aunt 
spoke 
to 
each 
of 
them 
in
the 
same 
words, 
about 
their 
health 
and 
her 
own, 
and 
the 
health 
of 
Her
Majesty, 
"who, 
thank 
God, 
was 
better 
today." 
And 
each 
visitor,
though 
politeness 
prevented 
his 
showing 
impatience, 
left 
the 
old 
woman
with 
a 
sense 
of 
relief 
at 
having 
performed 
a 
vexatious 
duty 
and 
did 
not
return 
to 
her 
the 
whole 
evening.

The 
young 
Princess 
Bolkonskaya 
had 
brought 
some 
work 
in 
a
gold-embroidered 
velvet 
bag. 
Her 
pretty 
little 
upper 
lip, 
on 
which 
a
delicate 
dark 
down 
was 
just 
perceptible, 
was 
too 
short 
for 
her 
teeth,
but 
it 
lifted 
all 
the 
more 
sweetly, 
and

CHAPTER 
IX

At 
that 
time, 
as 
always 
happens, 
the 
highest 
society 
that 
met 
at 
court
and 
at 
the 
grand 
balls 
was 
divided 
into 
several 
circles, 
each 
with 
its
own 
particular 
tone. 
The 
largest 
of 
these 
was 
the 
French 
circle 
of 
the
Napoleonic 
alliance, 
the 
circle 
of 
Count 
Rumyantsev 
and 
Caulaincourt.
In 
this 
group

as 
she 
had

and 
noticing 
that
his 
conclusion 
was 
weaker 
than 
what 
had 
gone 
before, 
he 
added 
quickly:
"There

Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
wine 
he 
had 
drunk, 
and 
after 
the 
days 
he 
had
spent 
alone 
with 
his 
depressing 
thoughts, 
Pierre 
involuntarily 
enjoyed
talking 
with 
this 
cheerful 
and 
good-natured 
man.

"To 
return 
to 
your 
ladies-I<p>
hear 
they 
are 
lovely. 
What 
a 
wretched 
idea
to 
go 
and 
bury 
themselves 
in 
the 
steppes 
when 
the 
French 
army 
is 
in
Moscow. 
What 
a 
chance 
those 
girls 
have 
missed! 
Your 
peasants, 
now-that's
another 
thing; 
but 
you 
civilized 
people, 
you 
ought 
to 
know 
us 
better
than 
that. 
We 
took 
Vienna, 
Berlin, 
Madrid, 
Naples, 
Rome, 
Warsaw, 
all
the 
world's 
capitals.... 
We 
are 
feared, 
but 
we 
are 
loved. 
We 
are 
nice 
to
know. 
And 
then 
the 
Emperor..." 
he 
began, 
but 
Pierre 
interrupted 
him.

"The 
Emperor," 
Pierre 
repeated, 
and 
his 
face 
suddenly 
became 
sad 
and
embarrassed, 
"is 
the 
Emperor...?"

"The 
Emperor? 
He 
is 
generosity, 
mercy, 
justice, 
order, 
genius-that's
what 
the 
Emperor 
is! 
It 
is 
I, 
Ramballe, 
who 
tell 
you 
so.... 
I 
assure 
you
I 
was 
his 
enemy 
eight 
years 
ago. 
My 
father 
was 
an 
emigrant 
count.... 
But
that 
man 
has 
vanquished 
me. 
He 
has 
taken 
hold 
of 
me. 
I 
could 
not 
resist
the 
sight 
of 
the 
grandeur 
and 
glory 
with 
which 
he 
has<p>
covered 
France.
When 
I 
understood 
what 
he 
wanted-when 
I 
saw 
that 
he 
was 
preparing 
a 
bed
of 
laurels 
for 
us, 
you 
know, 
I 
said 
to 
myself: 
'That 
is 
a 
monarch,' 
and
I 
devoted 
myself 
to 
him! 
So 
there! 
Oh 
yes, 
mon 
cher, 
he 
is 
the 
greatest
man 
of 
the 
ages 
past 
or 
future."

"Is 
he 
in 
Moscow?" 
Pierre 
stammered 
with 
a 
guilty 
look.

The 
Frenchman 
looked 
at 
his 
guilty 
face 
and 
smiled.

"No, 
he 
will 
make 
his 
entry 
tomorrow," 
he 
replied, 
and 
continued 
his
talk.

Their 
conversation 
was 
interrupted 
by 
the 
cries 
of 
several 
voices 
at
the 
gate 
and 
by 
Morel, 
who 
came 
to 
say

Isn't</h1>that

Yes, 
very 
noble? 
Isn't 
it?"
asked 
Natasha, 
so 
seriously 
and 
excitedly 
that 
it 
was 
evident 
that 
what
she 
was 
now 
saying 
she 
had 
talked 
of 
before, 
with 
tears.

Rostov 
became 
thoughtful.

"I 
never 
go 
back 
on 
my 
word," 
he<p>
said. 
"Besides, 
Sonya 
is 
so
charming 
that 
only 
a 
fool 
would 
renounce 
such<p>
happiness."

"No, 
no!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
"she 
and 
I 
have 
already 
talked 
it 
over.
We 
knew 
you'd 
say 
so. 
But 
it 
won't 
do, 
because 
you 
see, 
if 
you 
say
that-if 
you 
consider 
yourself 
bound<p>
by 
your 
promise-it 
will 
seem 
as
if 
she 
had 
not 
meant 
it 
seriously. 
It 
makes 
it 
as 
if 
you 
were 
marrying
her 
because 
you 
must, 
and 
that 
wouldn't 
do 
at 
all."

Rostov 
saw 
that 
it 
had 
been 
well 
considered 
by 
them. 
Sonya 
had 
already
struck 
him 
by 
her 
beauty 
on 
the 
preceding 
day. 
Today, 
when 
he 
had 
caught
a 
glimpse 
of 
her, 
she 
seemed 
still 
more 
lovely. 
She 
was 
a 
charming 
girl
of 
sixteen, 
evidently 
passionately 
in 
love 
with 
him 
(he 
did 
not 
doubt
that 
for 
an 
instant). 
Why 
should 
he 
not 
love<p>
her 
now, 
and 
even 
marry
her, 
Rostov 
thought, 
but 
just 
now 
there 
were 
so 
many 
other 
pleasures
and 
interests 
before 
<a href="/aVzUge/If8vZzpo5O4ZUI.html">him!</a> 
"Yes, 
they 
have 
taken 
a 
wise 
decision," 
he
thought, 
"I 
must 
remain 
free."

"Well 
then,<p>
that's 
excellent," 
said 
he. 
"We'll 
talk 
it 
over
later 
on. 
Oh, 
how 
glad 
I 
am 
to 
have 
you!"

"Well, 
and 
are 
you 
still 
true 
to 
Boris?" 
he 
continued.

"Oh, 
what 
nonsense!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
laughing. 
"I 
don't 
think
about 
him 
or 
anyone 
else, 
and 
I 
don't 
want 
anything 
of 
the 
kind."

"Dear 
me! 
Then 
what 
are 
you 
up 
to 
now?"

"Now?" 
repeated 
Natasha, 
and 
a 
happy 
smile 
lit 
up 
her 
face. 
"Have
you 
seen 
Duport?"

"No."

"Not 
seen 
Duport-the 
famous 
dancer?<p>
Well 
then, 
you 
won't
understand. 
That's 
what 
I'm 
up 
to."

Curving 
her 
arms, 
Natasha 
held 
out 
her 
skirts 
as 
dancers 
do, 
ran 
back
a 
few 
steps, 
turned, 
cut 
a 
caper, 
brought 
her 
little 
feet 
sharply
together, 
and 
made 
some 
steps 
on 
the 
very 
tips 
of 
her 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eo4YfX8yG2mrwmb.html">toes.

"See,</a> 
I'm 
standing! 
See!" 
she 
said, 
but 
could 
not 
maintain 
herself
on 
her 
toes 
any 
longer. 
"So 
that's 
what 
I'm 
up 
to! 
I'll 
never
marry 
anyone, 
but 
will 
be 
a 
dancer.<p>
Only 
don't 
tell 
anyone."

Rostov 
laughed 
so 
loud 
and 
merrily 
that 
Denisov, 
in 
his 
bedroom, 
felt
envious 
and 
Natasha 
could 
not 
help 
joining 
in.

"No, 
but 
don't 
you 
think 
it's 
nice?" 
she 
kept 
repeating.

"Nice! 
And 
so 
you 
no 
longer 
wish 
to 
marry 
Boris?"

Natasha 
flared 
up. 
"I 
don't 
want 
to 
marry 
anyone. 
And 
I'll 
tell
him 
so 
when 
I 
see 
him!"

"Dear 
me!" 
said 
Rostov.

"But 
that's 
all 
rubbish," 
Natasha 
chattered 
on. 
"And 
is
Denisov 
nice?" 
she 
asked.

"Yes, 
indeed!"

"Oh, 
well 
then, 
good-by: 
go 
and 
dress. 
Is 
he 
very 
terrible,
Denisov?"

"Why 
terrible?" 
asked 
Nicholas. 
"No, 
Vaska 
is 
a 
splendid
fellow."

"You 
call 
him 
Vaska? 
That's 
funny! 
And 
is 
he 
very 
nice?"

"Very."

"Well 
then, 
be 
quick. 
We'll 
all 
have 
breakfast 
together."

And 
Natasha 
rose 
and 
went 
out 
of 
the 
room 
on 
tiptoe, 
like 
a 
ballet
dancer, 
but 
<a href="/aVzUge/Kt5f6QJprO0sGG.html">smiling</a> 
as 
only 
happy 
girls 
of 
fifteen 
can 
smile. 
When
Rostov 
met 
Sonya 
in 
the 
drawing 
room, 
he 
reddened. 
He 
did 
not 
know
how 
to 
behave 
with 
her. 
The 
evening 
before, 
in 
the 
first 
happy 
moment 
of
meeting, 
they 
had 
kissed 
<a href="/cZl/Gb4w0Cr6rJpLp.html">each</a> 
other,<p>
but 
today 
they 
felt 
it 
could 
not
be 
done; 
he 
felt 
that 
everybody, 
including 
his 
mother 
and

we

either 
complete 
freedom 
or
complete 
necessity.

(1) 
To 
whatever 
degree 
we 
may 
imagine 
a 
man 
to 
be 
exempt 
from 
the
influence<p>
of 
the 
external 
world, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom
in 
space. 
Every 
human 
action 
is 
inevitably 
conditioned 
by 
what<p>
surrounds
him 
and 
by 
his 
own 
body. 
I 
lift 
my 
arm 
and 
let 
it 
fall. 
My 
action 
seems
to 
me 
free; 
but 
asking 
myself 
whether 
I 
could 
raise 
my 
arm 
in 
every
direction, 
I 
see 
that 
I 
raised 
it 
in 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
there 
was
least 
obstruction 
to 
that 
action 
either 
from 
things 
around 
me 
or 
from
the 
construction 
of 
my 
own 
body. 
I 
chose 
one 
out 
of 
all 
the 
possible
directions 
because 
in 
it 
there 
were 
fewest 
obstacles. 
For 
my 
action
to 
be 
free 
it 
was 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
encounter 
no 
obstacles. 
To
conceive 
of 
a 
man 
being 
free 
we 
must 
imagine 
him 
outside 
space, 
which 
is
evidently 
impossible.

(2) 
However 
much 
we 
approximate 
the 
time 
of 
judgment 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the
deed, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom 
in 
time. 
For 
if 
I 
examine
an 
action 
committed 
a 
second 
ago 
I 
must 
still 
recognize 
it 
as 
not
being 
free, 
for 
it 
is 
irrevocably 
linked 
to 
the 
moment 
at 
which 
it 
was
committed. 
Can 
I 
lift 
my 
arm? 
I 
lift 
it, 
but 
ask 
myself: 
could 
I 
have
abstained 
from 
lifting 
my 
arm 
at 
the 
moment 
that 
has 
already 
passed? 
To
convince 
myself 
of 
this 
I 
do 
not 
lift 
it 
the 
next 
moment. 
But 
I 
am
not 
now 
abstaining 
from 
doing 
so 
at 
the 
first 
moment 
when 
I 
asked 
the
question. 
Time 
has 
gone 
by 
which 
I 
could 
not 
detain, 
the 
arm 
I 
then
lifted 
is 
no 
longer 
the 
same 
as 
the 
arm 
I 
now 
refrain 
from 
lifting,
nor 
is 
the 
air 
in 
which 
I 
lifted 
it 
the 
same 
that 
now 
surrounds 
me. 
The
moment 
in 
which 
the 
first 
movement 
was 
made 
is 
irrevocable, 
and 
at 
that
moment 
I 
could 
make 
only 
one 
movement,<p>
and 
whatever 
movement 
I 
made
would 
be 
the 
only 
one. 
That 
I 
did 
not 
lift 
my 
arm 
a 
moment 
later 
does
not 
prove 
that 
I 
could 
have 
abstained 
from 
lifting 
it 
then. 
And 
since 
I
could 
make 
only 
one 
movement 
at 
that 
single 
moment 
of 
time, 
it 
could 
not
have 
been 
any 
other. 
To 
imagine 
it 
as 
free, 
it 
is 
necessary 
to 
imagine
it 
in 
the 
present, 
on 
the 
boundary 
between 
the 
past 
and 
the 
future-that
is, 
outside 
time, 
which 
is 
impossible.

(3) 
However 
much 
the 
difficulty 
of 
understanding 
the 
causes 
may 
be
increased, 
we<p>
never 
reach 
a 
conception 
of 
complete 
freedom, 
that 
is,
an 
absence 
of 
cause. 
However 
inaccessible 
to 
us 
may 
be 
the 
cause 
of 
the
expression 
of 
will 
in 
any 
action,<p>
our 
own 
or 
another's, 
the 
first 
demand
of 
reason 
is 
the 
assumption 
of 
and 
search 
for 
a 
cause, 
for 
without 
a
cause 
no 
phenomenon 
is 
conceivable. 
I 
raise 
my 
arm 
to 
perform 
an 
action
independently 
of 
any 
cause, 
but 
my 
wish 
to 
perform 
an 
action 
without 
a
cause 
is 
the 
cause 
of 
my 
action.

But 
even 
if-imagining 
a 
man 
quite 
exempt 
from 
all 
influences, 
examining
only 
his 
momentary 
action 
in 
the 
present, 
unevoked 
by 
any 
cause-we 
were
to 
admit 
so 
infinitely 
small 
a 
remainder 
of 
inevitability 
as 
equaled
zero, 
we 
should 
even 
then 
not 
have 
arrived 
at 
the 
conception 
of 
complete
freedom 
in 
man, 
for 
a 
being 
uninfluenced 
by 
the 
external 
world, 
standing
outside 
of 
time 
and 
independent 
of 
cause, 
is 
no 
longer 
a 
man.

In 
the 
same 
way 
we 
can 
never 
imagine 
the 
action 
of 
a 
man 
quite 
devoid 
of
freedom 
and 
entirely 
subject 
to 
the 
law 
of 
inevitability.

he 
had

Donets 
horse,
dun-colored, 
with 
light 
mane 
and 
tail, 
and 
when 
he 
rode 
it 
no 
one 
could
outgallop

To 
ride 
this 
horse 
was 
a 
pleasure 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
thought
of 
the 
horse, 
of 
the 
morning, 
of 
the 
doctor's 
wife, 
but 
not 
once 
of 
the
impending 
danger.

Formerly, 
when 
going 
into 
action, 
Rostov 
had 
felt 
afraid; 
now 
he 
had
not 
the 
least 
feeling 
of 
fear. 
He 
was 
fearless, 
not 
because 
he 
had 
grown
used 
to 
being 
under 
fire 
(one 
cannot 
grow 
used 
to 
danger), 
but 
because
he 
had 
learned 
how 
to 
manage 
his 
thoughts 
when 
in 
danger. 
He 
had 
grown
accustomed 
when 
going 
into 
action 
to 
think 
about 
anything 
but 
what 
would
seem 
most 
likely 
to 
interest 
him-the 
impending 
danger. 
During 
the
first 
period 
of 
his 
service, 
hard 
as 
he 
tried 
and 
much 
as 
he 
reproached
himself 
with 
cowardice, 
he 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to 
do 
this, 
but 
with 
time
it 
had 
come 
of<p>
itself. 
Now 
he 
rode 
beside 
Ilyin 
under 
the 
birch 
trees,
occasionally 
plucking 
leaves 
from 
a 
branch 
that 
met 
his 
hand, 
sometimes
touching 
his 
horse's 
side 
with 
his 
foot, 
or, 
without 
turning 
round,
handing 
a 
pipe 
he 
had 
finished 
to 
an 
hussar 
riding 
behind 
him, 
with 
as
calm 
and 
careless 
an 
air 
as 
though 
he 
were 
merely 
out 
for 
a 
ride. 
He
glanced 
with 
pity 
at 
the 
excited 
face 
of 
Ilyin, 
who 
talked 
much 
and 
in
great 
agitation. 
He 
knew 
from 
experience 
the 
tormenting 
expectation 
of
terror 
and 
death 
the 
cornet 
was 
suffering 
and 
knew 
that 
only 
time 
could
help 
him.

As 
soon 
as 
the 
sun 
appeared 
in 
a 
clear 
strip 
of 
sky 
beneath 
the 
clouds,
the 
wind 
fell, 
as 
if 
it 
dared 
not 
spoil 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
summer 
morning
after 
<a href="/cZl/qj9eXK5ZNkA6pXQvm.html">the</a> 
storm; 
drops 
still 
continued 
to 
fall, 
but 
vertically 
now, 
and
all 
was 
still. 
The 
whole 
sun 
appeared 
on 
the 
horizon 
and 
disappeared
behind 
a 
long 
narrow 
cloud 
that 
hung 
above 
it. 
A 
few 
minutes 
later 
it
reappeared 
brighter 
still 
from 
behind 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cloud, 
tearing 
its
edge. 
Everything 
grew 
bright 
and 
glittered. 
And 
with 
that 
light, 
and 
as
if 
in 
reply 
to 
it, 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
guns 
ahead 
of 
them.

Before 
Rostov 
had 
had 
time 
to 
consider<p>
and 
determine 
the 
distance 
of
that 
firing, 
Count 
Ostermann-Tolstoy's 
adjutant 
came 
galloping<p>
from
Vitebsk 
with 
orders 
to 
advance 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
road.

The 
squadron 
overtook 
and 
passed 
the 
infantry 
and 
the 
battery-which 
had
also 
quickened 
their 
pace-rode 
down 
a 
hill, 
and 
passing 
through 
an 
empty
and 
deserted 
village 
again 
ascended. 
The 
horses 
began 
to 
lather 
and 
the
men 
to 
flush.

"Halt! 
Dress<p>
your 
ranks!" 
the 
order<p>
of 
the 
regimental 
commander 
was
heard 
ahead. 
"Forward 
by 
the 
left. 
Walk, 
march!" 
came 
the 
order 
from 
in
front.

And 
the 
hussars, 
passing 
along 
the 
line 
of 
troops 
on 
the 
left 
flank 
of
our 
position, 
halted 
behind 
our<p>
Uhlans 
who 
were

To

He 
had 
that 
common 
sense 
of 
a
matter-of-fact 
man 
which 
showed 
him 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gv8sCi8PFi5qB.html">what</a>

Why

he 
did 
not

but 
after 
his
after-dinner 
nap 
he 
gave 
orders 
to 
saddle 
Mars, 
an 
extremely 
vicious
gray 
stallion 
that 
had 
not 
been 
ridden 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
and 
when
he 
returned 
with 
the

all 
in 
a

he 
informed 
Lavrushka
(Denisov's 
servant 
who 
had 
remained 
with 
him) 
and 
his 
comrades 
who
turned 
up 
in 
the 
evening 
that 
he 
was 
applying 
for

was 
going

Difficult

for 
him 
to 
reflect 
that 
he 
would
go 
away 
without

this

extremely-whether 
he 
was

would 
receive

who 
was

for

Prince

"Oh

frightened,

He 
came

up

embraced 
and 
kissed 
him. 
"Good-by,

off!" 
he 
shouted. 
"Whether 
we 
meet 
again

not..." 
and 
turning 
away
hurriedly 
he 
entered 
the 
shed.

It 
was 
already 
dark, 
and 
Pierre 
could 
not

out 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/LN8bju0.html">whether</a> 
the
expression 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
face 
was 
angry 
or 
tender.

For 
some 
time 
he 
stood 
in 
silence 
considering 
whether 
he 
should 
follow
him 
or 
go 
away. 
"No, 
he 
does 
not 
want 
it!" 
Pierre 
concluded. 
"And 
I 
know
that 
this 
is 
our

He 
sighed 
deeply 
and 
rode 
back 
to 
Gorki.

On 
re-entering 
the 
shed 
Prince 
Andrew 
lay 
down 
on 
a 
rug, 
but 
he 
could
not 
sleep.

He 
closed 
his 
eyes. 
One 
picture 
succeeded 
another 
in 
his 
imagination. 
On
one 
of 
them 
he 
dwelt 
long 
and 
joyfully. 
He 
vividly 
recalled 
an 
evening
in 
Petersburg. 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gj8N5o1jbFN.html">Natasha</a> 
with 
animated 
and 
excited 
face 
was 
telling 
him
how 
she 
had<p>
gone 
to 
look 
for 
mushrooms 
the 
previous 
summer 
and 
had 
lost
her 
way 
in 
the 
big 
forest. 
She 
incoherently 
described 
the 
depths 
of
the 
forest, 
her 
feelings, 
and 
a 
talk 
with 
a 
beekeeper 
she 
met, 
and
constantly 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak7z7iY0e.html">interrupted</a> 
her 
story 
to 
say: 
"No, 
I 
can't! 
I'm 
not 
telling
it 
right; 
no, 
you 
don't 
understand," 
though 
he 
encouraged 
her 
by 
saying
that 
he 
did 
understand, 
and 
he 
really 
had 
understood 
all 
she 
wanted 
to
say. 
But 
Natasha 
was 
not 
satisfied 
with 
her 
own 
words: 
she 
felt 
that
they 
did 
not 
convey 
the 
passionately 
poetic 
feeling 
she 
had 
experienced
that 
day 
and 
wished 
to 
convey. 
"He 
was 
such 
a 
delightful 
old 
man, 
and
it 
was 
so 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Hr21HI7.html">dark</a> 
in 
the

and 
he 
had 
such 
kind... 
No, 
I 
can't
describe 
it," 
she 
had 
said, 
flushed 
and 
excited. 
Prince 
Andrew 
smiled
now 
the 
same 
happy 
smile 
as 
then 
when 
he 
had<p>
looked 
into 
her 
eyes. 
"I
understood 
her," 
he 
thought. 
"I 
not 
only 
understood 
her, 
but 
it 
was 
just
that 
inner, 
spiritual 
force, 
that 
sincerity, 
that 
frankness 
of 
soul-that
very 
soul 
of 
hers 
which 
seemed 
to 
be 
fettered 
by 
her 
body-it 
was 
that
soul 
I 
loved 
in 
her... 
loved 
so 
strongly 
and 
happily..." 
and 
suddenly
he 
remembered 
how 
his 
love 
had 
ended. 
"He 
did 
not 
need 
anything 
of 
that
kind. 
He 
neither 
saw 
nor 
understood 
anything 
of 
the 
sort. 
He 
only 
saw 
in
her 
a 
pretty 
and 
fresh 
young 
girl, 
with 
whom 
he 
did 
not 
deign 
to 
unite
his 
fate. 
And 
I?... 
and 
he 
is 
still 
alive 
and 
gay!"

Prince 
Andrew 
jumped 
up 
as 
if 
someone 
had 
burned 
him, 
and 
again 
began
pacing 
up 
and 
down 
in 
front 
of 
the 
shed.





CHAPTER 
XXVI

On 
August 
25, 
the 
eve 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino, 
M. 
de 
Beausset, 
prefect
of 
the 
French 
Emperor's 
palace, 
arrived 
at 
Napoleon's 
quarters 
at
Valuevo 
with 
Colonel 
Fabvier, 
the 
former 
from 
Paris 
and 
the 
latter 
from
Madrid.

Donning 
his 
court 
uniform, 
M. 
de 
Beausset 
ordered 
a 
box 
he 
had
brought 
for 
the 
Emperor 
to 
be 
carried 
before 
him 
and 
entered 
the 
first
compartment 
of 
Napoleon's 
tent, 
where 
he 
began 
opening 
the 
box 
while
conversing 
with 
Napoleon's 
aides-de-camp 
who 
surrounded 
him.

Fabvier, 
not 
entering 
the 
tent, 
remained 
at 
the 
entrance 
talking 
to 
some
generals 
of 
his 
acquaintance.

The 
Emperor 
Napoleon 
had 
not 
yet 
left 
his 
bedroom 
and 
was 
finishing 
his
toilet. 
Slightly 
snorting 
and 
grunting, 
he 
presented 
now 
his 
back 
and
now 
his 
plump 
hairy 
chest 
to 
the 
brush 
with 
which 
his 
valet 
was 
rubbing
him 
down.

there

it

but 
nothing 
could 
be 
seen 
of 
what 
was
going 
on 
in

Whether

six

in 
that

mist, 
no 
one
knew 
till 
after 
eight 
o'clock.

It 
was 
nine 
o'clock 
in 
the 
morning. 
The 
fog 
lay 
unbroken 
like 
a 
sea
down 
below, 
but 
higher 
up 
at 
the 
village 
of 
Schlappanitz 
where 
Napoleon
stood 
with 
his 
marshals 
around 
him, 
it 
was 
quite 
light. 
Above 
him 
was
a 
clear 
blue 
sky, 
and 
the 
sun's 
vast 
orb 
quivered 
like 
a 
huge 
hollow,
crimson 
float 
on 
the 
surface 
of 
that 
milky 
sea 
of 
mist. 
The 
whole 
French
army, 
and 
even 
Napoleon 
himself 
with 
his 
staff, 
were 
not 
on 
the 
far 
side
of 
the 
streams 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">and</a>

we

were 
on 
this
side, 
so 
close 
to 
our 
own 
forces 
that 
Napoleon 
with 
the 
naked 
eye 
could
distinguish 
a 
mounted 
man 
from 
one 
on 
foot. 
Napoleon, 
in 
the 
blue 
cloak
which 
he 
had<p>
worn 
on 
his 
Italian 
campaign, 
sat 
on 
his 
small 
gray 
Arab
horse 
a 
little<p>
in 
front 
of 
his 
marshals. 
He<p>
gazed 
silently 
at 
the 
hills
which 
seemed 
to 
rise 
out 
of 
the 
sea 
of 
mist 
and 
on 
which 
the 
Russian
troops 
were 
moving 
in 
the 
distance, 
and 
he 
listened 
to 
the 
sounds 
of
firing 
in 
the 
valley. 
Not 
a 
single 
muscle 
of 
his 
face-which 
in 
those
days 
was<p>
still 
thin-moved. 
His 
gleaming 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
intently 
on
one 
spot. 
His 
predictions 
were 
being 
justified. 
Part 
of 
the 
Russian
force 
had 
already 
descended 
into 
the 
valley 
toward 
the 
ponds 
and 
lakes
and 
part 
were 
leaving 
these 
Pratzen<p>
Heights 
which 
he 
intended 
to 
attack
and 
regarded 
as 
the 
key 
to 
the 
position. 
<a href="/cZl/ND8byQW61INH.html">He</a> 
saw 
over 
the 
mist 
that 
in
a 
hollow 
between 
two 
hills 
near 
the 
village 
of 
Pratzen, 
the 
Russian
columns, 
their 
bayonets 
glittering, 
were 
moving 
continuously 
in 
one
direction 
toward 
the 
valley 
and 
disappearing 
one 
after 
another 
into
the 
mist. 
From 
information 
he 
had 
received 
the 
evening 
before, 
from 
the
sound 
of 
wheels 
and 
footsteps 
heard 
by 
the 
outposts 
during 
the 
night,
by 
the 
disorderly 
movement 
of 
the 
Russian 
columns, 
and 
from 
all
indications, 
he 
saw 
clearly 
that 
the 
allies 
believed 
him 
to 
be 
far 
away
in 
front 
of 
them, 
and 
that 
the 
columns 
moving 
near 
Pratzen 
constituted
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/GZb4mEX0cLYU3mSaQt.html">center</a> 
of 
the 
Russian 
army, 
and 
that 
that 
center 
was 
already
sufficiently 
weakened 
to 
be 
successfully 
attacked. 
But 
still 
he 
did 
not
begin 
the 
engagement.

Today 
was 
a 
great 
day 
for 
him-the 
anniversary 
of 
his 
coronation.
Before 
dawn 
he 
had 
slept 
<a href="/cZl/HG89CBzhL.html">for</a> 
a 
few 
hours, 
and 
refreshed, 
vigorous, 
and
in 
good 
spirits, 
he 
mounted 
his 
horse 
and 
rode 
out 
into<p>
the 
field
in 
that 
happy 
mood 
in 
which 
everything 
seems 
possible 
and 
everything
succeeds. 
He 
sat 
motionless, 
looking 
at 
the 
heights 
visible 
above
the 
mist, 
and 
his 
cold 
face 
wore 
that 
special 
look 
of 
confident,
self-complacent 
happiness 
that 
one 
sees 
on 
the 
face 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NXJ5AHAK.html">a</a> 
boy 
happily
in 
love. 
The 
marshals 
stood 
behind 
him 
not 
venturing 
to 
distract 
his
attention. 
He 
looked 
now 
at 
the 
Pratzen 
Heights, 
now 
at 
the 
sun 
floating
up 
out 
of 
the 
mist.

When 
the 
sun 
had 
entirely 
emerged 
from 
the 
fog, 
and 
fields 
and

were
aglow 
with

if 
he 
had 
only 
awaited 
this 
to 
begin 
the
action-he 
drew 
the 
glove 
from 
his 
shapely 
white 
hand, 
made 
a 
sign
with 
it 
to 
the 
marshals, 
and 
ordered 
the 
action 
to 
begin.

Something 
else, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UZ5O5Yg6kplH.html">resembling</a> 
remorse, 
tormented 
him. 
"Yes,

Rostov 
saw 
the 
prisoners 
being 
led 
away 
and 
galloped 
after 
them 
to 
have
a 
look 
at 
his 
Frenchman 
with 
the 
dimple 
on 
his 
chin. 
He 
was 
sitting 
in
his 
foreign 
uniform 
on 
an 
hussar 
packhorse 
and 
looked 
anxiously 
about
him. 
The 
sword 
cut 
on 
his 
arm 
could 
scarcely 
be 
called 
a 
wound. 
He
glanced 
at 
Rostov 
with 
a 
feigned 
smile 
and 
waved 
his 
hand 
in 
greeting.
Rostov 
still 
had 
the 
same 
indefinite 
feeling, 
as 
of 
shame.

All 
that 
day 
and 
the 
next 
his 
friends 
and 
comrades 
noticed 
that 
Rostov,
without 
being 
dull 
or 
angry, 
was 
silent, 
thoughtful, 
and 
preoccupied.
He 
drank 
reluctantly, 
tried 
to 
remain 
alone, 
and 
kept 
turning 
something
over 
in 
his 
mind.

Rostov 
was 
always 
thinking 
about 
that 
brilliant 
exploit 
of 
his, 
which 
to
his 
amazement 
had 
gained 
him 
the 
St. 
George's 
Cross 
and 
even 
given 
him
a 
reputation 
for 
bravery, 
and 
there 
was 
something 
he 
could 
not<p>
at 
all
understand. 
"So 
others 
are 
even 
more 
afraid 
than 
I 
am!" 
he 
thought. 
"So
that's 
all 
there 
is 
in 
what 
is 
called 
heroism! 
And 
did 
I 
do 
it 
for 
my
country's 
sake? 
And 
how 
was 
he 
to 
blame, 
with 
his 
dimple 
and 
blue 
eyes?
And 
how 
frightened 
he 
was! 
He 
thought 
that 
I 
should 
kill 
him. 
Why 
should
I 
kill 
him? 
My 
hand 
trembled. 
And 
they 
have 
given 
me 
a 
St. 
George's
Cross.... 
I 
can't 
make 
it 
out 
at 
all."

But 
while 
Nicholas 
was 
considering 
these 
questions 
and 
still 
could 
reach
no 
clear 
solution 
of 
what 
puzzled 
him 
so, 
the 
wheel 
of 
fortune 
in 
the
service, 
as 
often 
happens, 
turned 
in 
his 
favor. 
After 
the 
affair 
at
Ostrovna 
he 
was 
brought 
into 
notice, 
received 
command 
of 
an 
hussar
battalion, 
and 
when 
a 
brave 
officer 
was 
needed 
he 
was 
chosen.

Nicholas

provincial
society 
by 
his 
agility. 
His 
particularly 
free 
manner 
of 
dancing 
even
surprised 
them 
all. 
Nicholas 
was 
himself 
rather 
surprised 
at 
the 
way 
he
danced 
that 
evening. 
He 
had 
never 
danced 
like 
that 
in 
Moscow 
and 
would
even 
have 
considered 
such 
a 
very 
free 
and 
easy 
manner 
improper 
and 
in
bad 
form, 
but 
here 
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/GoY5tHLaX8y2oFuln.html">felt</a> 
it 
incumbent 
on 
him 
to 
astonish 
them 
all 
by
something 
unusual, 
something 
they 
would 
have 
to 
accept 
as 
the 
regular
thing 
in 
the<p>
capital 
though 
new 
to 
them 
in 
the 
provinces.

All 
the 
evening 
Nicholas 
paid 
attention 
to 
a 
blue-eyed, 
plump<p>
and
pleasing 
little 
blonde, 
the 
wife 
of 
one 
of 
the 
provincial 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jbn1GBzwy5Bxal6mAz.html">officials.
With</a> 
the 
naive 
conviction 
of 
young 
men 
in 
a 
merry 
mood 
that 
other 
men's
wives 
were 
created 
for 
them, 
Rostov 
did 
not 
leave 
the 
lady's 
side 
and
treated 
her 
husband 
in 
a 
friendly 
and 
conspiratorial 
style, 
as 
if,
without 
speaking 
of 
it, 
they 
knew 
how 
capitally 
Nicholas 
and 
the 
lady
would 
get 
on 
together. 
The 
husband, 
however, 
did 
not 
seem 
to 
share 
that
conviction 
and 
tried 
to 
behave 
morosely 
with 
Rostov. 
But 
the
latter's 
good-natured 
naivete 
was 
so 
boundless 
that 
sometimes 
even 
he
involuntarily 
yielded 
to 
Nicholas' 
good 
humor. 
Toward 
the 
end 
of 
the
evening, 
however, 
as 
the 
wife's 
face 
grew 
more 
flushed 
and 
animated, 
the
husband's 
became 
more 
and 
more 
melancholy 
and 
solemn, 
as 
though 
there
were 
but 
a 
given 
amount 
of 
animation 
between 
them 
and 
as 
the 
wife's
share 
increased 
the 
husband's 
diminished.





CHAPTER 
V

Nicholas 
sat 
leaning 
slightly 
forward 
in 
an 
armchair, 
bending 
closely
over 
the 
blonde 
lady 
and 
paying 
her 
mythological 
compliments 
with 
a
smile 
that 
never 
left 
his 
face. 
Jauntily 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tiR9CWm3gi4.html">shifting</a> 
the 
position 
of 
his
legs 
in 
their 
tight 
riding 
breeches, 
diffusing 
an 
odor

perfume, 
and
admiring 
his 
partner, 
himself, 
and 
the 
fine 
outlines 
of 
his 
legs

certain

here 
in

"A

one. 
Her

Together 
with 
that 
sound
came 
a 
solitary 
human 
cry 
from 
the 
gateway 
and 
amid 
the 
smoke 
appeared
the 
figure 
of<p>
a 
bareheaded 
man 
in<p>
a 
peasant's 
coat. 
He 
grasped 
a 
musket
and 
took 
aim 
at 
the 
French. 
"Fire!" 
repeated 
the 
officer 
once 
more,
and 
the 
reports 
of 
a 
musket 
and 
of 
two 
cannon 
shots 
were 
heard
simultaneously. 
The 
gate 
was 
again 
hidden 
by 
smoke.

Nothing 
more 
stirred 
behind 
the 
screens 
and 
the 
French 
infantry 
soldiers
and 
officers 
advanced 
to 
the 
gate. 
In 
the 
gateway 
lay 
three 
wounded 
and
four 
dead. 
Two 
men 
in 
peasant 
coats 
ran 
away 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
wall,
toward<p>
the 
Znamenka.

"Clear 
that 
away!" 
said 
the 
officer, 
pointing 
to 
the 
beams 
and 
the
corpses, 
and 
the 
French 
soldiers, 
after 
dispatching 
the 
wounded, 
threw
the 
corpses 
over 
the 
parapet.

Who 
these 
men 
were 
nobody 
knew. 
"Clear 
that 
away!" 
was 
all 
that 
was 
said
of 
them, 
and 
they 
were 
thrown 
over 
the 
parapet 
and 
removed 
later 
on 
that
they 
might 
not<p>
stink. 
Thiers 
alone 
dedicates 
a 
few 
eloquent 
lines 
to
their 
memory: 
"These 
wretches 
had 
occupied 
the 
sacred 
citadel, 
having
supplied 
themselves 
with 
<a href="/aVzUge/tKu9oqP1EMvs0G.html">guns</a> 
from 
the 
arsenal, 
and 
fired" 
(the
wretches) 
"at 
the 
French. 
Some 
of 
them 
were 
sabered 
and 
the 
Kremlin 
was
purged 
of 
their 
presence."

Murat 
was 
informed 
that 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ex5AyyZE1suDcq7kQqNG.html">way</a> 
had 
been 
cleared. 
The 
French 
entered
the 
gates 
and 
began 
pitching 
their 
camp 
in 
the 
Senate 
Square. 
Out 
of 
the
windows 
of 
the 
Senate 
House 
the 
soldiers 
threw 
chairs 
into 
the 
Square
for 
fuel 
and 
kindled 
fires 
there.

Other 
detachments 
passed 
through 
the<p>
Kremlin 
and 
encamped 
along
the 
Moroseyka, 
the 
Lubyanka, 
and 
Pokrovka 
Streets. 
Others 
quartered
themselves 
along 
the 
Vozdvizhenka, 
the 
Nikolski, 
and 
the 
Tverskoy
Streets. 
No 
masters 
of 
the 
houses 
being 
found 
anywhere, 
the 
French 
were
not 
billeted 
on 
the 
inhabitants 
as 
is 
usual 
in 
towns 
but 
lived 
in 
it 
as
in 
a 
camp.

Though 
tattered, 
hungry, 
worn 
out, 
and 
reduced 
to 
a 
third 
of 
their
original 
number, 
the 
French 
entered 
Moscow 
in 
good 
marching 
order. 
It
was 
a 
weary 
and 
famished, 
but 
still 
a 
fighting 
and 
menacing 
army. 
But
it 
remained 
an 
army 
only<p>
until 
its 
soldiers 
had 
dispersed 
into 
their
different 
lodgings. 
As 
soon 
as 
the 
men 
of 
the 
various 
regiments 
began
to 
disperse 
among 
the 
wealthy 
and 
deserted 
houses, 
the 
army 
was 
lost
forever 
and 
there 
came 
into 
being 
something 
nondescript, 
neither
citizens 
nor 
soldiers 
but 
what 
are 
known 
as 
marauders. 
When 
five 
weeks
later 
these 
same 
men 
left 
Moscow, 
they 
no 
longer 
formed 
an 
army. 
They
were 
a 
mob<p>
of 
marauders, 
each 
carrying 
a 
quantity 
of 
articles 
which
seemed 
to 
him 
valuable 
or 
useful. 
The 
aim 
of 
each 
man 
when 
he 
left
Moscow 
was 
no 
longer, 
as 
it 
had 
been, 
to 
conquer, 
but 
merely 
to<p>
keep
what 
he 
had 
acquired. 
Like 
a 
monkey 
which 
puts 
its 
paw 
into 
the 
narrow
neck 
of 
a 
jug, 
and 
having 
seized 
a 
handful 
of 
nuts 
will 
not 
open 
its
fist 
for 
fear 
of 
losing 
what 
it 
holds, 
and 
therefore 
perishes, 
the
French 
when 
they 
left 
Moscow 
had 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">inevitably</a> 
to 
perish 
because 
they
carried 
their 
loot 
with 
them, 
yet 
to 
abandon 
what 
they 
had 
stolen 
was 
as
impossible

them

it 
is 
for 
the 
monkey 
to 
open 
its

after

had

This 
is 
what 
makes 
it
evident 
that 
a 
drowning 
man 
is 
less 
free 
and 
more 
subject 
to 
necessity
than 
one 
standing<p>
on 
dry 
ground, 
and 
that 
makes 
the 
actions 
of 
a 
man
closely 
connected 
with 
others 
in 
a 
thickly 
populated 
district, 
or 
of 
one
bound 
by 
family, 
official, 
or 
business 
duties, 
seem 
certainly 
less 
free
and 
more 
subject 
to 
necessity 
than 
those 
of 
a 
man 
living 
in 
solitude 
and
seclusion.

If 
we 
consider 
a 
man 
alone, 
apart 
from 
his 
relation 
to 
everything 
around
him, 
each 
action 
of 
his 
seems 
to 
us 
free. 
But 
if 
we 
see 
his 
relation
to 
anything 
around 
him, 
if 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/LN8bju0.html">we</a> 
see 
his 
connection 
with 
anything
whatever-with 
a 
man 
who 
speaks 
to 
him, 
a 
book 
he 
reads, 
the 
work 
on
which 
he 
is 
engaged, 
even 
with 
the 
air 
he 
breathes 
or 
the 
light 
that
falls 
on 
the 
things 
about 
him-we 
see 
that 
each 
of 
these 
circumstances
has 
an 
influence 
on 
him 
and 
controls 
at 
least 
some 
side 
of 
his 
activity.
And 
the 
more 
we 
perceive 
of 
these 
influences 
the 
more 
our 
conception 
of
his 
freedom 
diminishes 
and 
the 
more 
our 
conception 
of 
the 
necessity 
that
weighs 
on 
him 
increases.

The 
second 
consideration 
is 
the 
more 
or 
less 
evident 
time 
relation 
of
the 
man 
to 
the 
world 
and 
the 
clearness 
of 
our 
perception 
of 
the 
place
the 
man's 
action 
occupies 
in 
time. 
That 
is 
the 
ground 
which 
makes 
the
fall 
of 
the 
first 
man, 
resulting 
in 
the 
production 
of 
the 
human 
race,
appear 
evidently 
less 
free 
than 
a 
man's 
entry 
into 
marriage 
today. 
It 
is
the 
reason 
why 
the 
life 
and 
activity 
of 
people 
who 
lived 
centuries 
ago
and 
are 
connected 
with 
me 
in 
time 
cannot 
seem 
to 
me 
as 
free 
as 
the 
life
of 
a 
contemporary, 
the 
consequences 
of 
which 
are 
still 
unknown 
to 
me.

The 
degree 
of 
our 
conception 
of 
freedom 
or 
inevitability 
depends 
in 
this
respect 
on 
the 
greater 
or 
lesser 
lapse 
of 
time 
between 
the 
performance
of 
the 
action 
and 
our 
judgment 
of 
it.

If 
I 
examine 
an 
act 
I 
performed 
a 
moment 
ago 
in 
approximately 
the 
same
circumstances 
as 
those 
I 
am 
in 
now, 
my 
action 
appears 
to 
me 
undoubtedly
free. 
But 
if 
I 
examine 
an 
act 
performed 
a 
month 
ago, 
then 
being 
in
different 
circumstances, 
I 
cannot 
help 
recognizing 
that 
if 
that 
act 
had
not 
been 
committed 
much 
that 
resulted 
from 
it-good, 
agreeable, 
and 
even
essential-would 
not 
have 
taken 
place. 
If 
I 
reflect 
on 
an 
action 
still
more 
remote, 
ten 
years 
ago 
or 
more, 
then 
the 
consequences 
of 
my 
action
are 
still 
plainer 
to 
me 
and 
I 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
would 
have
happened 
had 
that 
action 
not 
been 
performed. 
The 
farther 
I 
go 
back
in 
memory, 
or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
the 
farther 
I 
go 
forward 
in 
my
judgment, 
the 
more 
doubtful 
becomes 
my 
belief 
in 
the 
freedom 
of 
my
action.

In 
history 
we 
find 
a 
very 
similar 
progress 
of 
conviction 
concerning
the 
part 
played 
by 
free 
will 
in 
the 
general 
affairs 
of 
humanity. 
A
contemporary 
event 
seems 
to 
us 
to 
be 
indubitably 
the 
doing 
of 
all 
the
known 
participants, 
but 
with 
a 
more 
remote 
event 
we 
already 
see 
its
inevitable 
results 
which 
prevent 
our 
considering 
anything 
else 
possible.
And 
the 
farther 
we 
go 
back 
in 
examining 
events 
the 
less 
arbitrary 
do
they 
appear.

The 
Austro-Prussian 
war 
appears 
to 
us 
undoubtedly 
the 
result 
of 
the
crafty 
conduct 
of 
Bismarck, 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
Napoleonic 
wars 
still 
seem
to 
us, 
though 
already 
questionably, 
to 
be 
the 
outcome 
of 
their 
heroes'
will. 
But 
in 
the 
Crusades 
we 
already 
see 
an 
event 
occupying 
its 
definite
place 
in 
history 
and 
without 
which 
we 
cannot 
imagine 
the 
modern 
history
of 
Europe, 
though 
to 
the 
chroniclers 
of 
the 
Crusades 
that

The

by 
Count 
Rostopchin's

had 
already 
in 
June 
moved 
with 
her
Negroes

from 
Moscow 
to 
her 
Saratov 
estate, 
with
a 
vague 
consciousness 
that 
she 
was 
not 
Bonaparte's

was 
really,

saved

When 
he 
had 
finished 
the 
Litany 
the 
deacon 
crossed 
the 
stole 
over 
his
breast 
and 
said, 
"Let

"Lord

impatient 
emotion 
in 
her

not 
crossing

letting 
her 
slender

hang 
down 
as 
if 
expecting 
some
invisible 
power 
at 
any 
moment 
to 
take 
her 
and 
deliver 
her 
from 
herself,
from 
her 
regrets, 
desires, 
remorse, 
hopes, 
and 
sins.

The 
countess 
looked 
round 
several 
times 
at 
her 
daughter's 
softened 
face
and 
shining 
eyes 
and 
prayed 
God 
to 
help 
her.

Unexpectedly, 
in 
the 
middle<p>
of 
the 
service, 
and 
not 
in 
the 
usual 
order
Natasha 
knew 
so 
well, 
the 
deacon 
brought 
out 
a 
small 
stool, 
the 
one 
he
knelt 
on 
when 
praying 
on 
Trinity 
Sunday, 
and 
placed 
it 
before 
the 
doors
of 
the 
sanctuary 
screen. 
The 
priest 
came 
out 
with 
his 
purple 
velvet
biretta 
on 
his 
head, 
adjusted 
his 
hair, 
and 
knelt 
down 
with 
an 
effort.
Everybody 
followed 
his 
example 
and 
they 
looked 
at 
one 
another 
in
surprise. 
Then 
came 
the 
prayer 
just 
received 
from 
the 
Synod-a 
prayer 
for
the 
deliverance 
of 
Russia 
from 
hostile 
invasion.

"Lord 
God 
of 
might, 
God 
of 
our 
salvation!" 
began 
the 
priest 
in 
that
voice, 
clear, 
not 
grandiloquent 
but 
mild, 
in 
which 
only 
the 
Slav 
clergy
read 
and 
which 
acts 
so 
irresistibly 
on 
a 
Russian 
heart.

"Lord 
God

If

a

little 
dependent 
on 
external

whose 
action 
was 
performed 
very 
recently, 
and 
the

of
whose

are 
beyond

ken, 
we 
get 
the 
conception 
of 
a 
minimum 
of
inevitability 
and 
a 
maximum 
of 
freedom.

In

causes
of

we 
ever 
conceive 
either 
complete 
freedom 
or
complete 
necessity.

(1) 
To 
whatever 
degree 
we 
may 
imagine 
a 
man 
to 
be 
exempt 
from 
the
influence 
of 
the 
external 
world, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom
in 
space. 
Every 
human 
action 
is 
inevitably 
conditioned 
by 
what 
surrounds
him 
and 
by 
his 
own 
body. 
I 
lift 
my 
arm 
and 
let 
it 
fall. 
My 
action 
seems
to 
me 
free; 
but 
asking 
myself 
whether 
I 
could 
raise 
my 
arm 
in 
every
direction, 
I 
see 
that 
I 
raised 
it 
in 
the 
direction 
in 
which 
there 
was
least 
obstruction 
to 
that 
action 
either 
from 
things 
around 
me 
or 
from
the 
construction 
of 
my 
own 
body. 
I 
chose<p>
one 
out 
of 
all 
the 
possible
directions 
because 
in 
it 
there<p>
were 
fewest 
obstacles. 
For 
my 
action
to 
be 
free 
it 
was 
necessary 
that 
it 
should 
encounter 
no 
obstacles. 
To
conceive 
of 
a 
man 
being 
free 
we 
must 
imagine 
him 
outside 
space, 
which 
is
evidently 
impossible.

(2) 
However 
much 
we 
approximate 
the 
time 
of 
judgment 
to 
the 
time 
of 
the
deed, 
we 
never 
get 
a 
conception 
of 
freedom 
in 
time. 
For 
if 
I

committed 
a 
second 
<a href="/aVzUge/hW2bXmQ81KA.html">ago</a> 
I 
must 
still 
recognize 
it 
as 
not
being 
free, 
for 
it 
is 
irrevocably 
linked 
to 
the 
moment 
at 
which 
it 
was
committed. 
Can 
I

I

To

now!... 
So 
you, 
too, 
are 
in 
the 
great 
world?" 
said 
he 
to
Pierre.

"I 
knew 
you 
would 
be 
here," 
replied 
Pierre. 
"I 
will 
come 
to 
supper
with 
you. 
May 
I?" 
he 
added 
in 
a 
low 
voice 
so 
as 
not 
to 
disturb 
the
vicomte 
who 
was 
continuing 
his 
story.

"No, 
impossible!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
laughing 
and 
pressing
Pierre's 
hand 
to 
show 
that 
there 
was 
no 
need 
to 
ask 
the 
question. 
He
wished 
to 
say 
something 
more, 
but 
at 
that 
moment 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
his
daughter 
got 
up 
to 
go 
and 
the 
two 
young 
men 
rose 
to 
let 
them 
pass.

"You 
must 
excuse 
me, 
dear 
Vicomte," 
said 
Prince 
Vasili 
to 
the
Frenchman, 
holding 
him 
down 
by 
the 
sleeve 
in 
a 
friendly 
way 
to 
prevent
his 
rising. 
"This 
unfortunate 
fete 
at 
the 
ambassador's 
deprives 
me
of 
a 
pleasure, 
and 
obliges 
me 
to 
interrupt 
you. 
I 
am 
very 
sorry 
to 
leave
your 
enchanting 
party," 
said 
he, 
turning 
to 
Anna 
Pavlovna.

His 
daughter, 
Princess 
Helene, 
passed 
between 
the 
chairs, 
lightly
holding 
up 
the 
folds 
of 
her 
dress, 
and 
the 
smile 
shone 
still 
more
radiantly 
on 
her 
beautiful 
face.<p>
Pierre 
gazed 
at 
her 
with 
rapturous,
almost 
frightened, 
eyes 
as<p>
she 
passed 
him.

"Very 
lovely," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

"Very," 
said

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">galloped</a> 
forward 
along 
the 
village 
street.

He 
could 
hear 
shooting 
ahead 
of 
him. 
Cossacks, 
hussars, 
and 
ragged
Russian 
prisoners, 
who 
had 
come 
running 
from 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
road,
were 
shouting 
something 
loudly 
and 
incoherently. 
A 
gallant-looking
Frenchman, 
in 
a 
blue 
overcoat, 
capless, 
and 
with 
a 
frowning 
red 
face,
had 
been 
defending 
himself 
against<p>
the 
hussars. 
When 
Petya 
galloped
up 
the 
Frenchman 
had 
already 
fallen. 
"Too 
late 
again!" 
flashed 
through
Petya's 
mind 
and 
he 
galloped 
on 
to 
the 
place 
from 
which 
the 
rapid 
firing
could 
be 
heard. 
The 
shots 
came 
from 
the 
yard 
of 
the 
landowner's 
house
he 
had 
visited 
the<p>
night 
before 
with 
Dolokhov. 
The 
French 
were 
making
a 
stand 
there 
behind 
a 
wattle 
fence 
in 
a 
garden 
thickly 
overgrown 
with
bushes 
and 
were 
firing<p>
at 
the 
Cossacks 
who 
crowded 
at 
the 
gateway.
Through 
the 
smoke, 
as 
he 
approached 
the 
gate, 
Petya 
saw 
Dolokhov, 
whose
face 
was 
of 
a 
pale-greenish 
tint, 
shouting 
to 
his<p>
men. 
"Go 
round! 
Wait
for 
the 
infantry!" 
he 
exclaimed 
as 
Petya 
rode 
up 
to 
him.

"Wait?... 
Hurrah-ah-ah!" 
shouted 
Petya, 
and 
without 
pausing 
a 
moment
galloped 
to 
the 
place 
whence 
came 
the 
sounds 
of 
firing 
and 
where 
the
smoke 
was 
thickest.

A 
volley 
was 
heard, 
and 
some 
bullets 
whistled 
past, 
while 
others 
plashed
against 
something. 
The 
Cossacks 
and 
Dolokhov 
galloped 
after 
Petya 
into
the 
gateway 
of 
the 
courtyard. 
In 
the 
dense 
wavering 
smoke 
some 
of 
the
French 
threw 
down 
their 
arms 
and 
ran 
out 
of 
the 
bushes 
to 
meet 
the
Cossacks, 
while 
others 
ran 
down 
the 
hill 
toward 
the 
pond. 
Petya 
was
galloping 
along 
the 
courtyard, 
but 
instead 
of

the 
reins 
he 
waved
both

strangely,

farther

a 
dim 
perception 
of</h1>the
following 
budget:

About 
80,000 
went 
in 
payments 
on 
all 
the 
estates 
to 
the 
Land 
Bank, 
about
30,000 
went 
for 
the 
upkeep 
of 
the 
estate 
near 
Moscow, 
the 
town 
house,
and 
the 
allowance 
to 
the 
three 
princesses; 
about 
15,000 
was 
given 
in
pensions 
and 
the 
same 
amount 
for 
asylums; 
150,000 
alimony 
was 
sent 
to
the<p>
countess; 
about 
70,000 
went 
for 
interest 
on 
debts. 
The 
building 
of 
a
new 
church, 
previously 
begun, 
had 
cost 
about 
10,000 
in 
each 
of 
the 
last
two 
years, 
and 
he 
did 
not 
know 
how 
the 
rest, 
about 
100,000 
rubles, 
was
spent, 
and 
almost 
every 
year 
he 
was 
obliged 
to 
borrow. 
Besides 
this 
the
chief 
steward 
wrote 
every 
year 
telling 
him 
of 
fires 
and 
bad 
harvests,
or 
of 
the 
necessity 
<a href="/aVzUge/WC6zmeD7cYy0.html">of</a> 
rebuilding 
factories 
and 
workshops. 
So 
the 
first
task 
Pierre 
had 
to 
face 
was 
one 
for 
which 
he 
had 
very 
little 
aptitude 
or
inclination-practical 
business.

He 
discussed 
estate 
affairs 
every 
day 
with 
his 
chief 
steward. 
But
he 
felt 
that 
this 
did 
not 
forward 
matters 
at 
all. 
He 
felt 
that 
these
consultations 
were 
detached<p>
from 
real 
affairs 
and 
did 
not 
link 
up 
with
them 
or 
make 
them 
move. 
On 
the 
one 
hand, 
the 
chief 
steward 
put 
the 
state
of 
things 
to 
him 
in 
the 
very 
worst 
light, 
pointing 
out 
the 
necessity 
of
paying 
off 
the 
debts 
and 
undertaking 
new 
activities 
with 
serf 
labor,
to 
which 
Pierre 
did 
not 
agree. 
On 
the 
other 
hand, 
Pierre 
demanded 
that
steps 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
liberate 
the 
serfs, 
which 
the 
steward 
met 
by
showing 
the 
necessity 
of 
first 
paying 
off 
the 
loans 
from 
the 
Land 
Bank,
and 
the 
consequent 
impossibility 
of 
a 
speedy 
emancipation.

The 
steward 
did 
not 
say 
it 
was<p>
quite 
impossible, 
<a href="/cZl/kQ69HPeSU6XZWkd.html">but</a> 
suggested 
selling
the 
forests 
in 
the 
province 
of 
Kostroma, 
the 
land 
lower 
down 
the 
river,
and 
the 
Crimean 
estate, 
in 
order 
to 
make 
it 
possible: 
all 
of 
which
operations 
according 
to 
him 
were 
connected 
with 
<a href="/cZl/JV5GaVr3hxx6Cv.html">such</a> 
<a href="/cZl/WM2bOIDr5ZUI3HI.html">complicated
measures-the</a> 
removal 
of 
injunctions, 
petitions, 
permits, 
and 
so
on-that 
Pierre 
became 
quite 
bewildered 
and 
only 
replied:

"Yes, 
yes, 
do 
so."

Pierre 
had 
none 
of 
the 
practical 
persistence 
that 
would 
have 
enabled 
him
to 
attend 
to 
the 
business 
himself 
and 
so 
he 
disliked 
it 
and 
only 
tried
to 
pretend 
to 
the 
steward 
that 
he 
was 
attending 
to 
it. 
The 
steward
for 
his 
part 
tried 
to 
pretend 
to 
the 
count 
that 
he 
considered 
these
consultations 
very 
valuable 
for 
the 
proprietor 
and 
troublesome 
to
himself.

In 
Kiev 
Pierre 
found 
some 
people 
he 
knew, 
and 
strangers 
hastened 
to 
make
his 
acquaintance 
and 
joyfully 
welcomed 
the 
rich 
newcomer, 
the
largest 
landowner 
of 
the 
province. 
Temptations 
to 
Pierre's 
greatest
weakness-the 
one 
to 
which 
he 
had 
confessed 
when 
admitted 
to 
the
Lodge-were 
so 
strong 
that 
he 
could 
not 
resist 
them. 
Again 
whole 
days,
weeks, 
and 
months 
of 
his 
life 
passed 
in 
as 
great 
a 
rush 
and 
were 
as 
much
occupied 
with 
evening 
parties, 
dinners, 
lunches, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/nHL70tvJE6nrOP.html">balls,</a> 
giving 
him
no 
time 
for 
reflection, 
as 
in 
Petersburg. 
Instead 
of 
the 
new 
life 
he 
had
hoped 
to 
lead 
he 
still 
lived 
the 
old 
life, 
only 
in 
new 
surroundings.

Of 
the 
three 
precepts 
of 
Freemasonry 
Pierre 
realized 
that 
he 
did 
not
fulfill 
the 
one 
which 
enjoined 
every 
Mason 
to

went 
together 
to

opened 
it
cautiously 
and 
glanced 
into 
the 
room, 
Sonya 
standing 
beside 
her 
at 
the
half-open 
door.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
lying 
raised 
high 
on 
three 
pillows. 
His 
pale 
face 
was
calm, 
his 
eyes 
closed, 
and 
they 
could 
see 
his 
regular 
breathing.

"O, 
Natasha!" 
Sonya 
suddenly 
almost 
screamed, 
catching 
her 
companion's
arm 
and 
stepping 
back 
from 
the 
door.

"What?

asked 
Natasha.

"It's 
that, 
that..." 
said 
Sonya, 
with 
a 
white 
face 
and 
trembling 
lips.

Natasha 
softly 
closed 
the

and 
went 
with 
Sonya 
to 
the 
window, 
not

understanding 
what 
the 
latter 
was 
telling 
her.

"You

said 
Sonya 
with 
a 
solemn 
and 
frightened 
expression.
"You

about 
Prince 
Andrew 
whom 
she<p>
had 
seen
lying 
down.

"You

Sonya 
went 
on. 
"I 
saw 
it 
then 
and 
told 
everybody, 
you
and 
Dunyasha. 
I 
saw 
him 
lying 
on 
a 
bed," 
said 
she, 
making 
a 
gesture 
with
her 
hand 
and 
a 
lifted 
finger 
at 
each 
detail, 
"and 
that 
he 
had 
his 
eyes
closed 
and 
was 
covered 
just 
with 
a 
pink 
quilt,<p>
and 
that 
his 
hands 
were
folded," 
she 
concluded, 
convincing 
herself 
that 
the 
details 
she 
had 
just
seen 
were 
exactly 
what 
she 
had 
seen 
in 
the 
mirror.

She 
had 
in 
fact 
seen 
nothing 
then 
but 
had 
mentioned 
the 
first 
thing 
that
came 
into 
her 
head, 
but 
what 
she 
had 
invented 
then 
seemed 
to 
her 
now
as 
real 
as 
any 
other<p>
recollection. 
She 
not 
only 
remembered 
what 
she 
had
then 
said-that 
he 
turned 
to 
look 
at 
her 
and 
smiled 
and 
was 
covered 
with
something 
red-but 
was 
firmly 
convinced 
that 
she 
had 
then 
seen 
and 
said
that 
he 
was 
covered 
with 
a 
pink 
quilt 
and 
that 
his 
eyes 
were 
closed.

"Yes, 
yes, 
it 
really 
was 
pink!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
who 
now 
thought 
she
too 
remembered 
the 
word 
pink 
being 
used, 
and 
saw 
in 
this 
the 
most
extraordinary 
and 
mysterious 
part 
<a href="/cZl/Nz6YyaBP3SEu2IoNM.html">of</a> 
the 
prediction.

"But 
what 
does 
it 
mean?" 
she 
added 
meditatively.

"Oh, 
I 
don't 
know, 
it 
is 
all 
so 
strange," 
replied 
Sonya, 
clutching 
at
her 
head.

A 
few 
minutes 
later 
Prince 
Andrew 
rang 
and 
Natasha 
went 
to 
him, 
but
Sonya, 
feeling 
unusually 
excited 
and 
touched, 
remained 
at 
the 
window
thinking 
about 
the 
strangeness 
of 
what 
had 
occurred.


They 
had 
an 
opportunity 
that 
day 
to 
send 
letters 
to 
the 
army, 
and 
the
countess 
was 
writing 
to 
her 
son.

"Sonya!" 
said 
the 
countess, 
raising 
her 
eyes 
from 
her 
letter 
as 
her
niece 
passed, 
"Sonya, 
won't 
you 
write 
to 
Nicholas?" 
She 
spoke 
in 
a 
soft,
tremulous 
voice, 
and 
in 
the 
weary 
eyes 
that 
looked 
over 
her 
spectacles
Sonya 
read 
all 
that 
the 
countess 
meant 
to 
convey 
with 
these 
words. 
Those
eyes 
expressed 
entreaty, 
shame 
at

Not

did<p>
his 
reason 
not 
reproach 
him 
for 
what 
he 
had 
done, 
but
he 
even 
found 
cause 
for 
self-satisfaction

himself 
of 
a 
convenient 
opportunity

punish 
a
criminal 
and 
at 
the

pacify 
the 
mob.

"Vereshchagin<p>
was<p>
tried 
and 
condemned 
to 
death," 
thought 
Rostopchin
(though 
the 
Senate 
had 
only 
condemned 
Vereshchagin 
to 
hard 
labor), 
"he
was 
a 
traitor

a

I

I

I

punished

miscreant."

Having 
reached 
his 
country 
house 
and 
begun 
to 
give 
orders 
about 
domestic
arrangements, 
the 
count 
grew 
quite 
tranquil.

Half 
an 
hour 
later 
he 
was 
driving 
with 
his 
fast 
horses 
across 
the
Sokolniki 
field, 
no 
longer 
thinking 
of 
what 
had 
occurred 
but 
considering
what 
<a href="/aVzUge/fk4C7tA.html">was</a> 
to 
come. 
He 
was 
driving 
to 
the 
Yauza 
bridge 
where 
he 
had 
heard
that 
Kutuzov 
was. 
Count 
Rostopchin 
was 
mentally 
preparing 
the 
angry 
and
stinging 
reproaches 
he 
meant 
to 
address 
to<p>
Kutuzov 
for 
his 
deception. 
He
would 
make 
that 
foxy 
old 
courtier 
feel 
that 
the 
responsibility<p>
for 
all
the 
calamities 
that 
would 
follow 
the 
abandonment 
of 
the 
city 
and 
the
ruin 
of 
Russia 
(as 
Rostopchin 
regarded 
it) 
would 
fall 
upon 
his 
doting
old 
head. 
Planning 
beforehand 
what 
he 
would 
say 
to 
Kutuzov, 
Rostopchin
turned 
angrily 
in 
his 
caleche 
and 
gazed 
sternly 
from 
side 
to 
side.

The 
Sokolniki 
field 
was 
deserted. 
Only 
at 
the 
end 
of 
it, 
in 
front 
of 
the
almshouse 
and 
the 
lunatic 
asylum, 
could 
be 
seen 
some 
people 
in 
white
and 
others 
like 
them 
walking 
singly 
across 
the 
field 
shouting 
and
gesticulating.

One 
of 
these 
was 
running 
to 
cross 
the 
path 
of 
Count 
Rostopchin's
carriage, 
and 
the 
count 
himself, 
his 
coachman, 
and 
his 
dragoons
looked 
with 
vague 
horror 
and 
curiosity 
at 
these 
released 
lunatics 
and
especially 
at 
the 
<a href="/cZl/mf16LgATt.html">one</a> 
running 
toward 
them.

Swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side 
on 
his 
long, 
thin 
legs 
in 
his 
fluttering
dressing 
gown, 
this 
lunatic 
was 
running 
impetuously, 
his 
gaze 
fixed 
on
Rostopchin, 
shouting 
something 
in 
a 
hoarse 
voice 
and 
making 
signs 
to 
him
to 
stop. 
The 
lunatic's 
<a href="/aVzUge/EY78hoZsa0.html">solemn,</a> 
gloomy 
face 
was 
thin 
and 
yellow, 
with
its 
beard<p>
growing<p>
in 
uneven 
tufts. 
His 
black, 
agate 
pupils 
with
saffron-yellow 
whites 
moved 
restlessly 
near 
the 
lower 
eyelids.

"Stop! 
Pull 
up, 
I 
tell 
you!" 
he 
cried 
in 
a<p>
piercing 
voice, 
and 
again
shouted 
something 
breathlessly 
with 
emphatic 
intonations 
and 
gestures.

Coming 
abreast 
of 
the 
caleche 
he 
ran 
beside 
it.

"Thrice 
have 
they 
slain 
me, 
thrice 
have 
I 
risen 
from 
the 
dead. 
They
stoned 
me, 
crucified 
me... 
I 
shall 
rise... 
shall 
rise... 
shall 
rise.
They 
have 
torn 
my 
body. 
The 
kingdom 
of 
God 
will 
be 
overthrown... 
Thrice
will 
I 
overthrow 
it 
and 
thrice 
re-establish 
it!" 
he 
cried, 
raising 
his
voice 
higher 
and 
higher.

Count 
Rostopchin 
suddenly 
grew 
pale 
as 
he 
had 
done 
when 
the 
crowd 
closed
in 
on 
Vereshchagin. 
He 
turned 
away. 
"Go 
fas... 
faster!" 
he 
cried 
in 
a
trembling 
voice 
to 
his 
coachman. 
The 
caleche 
flew 
over 
the 
ground 
as
fast 
as 
the 
horses 
could 
draw 
it, 
but 
for 
a 
long 
time 
Count 
Rostopchin
still 
heard 
the 
insane 
despairing 
screams 
growing 
fainter 
in 
the
distance, 
while 
his 
eyes 
saw 
nothing 
but 
the 
astonished, 
frightened,
bloodstained 
face 
of 
"the 
traitor" 
in 
the 
fur-lined 
coat.

Recent<p>
as 
that 
mental 
picture 
was, 
Rostopchin 
already 
felt 
that 
it 
had
cut 
deep 
into 
his 
heart 
and 
drawn 
blood. 
Even 
now 
he 
felt 
clearly 
that
the 
gory 
trace 
of 
that 
recollection 
would 
not 
pass 
with 
time, 
but 
that
the 
terrible

would,

contrary,

By

Pierre 
was 
at 
once 
carried 
back 
to 
the 
day
when, 
trying 
to

he

the

and 
the

took 
possession

him

Tears 
suddenly 
rose 
in

she 
turned 
away, 
lifted 
her 
music
before 
her 
eyes, 
began 
singing 
again, 
and 
again 
began 
walking 
up 
and
down 
the 
room.

Just 
then 
Petya 
came 
running 
in 
from 
the 
drawing 
room.

Petya<p>
was 
now 
a 
handsome 
rosy 
lad 
of 
fifteen 
with 
full 
red 
lips 
and
resembled 
Natasha. 
He 
was 
preparing 
to 
enter 
the 
university, 
but 
he 
and
his 
friend 
Obolenski 
had 
lately, 
in 
<a href="/cZl/nHL3COCd3hQrxS2omA.html">secret,</a> 
agreed 
to 
join 
the 
hussars.

Petya 
had 
come 
rushing 
out 
to 
talk 
to 
his 
namesake 
about 
this 
affair.
He 
had 
asked 
Pierre 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
he 
would 
be 
accepted 
in 
the
hussars.

Pierre 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
the 
drawing 
room, 
not 
listening 
to 
what 
Petya
was 
saying.

Petya 
pulled 
him 
by 
the 
arm 
to 
attract 
his 
attention.

"Well, 
what 
about 
my 
plan? 
Peter 
Kirilych, 
for 
heaven's<p>
sake! 
You 
are 
my
only 
hope," 
said 
Petya.

"Oh 
yes, 
your 
plan. 
To 
join 
the 
hussars? 
I'll 
mention 
it, 
I'll 
bring<p>
it
all 
up 
today."

"Well, 
mon 
cher, 
have 
you 
got 
the 
manifesto?" 
asked 
the 
old 
count. 
"The
countess 
has 
been 
to 
Mass 
at 
the 
Razumovskis' 
and 
heard 
the 
new 
prayer.
She 
says 
it's 
very 
fine."

"Yes, 
I've 
got 
it," 
said 
Pierre. 
"The 
Emperor 
is 
to 
be 
here 
tomorrow...
there's 
to 
be 
an 
Extraordinary 
Meeting 
of 
the 
nobility, 
and 
they 
are
talking 
of

levy 
of 
ten 
men 
per

Oh

"Yes,

Well, 
and

"We 
are 
again 
retreating. 
They 
say 
we're 
already 
near 
Smolensk," 
replied
Pierre.

"O 
Lord, 
O 
Lord!" 
exclaimed 
the 
count. 
"Where 
is 
the 
manifesto?"

"The 
Emperor's 
appeal? 
Oh 
yes!"

Pierre 
began 
feeling 
in 
his 
pockets 
for 
the 
papers, 
but 
could 
not 
find
them. 
Still 
slapping 
his 
pockets, 
he 
kissed 
the 
hand 
of 
the<p>
countess
who 
entered 
the 
room 
and 
glanced 
uneasily 
around, 
evidently 
expecting
Natasha, 
who 
had 
left 
off 
singing 
but 
had 
not<p>
yet 
come 
into 
the 
drawing
room.

"On 
my 
<a href="/cZl/eI3e7.html">word,</a> 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
I've 
done 
with 
it," 
he 
said.

"There 
he 
is, 
always 
losing 
everything!" 
remarked 
the 
countess.

Natasha 
entered 
with 
a 
softened 
and 
agitated 
expression 
of 
face 
and
sat 
down<p>
looking 
silently 
at 
Pierre. 
As 
soon 
as 
she 
entered, 
Pierre's
features, 
which 
had 
been 
gloomy, 
suddenly 
lighted 
up, 
and 
while 
still
searching 
for 
the 
papers 
he 
glanced 
at 
her 
several 
times.

"No, 
really! 
I'll 
drive 
home, 
I 
must 
have 
left 
them 
there. 
I'll
certainly..."

"But 
you'll 
be 
late 
for 
dinner."

"Oh! 
And 
my 
coachman 
has 
gone."

But 
Sonya, 
who 
had 
gone 
to 
look 
for 
the 
papers 
in 
the 
anteroom, 
had
found 
them 
in 
Pierre's 
hat, 
where 
he 
had 
carefully 
tucked 
them 
under 
the
lining. 
Pierre 
was 
about 
to 
begin 
reading.

"No, 
after 
dinner," 
said 
the 
old 
count, 
evidently 
expecting 
much
enjoyment 
from 
that 
reading.

At 
dinner,

champagne 
was 
drunk 
to 
the

the

that 
there 
were 
no 
more 
charges.

"The 
scoundrels! 
What 
are 
they 
doing?" 
shouted 
the 
officer, 
turning 
to
Pierre.

The 
officer's 
face 
was 
red 
and 
perspiring 
and 
his 
eyes 
glittered 
under
his 
frowning 
brow.

"Run 
to 
the 
reserves 
and 
bring 
up 
the 
ammunition 
boxes!" 
he 
yelled,
angrily 
avoiding 
Pierre 
with 
his 
eyes 
and 
speaking 
to 
his 
men.

"I'll 
go," 
said 
Pierre.

The 
officer, 
without 
answering 
him, 
strode 
across 
to 
the 
opposite 
side.

"Don't 
fire.... 
Wait!" 
he 
shouted.

The 
man 
who 
had 
been 
ordered 
to 
go 
for 
ammunition 
stumbled 
against
Pierre.

"Eh, 
sir, 
this 
is 
no 
place 
for 
you," 
said 
he, 
and 
ran 
down 
the 
slope.

Pierre 
ran 
after 
him, 
avoiding 
the 
spot 
where 
the 
young 
officer 
was
sitting.

One 
cannon 
ball, 
another, 
and 
a 
third 
flew 
over 
him, 
falling 
in 
front,
beside, 
and 
behind 
him. 
Pierre 
ran 
down 
the 
slope. 
"Where 
am 
I 
going?"
he 
suddenly 
asked 
himself 
when 
he 
was 
already 
near 
the 
green 
ammunition
wagons. 
He 
halted 
irresolutely, 
not 
knowing 
whether 
to 
return 
or 
go 
on.
Suddenly 
a 
terrible 
concussion 
threw 
him 
backwards 
to 
the 
ground. 
At 
the
same 
instant 
he 
was 
dazzled 
by<p>
a 
great 
flash 
of 
flame, 
and 
immediately 
a
deafening 
roar, 
crackling, 
and 
whistling 
made 
his 
ears 
tingle.

When 
he 
came 
to 
himself 
he 
was 
sitting 
on 
the 
ground 
leaning 
on 
his
hands; 
the 
ammunition 
wagons 
he 
had 
been 
approaching 
no 
longer 
existed,
only 
charred 
green 
boards 
and 
rags<p>
littered 
the 
scorched 
grass, 
and 
a
horse, 
dangling 
fragments 
of 
its<p>
shaft 
behind 
it, 
galloped 
past, 
while
another 
horse 
lay, 
like 
Pierre, 
on 
the 
ground, 
uttering 
prolonged 
and
piercing 
cries.





CHAPTER 
XXXII

Beside 
himself 
with 
terror 
Pierre 
jumped 
up 
and 
ran 
back 
to 
the 
battery,
as 
to 
the 
only 
refuge 
from 
the 
horrors 
that 
surrounded 
him.

On 
entering 
the 
earthwork 
he 
noticed 
that 
there 
were 
men 
doing 
something
there 
but 
that 
no 
shots 
were 
being 
fired 
from 
the 
battery. 
He 
had 
no
time 
to 
realize 
who 
these 
men 
were. 
He<p>
saw 
the 
senior<p>
officer 
lying 
on
the 
earth<p>
wall 
with 
his 
back 
turned 
as 
if 
he 
were 
examining 
something
down 
below 
and 
that 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers 
he 
had 
noticed 
before 
was
struggling 
forward 
shouting 
"Brothers!" 
and 
trying 
to 
free 
himself 
from
some 
men 
who 
were 
holding 
him 
by 
the 
arm. 
He 
also 
saw 
something 
else
that 
was 
strange.

But 
he 
had 
not 
time 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
colonel 
had 
been 
killed, 
that
the 
soldier 
shouting 
"Brothers!" 
was 
a 
prisoner, 
and 
that 
another 
man
had 
been 
bayoneted 
in 
the 
back 
before 
his 
eyes, 
for 
hardly 
had 
he 
run
into 
the 
redoubt 
before 
a 
thin, 
sallow-faced, 
perspiring 
man 
in 
a 
blue
uniform 
rushed<p>
<a href="/cZl/oOe57E0s.html">on</a> 
him 
sword 
in 
hand, 
shouting 
something. 
Instinctively
guarding 
against 
the 
shock-for 
they 
had 
been 
running 
together 
at 
full
speed 
before 
they 
saw 
one 
another-Pierre 
put 
out 
his 
hands 
and 
seized
the 
man 
(a 
French 
officer) 
by 
the 
shoulder 
with 
one 
hand 
and 
by 
the
throat 
with 
the 
other.

spoke 
to 
a</h1>general 
who 
approached 
him, 
and 
began 
explaining
the 
whole 
position 
of 
our 
troops. 
Pierre 
listened 
to 
him, 
straining 
each
faculty 
to 
understand 
the 
essential 
points 
of 
the

He 
could 
make 
nothing

Bennigsen 
stopped 
speaking 
and,
noticing 
that 
Pierre 
was 
listening, 
suddenly 
said 
to 
him:

"I 
don't 
think 
this 
interests 
you?"

"On 
the 
contrary 
it's 
very 
interesting!" 
replied 
Pierre 
not 
quite
truthfully.

From 
the 
fleches 
they 
rode 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UK9Z7Uo.html">still</a> 
farther 
to 
the 
left, 
along 
a 
road
winding 
through 
a 
thick, 
low-growing 
birch 
wood. 
<a href="/aVzUge/gc1vf0sVDPn3.html">In</a> 
the

of

a 
brown 
hare 
with

sprang 
out 
and, 
scared 
by 
the 
tramp 
of
the 
many 
horses, 
grew 
so<p>
confused 
that 
it 
leaped 
along 
the 
road 
in

of 
them 
for 
some 
time, 
arousing 
general 
attention

<a href="/cZl/Cw38mTUVM5WVP.html">laughter,</a>

only
when 
several 
voices 
shouted 
at 
it 
did 
it 
dart 
to 
one 
side 
and 
disappear
in 
the 
thicket. 
After 
going 
through 
the 
wood 
for 
about 
a 
mile 
and 
a 
half
they 
came 
out 
on 
a 
glade 
where 
troops 
of 
Tuchkov's 
corps 
were 
stationed
to 
defend 
the 
left 
flank.

Here, 
at 
the 
extreme 
left 
flank, 
Bennigsen 
talked 
a 
great 
deal 
and 
with
much 
heat, 
and, 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
Pierre, 
gave 
orders 
of 
great<p>
military
importance. 
In 
front 
of 
Tuchkov's 
troops 
was 
some 
high 
ground 
not
occupied 
by 
troops. 
Bennigsen 
loudly 
criticized 
this 
mistake, 
saying
that 
it 
was 
madness 
to 
leave 
a 
height 
which 
commanded 
the 
country 
around
unoccupied 
and 
to 
place 
troops 
below 
it. 
Some 
of 
the 
generals 
expressed
the 
same 
opinion. 
One 
in 
particular 
declared 
with 
martial 
heat 
that 
they
were 
put 
there 
to 
be 
slaughtered. 
Bennigsen 
on 
his 
own 
authority 
ordered
the 
troops 
to 
occupy 
the 
high 
ground. 
This 
disposition 
on 
the 
left 
flank
increased 
Pierre's 
doubt 
of 
his 
own 
capacity 
to 
understand 
military
matters. 
Listening 
to 
Bennigsen 
and 
the 
generals 
criticizing 
the
position 
of 
the 
troops 
behind 
the 
hill, 
he 
quite 
understood 
them 
and
shared 
their 
opinion, 
but 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
he 
could 
not 
understand
how 
the 
man 
who 
put 
them 
there 
behind 
the 
hill 
could 
have 
made 
so 
gross
and 
palpable 
a 
blunder.

Pierre 
did 
not 
know 
that

troops

whole 
regiment. 
Impelled 
by 
the
crowd, 
they 
had 
got 
wedged 
in 
at 
the 
approach 
to 
the 
dam 
and, 
jammed 
in
on 
all 
sides, 
had 
stopped 
because 
a 
horse 
in 
front 
had 
fallen 
under 
a
cannon<p>
and 
the 
crowd 
were 
dragging 
it 
out. 
A 
cannon 
ball 
killed 
someone
behind 
them, 
another 
fell 
in 
front 
and 
splashed 
Dolokhov 
with 
blood.
The 
crowd, 
pushing 
forward 
desperately, 
squeezed 
together, 
moved 
a 
few
steps, 
and 
again 
stopped.

"Move 
on 
a 
hundred 
yards 
and 
we 
are 
certainly 
saved, 
remain 
here
another 
two 
minutes 
and 
it 
is 
certain 
death," 
thought 
each 
one.

Dolokhov 
who 
was 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
crowd 
forced 
his 
way 
to 
the 
edge
of 
the

throwing 
two 
soldiers 
off 
their 
feet,

already 
so

the 
expression

his 
face 
could 
be

And 
the 
excited,
alien 
face 
of 
that 
man, 
his 
bayonet 
hanging 
down, 
holding 
his 
breath,
and 
running 
so 
lightly, 
frightened 
Rostov. 
He 
seized 
his 
pistol 
and,
instead 
of 
firing 
it, 
flung 
it 
at 
the 
Frenchman 
and 
ran 
with 
all 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rq98AkS8C.html">his
might</a> 
toward 
the 
bushes. 
He 
did 
not

the 
feeling 
of 
doubt
and 
conflict 
with 
which 
he 
had 
trodden 
the<p>
Enns 
bridge, 
but 
with 
the
feeling 
of 
a 
hare 
fleeing 
from 
the 
hounds. 
One 
single 
sentiment, 
that
of 
fear 
for 
his 
young<p>
and 
happy 
life, 
possessed 
his 
whole 
being. 
Rapidly
leaping 
the 
furrows, 
he 
fled 
across 
the 
field 
with 
the 
impetuosity 
he
used 
to 
show 
at 
catchplay, 
now 
and 
then 
turning 
his 
good-natured, 
pale,
young 
face 
to 
look 
back. 
A 
shudder 
of 
terror 
went 
through 
him: 
"No,
better 
not 
look," 
he 
thought, 
but 
having 
reached 
the 
bushes 
he 
glanced
round 
once 
more. 
The 
French 
had 
fallen 
behind, 
and 
just 
as 
he 
looked
round 
the 
first 
man 
changed 
his 
run 
to 
a 
walk 
and, 
turning, 
shouted
something 
loudly 
to 
a 
comrade 
farther 
back. 
Rostov 
paused. 
"No,
there's 
some 
mistake," 
thought 
he. 
"They 
can't 
have 
wanted 
to
kill 
me." 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
his 
left 
arm 
felt 
as 
heavy 
as 
if
a 
seventy-pound 
weight 
were 
tied 
to 
it. 
He 
could 
run 
no 
more. 
The
Frenchman 
also 
stopped 
and 
took 
aim. 
Rostov 
closed 
his 
eyes 
and 
stooped
down. 
One 
bullet 
and 
then 
another 
whistled 
past 
him. 
He 
mustered 
his
last 
remaining 
strength, 
took 
hold 
of 
his 
left 
hand 
with 
his 
right, 
and
reached 
the 
bushes. 
Behind 
these 
were 
some 
Russian 
sharpshooters.





CHAPTER 
XX

The 
infantry 
regiments 
that 
had 
been 
caught 
unawares 
in 
the 
outskirts
of 
the 
wood 
ran 
out 
of 
it, 
the 
different 
companies 
getting 
mixed, 
and
retreated 
as 
a 
disorderly 
crowd. 
One 
soldier, 
in 
his 
fear, 
uttered 
the
senseless 
cry, 
"Cut 
off!" 
that 
is 
so 
terrible 
in 
battle, 
and 
that
word 
infected 
the 
whole 
crowd 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
panic.

"Surrounded! 
Cut 
off? 
We're 
lost!" 
shouted 
the 
fugitives.

The 
moment 
he 
heard 
the 
firing 
and 
the 
cry 
from 
behind, 
the 
general
realized 
that 
something 
dreadful 
had 
happened 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oh2to5lFuWA.html">his</a> 
regiment, 
and 
the
thought 
that 
he, 
an 
exemplary 
officer 
of 
many 
years' 
service 
who
had 
never 
been 
to 
blame, 
might<p>
be 
held 
responsible 
at 
headquarters
for 
negligence 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/GQe34bKMVG3tTlW.html">or</a> 
inefficiency 
so 
staggered 
him 
that, 
forgetting 
the
recalcitrant 
cavalry 
colonel, 
his 
own 
dignity 
as 
a 
general, 
and 
above
all 
quite 
forgetting 
the 
danger 
and 
all 
regard 
for 
self-preservation, 
he
clutched 
the 
crupper 
of 
his 
saddle 
and, 
spurring 
his 
horse, 
galloped 
to
the 
regiment 
under 
a 
hail 
of 
bullets 
which 
fell 
around, 
but 
fortunately
missed 
him. 
His 
one 
desire 
was 
to 
know 
what 
was 
happening<p>
and 
at 
any
cost

of

as</h1>the 
result 
of 
recognizing 
his 
rights, 
and 
the 
killing
of 
millions 
in 
Russia 
for 
the 
humiliation 
of 
England. 
But 
these
justifications 
have 
a 
very 
necessary 
significance 
in 
their 
own 
day.

These 
justifications 
release 
those 
who 
produce 
the 
events 
from 
moral
responsibility. 
These 
temporary 
aims 
are 
like 
the 
broom 
fixed 
in 
front
of 
a 
locomotive 
to 
clear 
the 
snow 
from 
the 
rails 
in 
front: 
they 
clear
men's 
moral 
responsibilities 
from 
their 
path.

Without 
such 
justification 
there 
would 
be 
no 
reply 
to 
the 
simplest
question 
that 
presents 
itself 
when 
examining 
each 
historical 
event. 
How
is 
it 
that 
millions 
of 
men 
commit 
collective 
crimes-make 
war, 
commit
murder, 
and 
so 
on?

With 
the 
present 
complex 
forms 
of 
political 
and 
social 
life 
in 
Europe
can 
any 
event 
that 
is 
not 
prescribed, 
decreed, 
or 
ordered 
by 
monarchs,
ministers, 
parliaments, 
or 
newspapers 
be 
imagined? 
Is 
there 
any
collective 
action 
which 
cannot 
find 
its 
justification 
in 
political
unity, 
in 
patriotism, 
in 
the 
balance 
of 
power, 
or 
in 
civilization? 
So
that 
every 
event 
that 
occurs 
inevitably 
coincides 
with 
some 
expressed
wish 
and, 
receiving 
a 
justification, 
presents 
itself 
as 
the 
result 
of
the 
will 
of 
one 
man 
or 
of 
several 
men.

added, 
"Let

we'll

had 
time 
to 
utter 
the 
joke 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
make 
on 
the

Natasha 
jumped 
up 
from

ran 
to 
her

"What

she 
cried,

him,

she 
again

at 
Pierre 
with 
the 
unconscious 
coquetry 
that 
had 
returned 
to 
her
with 
her 
better 
spirits.

"There! 
Here's 
a 
patriot 
for 
you!" 
said 
Shinshin.

"Not 
a 
patriot 
at 
all, 
but 
simply..." 
Natasha 
replied 
in 
an 
injured
tone. 
"Everything 
seems 
funny 
to 
you, 
but 
this 
isn't 
at 
all

"Let

We're

"But

you 
notice, 
it 
says, 
'for

said 
Pierre.

"Never 
mind 
what 
it's 
for...."

At 
this 
moment, 
Petya, 
to 
whom 
nobody 
was 
paying 
any 
attention, 
came 
up
to 
his 
father 
with 
a 
very 
flushed 
face 
and 
said 
in 
his 
breaking 
voice
that 
was 
now 
deep 
and 
now 
shrill:

"Well, 
Papa, 
I 
tell 
you 
definitely, 
and 
Mamma 
too, 
it's

The

in

looked 
up 
to

clasped 
her

turned 
angrily 
to

But

"Come,

"Here's

"It's

words,
"when

CHAPTER 
XX

After 
Pierre's 
departure 
that 
first 
evening, 
when<p>
Natasha 
had 
said<p>
to
Princess 
Mary 
with 
a 
gaily 
mocking 
smile: 
"He 
looks 
just, 
yes, 
just 
as
if 
he 
had 
come 
out 
of 
a 
Russian 
bath-in 
a 
short 
coat 
and 
with 
his 
hair
cropped," 
something 
hidden 
and 
unknown 
to 
herself, 
but 
irrepressible,
awoke 
in 
Natasha's 
soul.

Everything: 
her 
face, 
walk, 
<a href="/cZl/Wj2NDX9oP3vuxZ.html">look,</a> 
and 
voice, 
was 
suddenly 
altered.
To 
her 
own 
surprise 
a 
power 
of 
life 
and 
hope 
of 
happiness 
rose 
to 
the
surface<p>
and 
demanded 
satisfaction. 
From 
that 
evening 
she 
seemed 
to 
have
forgotten 
all 
that 
had 
happened 
to 
her. 
She 
no 
longer 
complained 
of<p>
her
position, 
did 
not 
say 
a 
word 
about 
the 
past, 
and 
no 
longer 
feared 
to
make 
happy 
plans 
for 
the 
future. 
She 
spoke 
little 
of 
Pierre, 
but 
when
Princess 
Mary 
mentioned 
him 
a<p>
long-extinguished 
light 
once 
more 
kindled

change 
that 
took

at

Mary;
but

it 
grieved 
her.

native 
land
was 
too 
far 
off, 
and 
for 
a 
man 
going 
a 
thousand 
miles 
it 
is 
absolutely
necessary 
to 
set 
aside 
his 
final 
goal 
and 
to 
say 
to 
himself: 
"Today 
I
shall 
get 
to 
a 
place 
twenty-five 
miles 
off 
where 
I 
shall 
rest 
and
spend 
the 
night," 
and 
during 
the 
first 
day's 
journey 
that 
resting 
place
eclipses<p>
his 
ultimate 
goal 
and 
attracts 
all 
his 
hopes 
and 
desires. 
And
the 
impulses 
felt 
by 
a 
single 
person 
are 
always 
magnified 
in 
a 
crowd.

For 
the 
French 
retreating 
along 
the 
old 
Smolensk 
road, 
the 
final
goal-their 
native 
land-was 
too 
remote, 
<a href="/cZl/Je29s0aAcKW.html">and</a> 
their 
immediate 
goal
was 
Smolensk, 
toward 
which 
all 
their 
desires 
and 
hopes, 
enormously
intensified 
in 
the 
mass, 
urged 
them 
on. 
It 
was 
not 
that 
they 
knew 
that
much 
food 
and 
fresh 
troops 
awaited 
them 
in 
Smolensk, 
nor 
that 
they 
were
told 
so 
(on 
the 
contrary 
their 
superior 
officers, 
and 
Napoleon 
himself,
knew 
that 
provisions 
were<p>
scarce 
there), 
but 
because 
this 
alone 
could
give 
them<p>
strength 
to 
move 
on 
and 
endure 
their 
present 
privations. 
So
both 
those 
who 
knew 
and 
those 
who 
did 
not 
know 
deceived<p>
themselves, 
and
pushed 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Nc1ikR9pXQvm6bUI.html">to</a> 
Smolensk 
as 
to 
a 
promised 
land.

Coming 
out 
onto 
the 
highroad<p>
the 
French 
fled 
<a href="/aVzUge/SX7b6Cr5a.html">with</a> 
surprising 
energy
and 
unheard-of 
rapidity 
toward 
the 
goal 
they 
had 
fixed 
on. 
Besides 
the
common 
impulse 
which 
bound 
the 
whole 
crowd 
of 
French 
into 
one 
mass 
and
supplied 
them<p>
with 
a 
certain 
energy, 
there 
was 
another 
cause 
binding
them 
together-their 
great 
numbers. 
As 
with 
the 
<a href="/cZl/vf3gJL1H5UTE.html">physical</a> 
law 
of 
gravity,
their 
enormous 
mass 
drew 
the 
individual 
human 
atoms 
to 
itself. 
In 
their
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
they 
moved 
like 
a 
whole 
nation.

Each 
of 
them 
desired 
nothing 
more 
than 
to 
give 
himself 
up 
as<p>
a 
prisoner
to 
escape 
from 
all 
this 
horror 
and 
misery; 
but 
on 
the 
one 
hand 
the 
force
of 
this 
common 
attraction 
to 
Smolensk, 
their 
goal, 
drew<p>
each 
of 
them 
in
the 
same 
direction; 
on 
the 
other 
hand 
an 
army 
corps 
could 
not 
surrender
to 
a 
company, 
and 
though 
the 
French 
availed 
themselves<p>
of 
every
convenient 
opportunity 
to 
detach 
themselves 
and 
to 
surrender 
on 
the
slightest 
decent 
pretext, 
such 
pretexts 
did 
not 
always 
occur. 
Their
very 
numbers 
and 
their 
crowded 
and 
swift<p>
movement 
deprived 
them 
of 
that
possibility 
and 
rendered 
it 
not 
only 
difficult 
but 
impossible 
for 
the
Russians 
to 
stop 
this 
movement, 
to 
which 
the 
French 
were 
directing 
all
their 
energies. 
Beyond 
a 
certain 
limit 
no<p>
mechanical 
disruption 
of 
the
body 
could 
hasten 
the 
process 
of 
decomposition.

memorable 
week, 
there 
had 
been 
the 
extraordinary 
autumn 
weather 
that
always 
comes 
as 
a 
surprise, 
when 
the 
sun 
hangs 
low

gives 
more

dark 
warm

golden 
stars 
startle 
and
delight 
us 
continually 
by 
falling 
from 
the

At 
ten 
in 
the 
morning 
of 
the 
second 
of 
September 
this 
weather 
still
held.

The 
brightness 
of 
the 
morning 
was 
magical. 
Moscow 
seen 
from 
the 
Poklonny
Hill 
lay 
spaciously 
spread 
out 
with 
her 
river, 
her 
gardens, 
and 
her
churches, 
and 
she 
seemed 
to 
be 
living 
her 
usual 
life, 
her 
cupolas
glittering 
like 
stars 
in 
the 
sunlight.

The 
view 
of 
the 
strange 
city 
with 
its 
peculiar 
architecture, 
such 
as
he 
had 
never 
seen 
before, 
filled 
Napoleon 
with 
the 
rather 
envious 
and
uneasy 
curiosity 
men 
feel 
when 
they 
see 
an 
alien 
form 
of 
life 
that 
has
no 
knowledge 
of 
them. 
This 
city 
was 
evidently 
living 
with 
the 
full 
force
of 
its 
own 
life. 
By 
the 
indefinite 
signs 
which, 
even 
at 
a 
distance,
distinguish 
a 
living 
body 
from 
a 
dead 
one, 
Napoleon 
from 
the 
Poklonny
Hill 
perceived 
the 
throb 
of 
life 
in<p>
the 
town 
and 
felt, 
as 
it 
were, 
the
breathing 
of 
that 
great 
and 
beautiful 
body.

Every 
Russian 
looking 
at 
Moscow 
feels 
her 
to 
be 
a 
mother; 
every
foreigner 
who 
sees 
her,<p>
even 
if 
ignorant 
of 
her 
significance 
as 
the
mother 
city, 
must 
feel 
her 
feminine 
character, 
and 
Napoleon 
felt 
it.

"Cette 
ville 
asiatique 
aux 
innombrables 
eglises, 
Moscou 
la 
sainte. 
La
voila 
donc 
enfin, 
cette 
fameuse 
ville! 
Il 
etait 
temps," 
* 
said 
he, 
and
dismounting 
he 
ordered<p>
a 
plan 
of 
Moscow 
to 
be 
spread 
out 
before 
him, 
and
summoned 
Lelorgne 
d'Ideville, 
the 
interpreter.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"That 
Asiatic 
city 
of 
the 
innumerable 
churches, 
holy
 
 
 
 
 
Moscow! 
Here 
it 
is 
then 
at 
last, 
that 
famous 
city. 
It 
was
 
 
 
 
 
high 
time."


"A 
town 
captured 
by 
the 
enemy 
is 
like 
a 
maid 
who 
has 
lost 
her 
honor,"
thought 
he 
(he 
had 
said 
so 
to 
Tuchkov 
at 
Smolensk). 
From 
that 
point 
of
view 
he 
gazed 
at 
the 
Oriental 
beauty 
he 
had 
not 
seen 
before. 
It 
seemed
strange 
to 
him 
that 
his 
long-felt 
wish, 
which 
had 
seemed 
unattainable,
had 
at 
last 
been 
realized. 
In 
the 
clear 
morning 
light 
he 
gazed 
now 
at
the 
city 
and 
now 
at 
the 
plan, 
considering<p>
its 
details, 
and 
the 
assurance
of 
possessing 
it 
agitated 
and<p>
awed 
him.

"But 
could 
it 
be 
otherwise?" 
he 
thought. 
"Here 
is 
this 
capital 
at 
my
feet. 
Where 
is 
Alexander 
now, 
and 
of

and 
a

moment! 
In 
what
light 
must 
I 
appear 
to 
them!" 
thought 
he, 
thinking 
of 
his 
troops.
"Here

for 
all

fainthearted 
men,"

In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
day 
Murat 
sent 
his 
adjutant 
to 
Napoleon 
to 
demand
reinforcements.

Napoleon 
sat 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
knoll, 
drinking 
punch, 
when 
Murat's
adjutant 
galloped 
up 
with 
an 
assurance 
that 
the 
Russians 
would

routed
if 
His 
Majesty 
would 
let 
him 
have 
another

"Reinforcements?" 
said 
Napoleon 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
stern 
surprise, 
looking 
at
the 
adjutant-a 
handsome 
lad 
with 
long 
black 
curls 
arranged 
like 
Murat's
own-as 
though 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
his 
words.

"Reinforcements!" 
thought 
Napoleon 
to 
himself. 
"How 
can 
they 
need
reinforcements 
when 
they 
already 
have 
half 
the 
army 
directed 
against 
a
weak, 
unentrenched 
Russian 
wing?"

"Tell 
the 
King 
of 
Naples," 
said 
he 
sternly, 
"that 
it 
is 
not 
noon 
yet,
and 
I 
don't 
yet 
see 
my 
chessboard

Go!..."

The 
handsome 
boy 
adjutant 
with 
the 
long 
hair 
sighed 
deeply 
without
removing 
his 
hand 
from 
his 
hat 
and 
galloped 
back 
to 
where 
men 
were 
being
slaughtered.

Napoleon 
rose 
and 
having 
summoned 
Caulaincourt 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gSO9NPT7QD3O.html">Berthier</a> 
began
talking 
to 
them 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">about</a> 
matters 
unconnected 
with 
the 
battle.

In 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
conversation, 
which 
was 
beginning 
to 
interest
Napoleon, 
Berthier's 
eyes 
turned 
to 
look 
at 
a 
general 
with 
a 
suite, 
who
was 
galloping 
toward 
the 
knoll 
on 
a 
lathering 
horse. 
It 
was 
Belliard.
Having 
dismounted 
he 
went 
up 
to 
the 
Emperor 
with 
rapid 
strides 
and 
in
a 
loud 
voice 
began 
boldly 
demonstrating 
the 
necessity 
of 
sending
reinforcements. 
He 
swore 
on 
his 
honor 
that 
the 
Russians 
were<p>
lost 
if 
the
Emperor 
would 
give 
another 
division.

Napoleon

his

it</h1>necessary 
to 
tell 
Natasha 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
wound 
and 
of 
his 
being
with 
their 
party. 
The 
countess 
had 
seldom 
been 
so 
angry 
with 
anyone 
as
she 
was 
with 
Sonya. 
Sonya 
had 
cried 
and 
begged 
to 
be 
forgiven 
and 
now,
as 
if 
trying 
to 
atone 
for 
her 
fault, 
paid 
unceasing 
attention 
to 
her
cousin.

"Look, 
Natasha, 
how 
dreadfully 
it 
is 
burning!" 
said 
she.

"What's 
burning?" 
asked 
Natasha. 
"Oh, 
yes, 
Moscow."

And 
as 
if<p>
in 
order 
not 
to 
offend 
Sonya 
and 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
her, 
she 
turned
her 
face 
to 
the 
window, 
looked 
out 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
it 
was 
evident
that 
she 
could 
not 
see 
anything, 
and 
again 
settled 
down 
in 
her<p>
former
attitude.

"But 
you 
didn't 
see 
it!"

"Yes, 
really 
I 
did," 
Natasha 
replied 
in 
a 
voice 
that 
pleaded 
to 
be 
left
in 
peace.

Both 
the 
countess 
and 
Sonya 
understood 
that, 
naturally, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EP6vf2J1gcnoA.html">neither</a> 
Moscow
nor 
the 
burning 
of 
Moscow 
nor 
anything 
else 
could 
seem 
of 
importance 
to
Natasha.

The 
count 
returned 
and 
lay 
down 
behind 
the 
partition. 
The 
countess 
went
up 
to 
her 
daughter 
and 
touched 
her 
head 
with 
the 
back 
of 
her 
hand 
as 
she
was 
wont 
to 
do 
when 
Natasha 
was 
ill, 
then 
touched 
her 
forehead 
with 
her
lips 
as 
if 
to 
feel 
whether 
she 
was 
feverish, 
and 
finally 
kissed 
her.

"You 
are 
cold. 
You 
are 
trembling 
all 
over. 
You'd 
better 
lie 
down," 
<a href="/cZl/Uc3Gj58ogilO.html">said
the</a> 
countess.

"Lie 
down? 
All 
right, 
I 
will. 
I'll 
lie 
down 
at 
once," 
said 
Natasha.

When 
Natasha 
had 
been 
told 
that 
morning 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
seriously
wounded 
and 
was<p>
traveling 
with 
their 
party, 
she 
had 
at 
first 
asked 
many
questions: 
Where 
was 
he 
going? 
How 
was 
he 
wounded? 
Was 
it 
serious? 
And
could 
she 
see 
him? 
But 
after 
she 
had 
been 
told 
that 
she 
could 
not 
see
him, 
that 
he 
was 
seriously 
wounded 
but 
that 
his 
life 
was 
not 
in 
danger,
she 
ceased 
to 
ask 
questions 
or 
to 
speak 
at 
all, 
evidently 
disbelieving
what 
they 
told 
her, 
and 
convinced 
that 
say 
what 
she 
might 
she 
would
still 
be 
told 
the 
same. 
All 
the 
way 
she 
had 
sat 
motionless 
in 
a 
corner
of<p>
the 
coach 
with 
wide 
open 
eyes, 
and 
the 
expression 
in 
them 
which 
the
countess 
knew 
so 
well 
and 
feared 
so

on

This 
path 
led 
to 
the 
barn. 
The 
log
walls 
of 
the 
barn 
and 
its 
snow-covered 
roof, 
that 
looked 
as 
if 
hewn 
out
of 
some 
precious<p>
stone, 
sparkled 
in 
the 
moonlight. 
A 
tree 
in 
the 
garden
snapped 
with 
the 
frost, 
and 
then 
all 
was 
again 
perfectly 
silent. 
His
bosom 
seemed 
to 
inhale 
not 
air 
but 
the 
strength 
of 
eternal 
youth 
and
gladness.

From 
the 
back 
porch 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
feet 
descending 
the 
steps, 
the
bottom 
step 
upon 
which 
snow 
had 
fallen 
gave 
a 
ringing 
creak 
and 
he 
heard
the 
voice 
of 
an 
old 
maidservant 
saying, 
"Straight, 
straight, 
along 
the
path, 
Miss. 
Only, 
don't 
look 
back."

"I 
am 
not 
afraid," 
answered 
Sonya's 
voice, 
and 
along 
the 
path
toward 
Nicholas 
came 
the 
crunching, 
whistling 
sound 
of 
Sonya's 
feet
in 
her 
thin 
shoes.

Sonya 
came 
along, 
wrapped 
in 
her 
cloak. 
She 
was 
only 
a 
couple 
of 
paces
away 
when 
she 
saw 
him, 
and 
to 
her 
too 
he 
was 
not 
the 
Nicholas 
she 
had
known 
and 
always 
slightly 
feared. 
He 
was 
in 
a 
woman's 
dress, 
with
tousled 
hair 
and 
a 
happy<p>
smile 
new 
to 
Sonya. 
She 
ran 
rapidly 
toward
him.

"Quite 
different 
and 
yet 
the 
same," 
thought 
Nicholas, 
looking 
at 
her
face 
all 
lit 
up 
by 
the 
moonlight. 
He 
slipped 
his 
arms 
under 
the 
cloak
that 
covered 
her 
head, 
embraced 
her, 
pressed 
her 
to 
him, 
and 
kissed 
her
on 
the 
lips 
that 
wore 
a 
mustache 
and 
had 
a 
smell 
of 
burnt 
cork. 
Sonya
kissed 
him 
full 
on 
the 
lips, 
and 
disengaging 
her 
little 
hands 
pressed
them 
to 
his 
cheeks.

"Sonya!... 
Nicholas!"... 
was 
all 
they 
said. 
They 
ran 
to 
the 
barn
and 
then 
back 
again, 
re-entering, 
he 
by 
the 
front 
and 
she 
by 
the 
back
porch.





CHAPTER 
XII

When 
they 
all 
drove 
back 
from 
Pelageya 
Danilovna's, 
Natasha, 
who
always 
saw 
and 
noticed 
everything, 
arranged 
that 
she 
and 
Madame 
Schoss
should 
go 
back 
in 
the 
sleigh 
with 
Dimmler, 
and 
Sonya 
with 
Nicholas 
and
the 
maids.

On 
the 
way 
back 
Nicholas 
drove 
at 
a 
steady 
pace 
instead 
of 
racing 
and
kept 
peering 
by 
that 
fantastic 
all-transforming 
light 
into 
Sonya's
face 
and 
searching 
beneath 
the 
eyebrows 
and 
mustache 
for 
his 
former 
and
his 
present 
Sonya 
from 
whom 
he 
had 
resolved 
never<p>
to 
be 
parted 
again.
He 
looked 
and 
recognizing 
in<p>
her 
both 
the 
old 
and 
the 
new 
Sonya, 
and
being 
reminded 
by 
the 
smell 
of 
burnt 
cork 
of 
the 
sensation 
of 
her 
kiss,
inhaled 
the 
frosty 
air 
with 
a 
full 
breast 
and, 
looking 
at 
the 
ground
flying 
beneath 
him 
and 
at<p>
the 
sparkling 
sky, 
felt 
himself 
again 
in
fairyland.

"Sonya, 
is 
it 
well 
with 
thee?" 
he 
asked 
from 
time 
to 
time.

"Yes!" 
she 
replied. 
"And<p>
with 
thee?"

When 
halfway 
home 
Nicholas 
handed 
the 
reins 
to 
the 
coachman 
and 
ran 
for
a 
moment 
to 
Natasha's 
sleigh 
and 
stood 
on 
its 
wing.

"Natasha!" 
he 
whispered 
in 
French, 
"do 
you 
know 
I 
have 
made 
up 
my
mind 
about 
Sonya?"

"Have 
you 
told 
her?" 
asked 
Natasha, 
suddenly 
beaming 
all 
over 
with
joy.

"Oh, 
how 
strange 
you 
are 
with 
that 
mustache 
and 
those 
eyebrows!...
Natasha-are 
you 
glad?"

"I 
am 
so 
glad, 
so 
glad! 
I 
was 
beginning 
to 
be 
vexed 
with 
you. 
I 
did
not 
tell 
you, 
but 
you 
have 
been 
treating 
her 
badly. 
What 
a 
heart 
she
has,<p>
Nicholas! 
I 
am 
horrid 
sometimes, 
but 
I 
was 
ashamed 
to 
be 
happy
while 
Sonya 
was 
not," 
continued 
Natasha. 
"Now 
I 
am 
so 
glad! 
Well,
run 
back 
to 
her."

"No, 
wait 
a 
bit.... 
Oh, 
how 
funny 
you 
look!"

Nicholas,

into 
her 
face

Without 
replying 
either 
to 
his 
wife 
or 
his 
mother-in-law, 
Pierre 
late
one 
night 
prepared 
for 
a 
journey 
and 
started 
for 
Moscow 
to 
see 
Joseph
Alexeevich. 
This 
is 
what 
he 
noted<p>
in 
his 
diary:

Moscow, 
17th 
November

I 
have 
just 
returned 
from 
my 
benefactor, 
and 
hasten 
to 
write 
down 
<a href="/aVzUge/oC5mGGRm7vxtj7Qb.html">what</a> 
I
have 
experienced. 
Joseph 
Alexeevich 
is 
living 
poorly 
and 
has 
for 
three
years 
been 
suffering 
from 
a 
painful 
disease 
of 
the 
bladder. 
No 
one 
has
ever 
heard 
him 
utter 
a 
groan 
or 
a 
word 
of 
complaint. 
From 
morning 
till
late 
at 
night, 
except 
when 
he 
eats 
his 
very 
plain 
food, 
he 
is 
working
at 
science. 
He 
received 
me 
graciously 
and 
made 
me 
sit 
down 
on 
the 
bed
on 
which 
he 
lay. 
I 
made 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
Knights 
of 
the 
East 
and 
of
Jerusalem, 
and 
he 
responded 
in 
the 
same 
manner, 
asking 
me 
with 
a 
mild
smile 
what 
I 
had 
learned 
and 
gained 
in 
the 
Prussian 
and 
Scottish 
lodges.
I 
told 
him 
everything 
as 
best 
I 
could, 
and 
told 
him 
what 
I 
had 
proposed
to 
our 
Petersburg 
lodge, 
of 
the 
bad 
reception 
I 
had 
encountered, 
and 
of
my 
rupture 
with 
the 
Brothers. 
Joseph 
Alexeevich, 
having 
remained 
silent
and 
thoughtful 
for 
a 
good<p>
while, 
told 
me 
his 
view 
of 
the 
matter, 
which
at 
once 
lit 
up 
for 
me 
my 
whole 
past 
and 
the 
future 
path 
I 
should 
follow.
He 
surprised 
me 
by 
asking 
whether 
I 
remembered 
the 
threefold 
aim 
of
the 
order: 
(1) 
The 
preservation 
and 
study 
of 
the 
mystery. 
(2) 
The
purification 
and 
reformation 
of 
oneself 
for 
its 
reception, 
and 
(3) 
The
improvement 
of 
the 
human 
race 
by 
striving 
for 
such 
purification. 
Which
is 
the 
principal 
aim 
of 
these 
three? 
Certainly 
self-reformation 
and
self-purification. 
Only 
to 
this 
aim 
can 
we 
always 
strive 
independently
of 
circumstances. 
But 
at 
the 
same 
time 
just 
this 
aim 
demands 
the
greatest 
efforts 
of 
us; 
and 
so, 
led 
astray 
by 
pride, 
losing 
sight 
of
this 
aim, 
we 
occupy 
ourselves 
either 
with 
the 
mystery 
which 
in 
our
impurity<p>
we 
are 
unworthy 
to 
receive, 
or 
seek 
<a href="/aVzUge/uqv2NY3epgGc3jl.html">the</a> 
reformation 
of
the 
human 
race 
while

Illuminism 
is 
not

it 
is
attracted 
by 
social 
activity 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">and</a> 
puffed 
up 
by 
pride. 
On 
this 
ground
Joseph 
Alexeevich

my 
speech 
and 
my 
whole 
activity,

Flourishing

the

left

"Papa!

of

CHAPTER 
XVI

Berg, 
the 
Rostovs' 
son-in-law, 
was 
already 
a 
colonel 
wearing 
the 
orders
of 
Vladimir 
and 
Anna, 
and 
he 
still 
filled 
the 
quiet 
and 
agreeable 
post
of 
assistant 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
assistant 
commander 
of 
the
first 
division 
of 
the 
Second 
Army.

On 
the 
first 
of 
September 
he 
had 
come 
to 
Moscow 
from 
the 
army.

He 
had 
nothing 
to 
do 
in 
Moscow, 
but 
he 
had 
noticed 
that 
everyone 
in

army

"If 
Prince 
Andrew 
heard 
that 
I 
was 
in 
the 
power 
of 
the 
French! 
That
I, 
the 
daughter 
of 
Prince 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski, 
asked 
General 
Rameau 
for
protection 
and 
accepted 
his 
favor!" 
This 
idea 
horrified 
her, 
made 
her
shudder, 
blush, 
and 
feel 
such 
a 
rush 
of 
anger 
and 
pride 
as 
she 
had 
never
experienced 
before. 
All 
that 
was 
distressing, 
and 
especially 
all 
that
was 
humiliating, 
in 
her 
position 
rose 
vividly 
to 
her

"They, 
the
French,

M.

occupy

Andrew's

amuse 
himself 
by 
looking 
through 
and 
reading
his

Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
would 
do 
the 
honors 
of
Bogucharovo 
for 
him. 
I 
<a href="/cZl/xX9W8d6.html">should</a>

sorrow..." 
thought 
Princess 
Mary,
not 
thinking 
her 
own 
thoughts 
but 
feeling 
bound 
to 
think 
like 
her 
father
and 
her 
brother. 
For 
herself 
she 
did 
not 
care 
where 
she 
remained 
or 
what
happened 
to 
her, 
but 
she 
felt 
herself 
the 
representative 
of 
her 
dead
father 
and 
of 
Prince 
Andrew. 
Involuntarily 
she 
thought 
their 
thoughts
and 
felt 
their 
feelings. 
What 
they 
would 
have 
said 
and 
what 
they 
would
have 
done 
she 
felt 
bound 
to 
say 
and 
do. 
She 
went 
into 
Prince 
Andrew's
study, 
trying 
to 
enter 
completely 
into 
his 
ideas, 
and 
considered 
her
position.

The 
demands 
of 
life, 
which 
had 
seemed 
to 
her 
annihilated 
by 
her 
father's
death, 
all 
at 
once 
rose 
before 
her 
with 
a 
new, 
previously 
unknown 
force
and 
took 
possession 
of 
her.

Agitated 
and 
flushed 
she 
paced 
the 
room, 
sending 
now 
for 
Michael
Ivanovich 
and 
now 
for 
Tikhon 
or 
Dron. 
Dunyasha, 
the 
nurse, 
and 
the 
other
maids 
could 
not 
say 
in 
how 
far 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
statement 
was
correct. 
Alpatych 
was 
not 
at 
home, 
he 
had 
gone 
to 
the 
police. 
Neither
could 
the 
architect 
Michael 
Ivanovich, 
who 
on 
being 
sent 
for 
came 
in
with 
sleepy 
eyes, 
tell 
Princess 
Mary 
anything. 
With 
just 
the 
same 
smile
of 
agreement 
with 
which 
for 
fifteen 
years 
he 
had 
been 
accustomed 
to
answer 
the 
old 
prince 
without 
expressing 
views 
of 
his 
own, 
he 
now
replied 
to 
Princess 
Mary, 
so 
that 
nothing 
definite 
could 
be 
got 
from 
his
answers. 
The 
old 
valet 
Tikhon, 
with 
sunken, 
emaciated 
face 
that 
bore 
the
stamp 
of 
inconsolable 
grief, 
replied: 
"Yes, 
Princess" 
to 
all 
Princess
Mary's 
questions 
and 
hardly 
refrained 
from 
sobbing 
as 
he 
looked 
at 
her.

At 
length 
Dron, 
the 
village 
Elder, 
entered 
the 
room 
and 
with 
a 
deep 
bow
to 
Princess 
Mary 
came 
to 
a 
halt 
by 
the 
doorpost.

Princess 
Mary 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room 
and 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
him.

"Dronushka," 
she<p>
said, 
regarding 
as 
a 
sure 
friend 
this 
Dronushka 
who
always 
used 
to 
bring 
a 
special 
kind 
of 
gingerbread 
from 
his 
visit 
to 
the
fair 
at 
Vyazma 
every 
year 
and 
smilingly 
offer 
it 
to 
her, 
"Dronushka, 
now
since 
our 
misfortune..." 
she 
began, 
but 
could 
not 
go 
on.

"We 
are 
all 
in 
God's 
hands," 
said 
he, 
with 
a 
sigh.

They 
were 
silent 
for 
a 
while.

"Dronushka, 
Alpatych 
has 
gone 
off 
somewhere 
and 
I 
have 
no 
one 
to 
turn
to. 
Is 
it 
true, 
as 
they 
tell 
me, 
that 
I 
can't 
even 
go 
away?"

"Why 
shouldn't 
you 
go 
away, 
your 
excellency? 
You 
can 
go," 
said 
Dron.

"I 
was 
told 
it 
would 
be 
dangerous 
because 
of 
the 
enemy. 
Dear 
friend, 
I
can 
do 
nothing. 
I 
understand 
nothing. 
I 
have 
nobody! 
I 
want 
to 
go 
away
tonight 
or 
early 
tomorrow 
morning."

Dron 
paused.<p>
He 
looked 
askance 
at 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
said: 
"There 
are 
no
horses; 
I 
told 
Yakov 
Alpatych 
so."

"Why 
are 
there 
none?" 
asked 
the 
princess.

"It's 
all 
God's 
scourge," 
said 
Dron. 
"What 
horses 
we 
had 
have 
been
taken 
for 
the 
army 
or 
have 
died-this 
is 
such 
a 
year! 
It's 
not 
a

of
feeding 
horses-we 
may 
die 
of 
hunger 
ourselves!

He 
felt 
like 
a 
man 
who 
after 
straining 
his 
eyes 
to 
see 
into
the 
far 
distance 
finds 
what 
he 
sought 
at 
his 
very 
feet. 
All 
his 
life
he 
had 
looked 
over 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
men 
around 
him, 
when 
he 
should 
have
merely 
looked 
in 
front 
of 
him 
without 
straining 
his 
eyes.

In 
the 
past<p>
he 
had 
never 
been 
able 
to 
find 
that 
great 
inscrutable
infinite 
something. 
He 
had 
only 
felt 
that 
it 
must 
exist 
somewhere<p>
and
had 
looked 
for 
it.<p>
In 
everything 
near 
and 
comprehensible 
he 
had 
seen
only 
what 
was 
limited, 
petty, 
commonplace, 
and 
senseless. 
He 
had
equipped 
himself 
with 
a 
mental 
telescope 
and 
looked 
into 
remote 
space,
where 
petty 
worldliness 
hiding 
itself 
in 
misty 
distance 
had 
seemed 
to
him 
great 
and 
infinite 
merely 
because 
it 
was 
not 
clearly 
seen. 
And 
such
had 
European 
life, 
politics, 
Freemasonry, 
philosophy, 
and 
philanthropy
seemed 
to 
him. 
But 
even 
then, 
at 
moments 
of 
weakness 
as 
he 
had 
accounted
them, 
his 
mind 
had 
penetrated 
to 
those 
distances 
and 
he 
had 
there 
seen
the 
same 
pettiness, 
worldliness, 
and 
senselessness. 
Now, 
however, 
he
had 
learned 
to 
see 
the 
great, 
eternal, 
and 
infinite 
in 
everything, 
and
therefore-to 
see<p>
it 
and 
enjoy 
its 
contemplation-he 
naturally 
threw 
away
the 
telescope 
through 
which 
he 
had 
till 
now 
gazed 
over 
men's 
heads, 
and
gladly 
regarded 
the 
ever-changing, 
eternally 
great, 
unfathomable, 
and
infinite 
life 
around 
him. 
And 
the 
closer 
he 
looked 
the 
more 
tranquil 
and
happy 
he 
became. 
That 
dreadful 
question, 
"What 
for?" 
which 
had 
formerly
destroyed 
all 
his 
mental 
edifices, 
no 
longer 
existed 
for 
him. 
To 
that
question, 
<a href="/aVzUge/oC2mo4bvg3.html">"What</a> 
for?" 
a 
simple 
answer 
was 
now 
always 
ready 
in 
his 
soul:
"Because 
there 
is 
a 
God, 
that 
God 
without 
whose 
will 
not<p>
one

falls

In

Pierre 
had 
hardly 
changed 
at 
all. 
In 
appearance 
he
was 
just 
what 
he 
used

As

absent-minded

Prince 
Vasili 
much 
satisfaction.

Prince 
Vasili 
became 
thoughtful 
and 
frowned. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
saw 
that
he 
was 
afraid 
of 
finding 
in 
her 
a 
rival 
for 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
fortune,
and 
hastened 
to 
reassure 
him.

"If 
it 
were 
not 
for 
my 
sincere 
affection 
and 
devotion 
to 
Uncle,"
said 
she, 
uttering 
the 
word 
with 
peculiar 
assurance 
and 
unconcern, 
"I
know 
his 
character: 
noble, 
upright 
... 
but 
you 
see 
he 
has 
no 
one 
with
him 
except 
the 
young 
princesses.... 
They 
are 
still 
young...." 
She 
bent
her 
head 
and 
continued 
in 
a 
whisper: 
"Has 
he 
performed 
his 
final 
duty,
Prince? 
How 
priceless 
are 
those 
last 
moments! 
It 
can 
make 
things 
no
worse, 
and 
it 
is 
absolutely 
necessary 
to 
prepare 
him 
if 
he 
is 
so 
ill.
We 
women, 
Prince," 
and 
she 
smiled 
tenderly, 
"always

how 
to

these 
things. 
I 
absolutely 
must 
see 
him, 
however 
painful 
it 
may 
be 
for
me. 
I 
am

Evidently 
the 
prince 
understood 
her, 
and 
also 
understood, 
as 
he 
had 
done
at 
Anna 
Pavlovna's, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
Anna
Mikhaylovna.

"Would 
not 
such 
a

said 
he. 
"Let

"But

A

of 
one 
of 
the

opened 
and 
one 
of 
the 
princesses, 
the
count's 
niece, 
entered 
with 
a 
cold, 
stern 
face. 
The 
length 
of 
her
body 
was 
strikingly 
out 
of

to 
her 
short 
legs. 
Prince 
Vasili
turned 
to 
her.

"Well, 
how 
is 
he?"

"Still 
the

but 
what 
can 
you 
expect, 
this 
noise..." 
said 
the
princess, 
looking 
at 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
as 
at 
a 
stranger.

"Ah, 
my 
dear, 
I 
hardly 
knew 
you," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
with 
a
happy 
smile, 
ambling 
lightly 
up 
to 
the 
count's 
niece. 
"I

and 
she 
sympathetically 
turned 
up 
her 
eyes.

The

gave 
no

and 
did<p>
not 
even 
smile, 
but 
left 
the 
room 
as
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
took 
off 
her 
gloves 
and, 
occupying 
the 
position 
she
had 
conquered, 
settled 
down 
in

face 
again 
becoming
smooth 
as 
a 
sign 
that 
the 
conversation 
was 
at 
an 
end.

When 
Prince 
Andrew 
reached 
the 
room 
prepared 
for 
him 
and 
lay 
down 
in 
a
clean 
shirt 
on 
the 
feather 
bed 
with 
its 
warmed 
and 
fragrant 
pillows, 
he
felt 
that 
the 
battle 
of 
which 
he 
had 
brought 
tidings 
was 
far, 
far
away 
from 
him. 
The 
alliance 
with 
Prussia, 
Austria's 
treachery,
Bonaparte's 
new 
triumph, 
tomorrow's 
levee 
and 
parade, 
and 
the
audience 
with 
the 
Emperor<p>
Francis 
occupied 
his 
thoughts.

He 
closed 
his 
eyes, 
and 
immediately 
a 
sound 
of 
cannonading, 
of 
musketry
and 
the 
rattling 
of 
carriage 
wheels 
seemed 
to 
fill 
his 
ears, 
and 
now
again 
drawn 
out 
in 
a 
thin<p>
line 
the 
musketeers 
were 
descending 
the 
hill,
the 
French 
were 
firing, 
and 
he 
felt 
his 
heart 
palpitating 
as 
he 
rode
forward 
beside 
Schmidt 
with 
the 
bullets 
merrily 
whistling 
all 
around,
and 
he 
experienced 
tenfold 
the 
joy 
of 
living, 
as 
he 
had 
not 
done 
since
childhood.

He 
woke 
up...

"Yes, 
that 
all 
happened!" 
he 
said, 
and, 
smiling 
happily 
to 
himself
like 
a 
child, 
he 
fell 
into 
a 
deep, 
youthful 
slumber.





CHAPTER 
XI

Next 
day 
he 
woke 
late. 
Recalling 
his 
recent 
impressions, 
the 
first
thought 
that 
came 
into 
his 
mind 
was 
that 
today 
he 
had 
to 
be 
presented
to 
the 
Emperor 
Francis; 
he 
remembered 
the 
Minister 
of 
War, 
the 
polite
Austrian 
adjutant, 
Bilibin, 
and 
last 
night's 
conversation. 
Having
dressed 
for 
his 
attendance 
at 
court 
in 
full 
parade 
uniform, 
which 
he
had 
not 
worn 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
he 
went 
into 
Bilibin's 
study 
fresh,
animated, 
and 
handsome, 
with 
his 
hand 
bandaged. 
In 
the 
study 
were 
four
gentlemen 
of 
the 
diplomatic 
corps. 
With 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
Kuragin,
who 
was 
a 
secretary 
to 
the 
embassy, 
Bolkonski 
was 
already 
acquainted.
Bilibin 
introduced 
him 
to 
the 
others.

The 
gentlemen 
assembled 
at 
Bilibin's 
were 
young, 
wealthy, 
gay 
society
men, 
who 
here, 
as 
in 
Vienna, 
formed 
a 
special 
set 
which 
Bilibin, 
their
leader, 
called 
les 
notres. 
* 
This 
set, 
consisting 
almost 
exclusively 
of
diplomats, 
evidently 
had 
its 
own 
interests<p>
which 
had 
nothing<p>
to 
do 
with
war 
or 
politics 
but 
related 
to 
high 
society, 
to 
certain 
women, 
and 
to
the 
official 
side 
of 
the 
service. 
These 
gentlemen 
received 
Prince
Andrew 
as 
one 
of 
themselves, 
an 
honor 
they 
did 
not 
extend 
to 
many. 
From
politeness 
and 
to 
start<p>
conversation, 
they 
asked 
him 
a 
few 
questions
about 
the 
army 
and 
the 
battle, 
and 
then 
the 
talk 
went 
off 
into 
merry
jests 
and 
gossip.

 
 
 
 
* 
Ours.

"But 
the 
best 
of 
it 
was," 
said 
one, 
telling 
of 
the 
misfortune 
of
a 
fellow 
diplomat, 
"that 
the 
Chancellor 
told 
him 
flatly 
that 
his
appointment 
to 
London 
was 
a 
promotion 
and 
that 
he 
was 
so 
to 
regard 
it.
Can 
you 
fancy 
the<p>
figure 
he 
cut?..."

"But 
the 
worst 
of 
it, 
gentlemen-I 
am 
giving 
Kuragin 
away 
to
you-is 
that 
that 
man 
suffers, 
and 
this 
Don 
Juan, 
wicked 
fellow, 
is
taking 
advantage 
of<p>
it!"

Prince 
Hippolyte 
was 
lolling 
in 
a 
lounge

the 
performance, 
and 
Natasha 
moved 
over 
to
it.

The 
scene 
of 
the 
third 
act 
represented 
a 
palace 
in 
which 
many 
candles
were 
burning 
and 
pictures 
of 
knights 
with 
short 
beards 
hung 
on 
the
walls. 
In 
the 
middle 
stood 
what 
were 
probably 
a 
king 
and 
a 
queen. 
The
king 
waved 
his 
right 
arm 
and, 
evidently<p>
nervous, 
sang 
something 
badly
and 
sat 
down 
on 
a 
crimson 
throne. 
The 
maiden 
who 
had 
been 
first 
in 
white
and 
then 
in 
light 
blue, 
now 
wore 
only 
a 
smock, 
and 
stood 
beside 
the
throne 
with 
her 
hair 
down. 
She 
sang 
something 
mournfully, 
addressing 
the
queen, 
but 
the 
king 
waved 
his 
arm 
severely, 
and 
men 
and 
women 
with 
bare
legs 
came 
in 
from 
both 
sides 
and 
began 
dancing 
all 
together. 
Then 
the
violins 
played 
very 
shrilly 
and 
merrily 
and 
one 
of 
the 
women 
with 
thick
bare 
legs 
and 
thin 
arms, 
separating 
from 
the 
others, 
went 
behind 
the
wings, 
adjusted 
her 
bodice, 
returned 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
stage, 
and
began<p>
jumping 
and 
striking 
one 
foot 
rapidly 
against 
the 
other. 
In 
the
stalls 
everyone 
clapped 
and 
shouted 
"bravo!" 
Then 
one 
of 
the 
men
went 
into 
a 
corner 
of 
the 
stage. 
The 
cymbals 
and 
horns 
in 
the 
orchestra
struck 
up 
more 
loudly, 
and 
this 
man 
with 
bare 
legs 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/WU8DbPtL3As.html">jumped</a> 
very 
high 
and
waved 
his 
feet 
about 
very 
rapidly. 
(He 
was 
Duport, 
who 
received 
sixty
thousand 
rubles 
a 
year 
for 
this 
art.) 
Everybody 
in 
the 
stalls, 
boxes,
and 
galleries 
began 
clapping 
and 
shouting 
with 
all 
their 
might, 
and 
the
man 
stopped 
and 
began 
smiling 
and 
bowing 
to 
all 
sides.<p>
Then 
other 
men
and 
women 
danced 
with 
bare 
legs. 
Then 
the 
king 
again 
shouted 
to 
the
sound 
<a href="/aVzUge/Og9w11xhL.html">of</a> 
music, 
and 
they 
all 
began 
singing. 
But 
suddenly 
a 
storm
came 
on, 
chromatic 
scales 
and 
diminished 
sevenths 
were 
heard 
in 
the
orchestra, 
everyone 
ran 
off, 
again 
dragging 
one 
of 
their 
number 
away,
and 
the 
curtain 
dropped. 
Once 
more 
there 
was 
a 
terrible 
noise 
and
clatter 
among 
the 
audience, 
and 
with 
rapturous 
faces 
everyone 
began
shouting: 
"Duport! 
Duport! 
Duport!" 
Natasha 
no 
longer 
thought 
this
strange. 
She 
looked 
about 
with 
pleasure, 
smiling 
joyfully.

"Isn't 
Duport 
delightful?" 
Helene 
asked 
her.

"Oh, 
yes," 
replied 
Natasha.





CHAPTER 
X

During 
the 
entr'acte 
a 
whiff 
of 
cold 
air 
came 
into 
Helene's 
box,
the 
door 
opened, 
and 
Anatole 
entered, 
stooping 
and 
trying 
not 
to 
brush
against 
anyone.

"Let 
me 
introduce 
my 
brother 
to 
you," 
said 
Helene, 
her 
eyes
shifting<p>
uneasily 
from 
Natasha 
to 
Anatole.

Natasha 
turned 
her 
pretty 
little 
head 
toward 
the 
elegant 
young 
officer
and 
smiled 
at 
him 
over 
her 
bare 
shoulder. 
Anatole, 
who 
was 
as 
handsome
at 
close 
quarters 
as 
at 
a 
distance, 
sat<p>
down 
beside 
her 
and 
told 
her 
he
had 
long 
wished 
to 
have 
this 
happiness-ever 
since 
the 
Naryshkins'
ball 
in 
fact, 
at 
which 
he 
had 
had 
the 
well-remembered 
pleasure 
of 
seeing
her. 
Kuragin 
was 
much 
more 
sensible 
and 
simple 
with 
women 
than 
among
men. 
He 
talked 
boldly 
and 
naturally, 
and 
Natasha 
was 
strangely 
and
agreeably 
struck 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
formidable 
in 
this
man 
about 
whom 
there 
was 
so 
much 
talk, 
but 
that 
on 
the 
contrary 
his
smile 
was 
most 
naive, 
cheerful, 
and 
good-natured.

Kuragin 
asked 
her 
opinion 
of 
the 
performance 
and 
told 
her 
how 
at 
a
previous 
performance 
Semenova 
had 
fallen 
down 
on 
the 
stage.

"And 
do 
you 
know, 
Countess," 
he 
said, 
suddenly 
addressing 
her 
as 
an
old, 
familiar 
acquaintance, 
"we 
are 
getting 
up 
a 
costume 
tournament;
you 
ought 
to 
take 
part 
in 
it! 
It 
will 
be 
great 
fun. 
We 
shall 
all 
meet 
at
the 
Karagins'! 
Please 
come! 
No! 
Really, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">eh?"</a> 
said 
he.

While 
saying 
this 
he 
never 
removed 
his 
smiling 
eyes 
from 
her 
face,
her 
neck, 
and 
her 
bare 
arms. 
Natasha 
knew 
for 
certain 
that 
he 
was
enraptured 
by 
her. 
This 
pleased 
her, 
yet 
his 
presence 
made 
her 
feel
constrained 
and 
oppressed. 
When 
she 
was 
not 
looking 
at 
him 
she 
felt 
that
he 
was 
looking 
at 
her 
shoulders, 
and 
she 
involuntarily 
caught 
his 
eye
so

said 
Timokhin 
timidly, 
and 
continually 
turning 
to 
glance 
at
his 
colonel.

"Why 
so?" 
asked 
Pierre.

"Well, 
to 
mention 
only 
firewood 
and 
fodder, 
let 
me 
inform 
you. 
Why,<p>
when
we 
were 
retreating 
from 
Sventsyani 
we 
dare 
not 
touch 
a 
stick 
or 
a 
wisp
of 
hay 
or 
anything. 
You 
see, 
we 
were

wasn't 
it 
so, 
your

and 
again 
Timokhin 
turned 
to 
the 
prince.
"But 
we 
daren't. 
In 
our 
regiment 
two 
officers 
were 
court-martialed 
for
that 
kind 
of 
thing. 
But 
when 
his 
Serenity 
took<p>
command 
everything 
became
straightforward. 
Now 
we 
see 
light...."

"Then 
why 
was 
it 
forbidden?"

Timokhin 
looked 
about 
in 
confusion, 
not 
knowing 
what 
or 
how 
to 
answer
such 
a 
question. 
Pierre 
put 
the 
same<p>
question 
to 
Prince 
Andrew.

"Why, 
so 
as 
not 
to 
lay 
waste 
the 
country 
we 
were 
abandoning 
to 
the
enemy," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
venomous 
irony. 
"It 
is 
very 
sound:
one 
can't 
permit 
the 
land 
to 
be 
pillaged 
and 
accustom 
the 
troops 
to
marauding. 
At 
Smolensk 
too 
he 
judged 
correctly 
that 
the 
French 
might
outflank 
us, 
as 
they 
had 
larger 
forces. 
But 
he 
could 
not 
understand
this," 
cried 
Prince 
Andrew 
in 
a 
shrill 
voice 
that 
seemed 
to 
escape 
him
involuntarily: 
"he 
could 
not 
understand 
that 
there, 
for 
the 
first 
time,
we 
were 
fighting 
for 
Russian 
soil, 
and 
that 
there 
was 
a 
spirit 
in 
the
men 
such 
as 
I 
had 
never 
seen 
before, 
that 
we<p>
had 
held 
the 
French 
for
two 
days, 
and 
that 
that 
success 
had 
increased 
our 
strength 
tenfold. 
He
ordered<p>
us 
to 
retreat, 
and 
all 
our 
efforts 
and 
losses 
went 
for 
nothing.
He 
had 
no 
thought 
of 
betraying 
us, 
he 
tried 
to 
do 
the 
best 
he 
could,
he 
thought 
out 
everything, 
and 
that 
is 
why 
he 
is 
unsuitable. 
He 
is
unsuitable 
now, 
just 
because 
he 
plans 
out 
everything 
very 
thoroughly 
and
accurately 
as 
every 
German 
has 
to. 
How 
can 
I 
explain?... 
Well, 
say 
your
father 
has 
a 
German 
valet, 
and 
he 
is 
a 
splendid 
valet 
and 
satisfies 
your
father's 
requirements 
better 
than 
you 
could, 
then 
it's 
all 
right 
to 
let
him 
serve. 
But 
if 
your 
father 
is 
mortally 
sick 
you'll 
send 
the 
valet
away 
and 
attend 
to 
your 
father 
with 
your 
own 
unpracticed, 
awkward 
hands,
and 
will 
soothe 
him 
better 
than 
a 
skilled 
man 
who 
is 
a 
stranger 
could.
So 
it 
has 
been 
with 
Barclay. 
While 
Russia 
was 
well, 
a 
foreigner 
could
serve 
her 
and 
be 
a 
splendid 
minister; 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
she 
is 
in 
danger
she 
needs 
one 
of 
her 
own 
kin. 
But 
in 
your 
Club 
they 
have 
been 
making 
him
out 
a 
traitor! 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZUI6tQp05Akk.html">They</a> 
slander 
him 
as 
a 
traitor, 
and 
the 
only 
result 
will
be 
that 
afterwards, 
ashamed 
of 
their 
false 
accusations, 
they 
will 
make
him 
out 
a 
hero 
or 
a 
genius 
instead 
of 
a 
traitor, 
and 
that 
will 
be 
still
more 
unjust. 
He 
is 
an 
honest 
and 
very 
punctilious 
German."

"And 
they 
say 
he's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mRO4NbF2f5As.html">a</a>

commander," 
rejoined 
Pierre.

"I 
don't 
understand 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
'a 
skillful 
commander,'" 
replied
Prince 
Andrew 
ironically.

"A 
skillful 
commander?" 
replied 
Pierre. 
"Why, 
one 
who 
foresees 
all
contingencies... 
and 
foresees 
the 
adversary's 
intentions."

"But 
that's 
impossible," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
matter
settled 
long 
ago.

Pierre 
looked 
at 
him<p>
in 
surprise.

"And

Pierre 
saw 
that</h1>Prince 
Andrew 
was 
going 
to 
speak<p>
of 
Natasha, 
and 
his
broad 
face 
expressed 
pity 
and 
sympathy. 
This 
<a href="/cZl/uz8pVEYz1EwE4W.html">expression</a> 
irritated 
Prince
Andrew, 
and 
in 
a 
determined, 
ringing, 
and 
unpleasant 
tone 
he 
continued:

"I 
have 
received 
a 
refusal 
from 
Countess 
Rostova 
and 
have 
heard 
reports
of 
your 
brother-in-law 
having 
sought 
her 
hand, 
or 
something 
of 
that
kind. 
Is 
that 
true?"

"Both 
true 
and 
untrue," 
Pierre 
began; 
but 
Prince 
Andrew 
interrupted 
him.

"Here 
are 
her 
letters 
and 
her 
portrait," 
said 
he.

He 
took 
the 
packet 
from 
the 
table 
and 
handed 
it 
to 
Pierre.

"Give 
this 
to 
the 
countess... 
if 
you 
see 
her."

"She 
is 
very 
ill," 
said 
Pierre.

"Then 
she 
is 
here 
still?" 
said 
Prince 
<a href="/aVzUge/YE7mbEd9f4tHLaX.html">Andrew.</a> 
"And 
Prince 
Kuragin?" 
he
added 
quickly.

"He 
<a href="/aVzUge/EY78hoZsa0.html">left</a> 
long 
ago. 
She 
has 
been 
at 
death's 
door."

"I 
much 
regret 
her 
illness," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew; 
and 
he 
smiled 
like 
his
father, 
coldly, 
maliciously, 
and 
unpleasantly.

"So 
Monsieur 
Kuragin 
has 
not 
honored 
Countess 
Rostova 
with 
his 
hand?"
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and 
he 
snorted 
several 
times.

"He 
could 
not 
marry, 
for 
he 
was 
married 
already," 
said 
Pierre.

Prince 
Andrew 
<a href="/aVzUge/AaD9zr76NFutM.html">laughed</a> 
disagreeably, 
again 
reminding 
one 
of 
his 
father.

"And 
where 
is 
your 
brother-in-law 
now, 
if 
I 
may 
ask?" 
he 
said.

"He 
has 
gone 
to 
Peters... 
But 
I 
don't 
know," 
said 
Pierre.

"Well, 
it 
doesn't 
matter," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"Tell 
Countess 
Rostova
that 
she 
was 
and 
is 
perfectly 
free 
and 
that 
I 
wish 
her 
all 
that 
is
good."

Pierre 
took 
the 
packet. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
as 
if 
trying 
to 
remember 
whether
he 
had 
something 
more 
to 
say, 
or 
waiting 
to 
see 
if 
Pierre 
would 
say
anything, 
looked 
fixedly 
at 
him.

"I 
say, 
do 
you 
remember 
our 
discussion 
in 
Petersburg?" 
asked 
Pierre,
"about..."

"Yes," 
returned 
Prince 
Andrew 
hastily. 
"I 
said 
that 
a 
fallen 
woman
should 
be 
forgiven, 
but 
I 
didn't 
say 
I 
could 
forgive 
her. 
I 
can't."

"But 
can 
this 
be 
compared...?" 
said 
Pierre.

Prince 
Andrew 
interrupted 
him 
and 
cried 
sharply: 
"Yes, 
ask 
her 
hand
again, 
be 
magnanimous, 
and 
so 
on?... 
Yes, 
that 
would 
be 
very 
noble, 
but
I 
am 
unable 
to 
follow 
in 
that 
gentleman's 
footsteps. 
If 
you 
wish 
to 
be
my 
friend 
never 
speak 
to 
me 
of 
that... 
of 
all 
that! 
Well, 
good-by. 
So
you'll 
give 
her 
the 
packet?"

Pierre 
left 
the 
room 
and 
went 
to 
the 
old 
prince 
and 
Princess 
Mary.

The 
old 
man 
seemed 
livelier 
than 
usual. 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
the 
same 
as
always, 
but 
beneath 
her 
sympathy 
for 
her 
brother, 
Pierre 
noticed 
her
satisfaction 
that 
the 
engagement 
had 
been 
broken 
off. 
Looking 
at 
them
Pierre 
realized 
what 
contempt 
and 
animosity 
they 
all 
felt 
for 
the
Rostovs, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
in 
their 
presence 
even 
to 
mention
the 
name 
of 
her 
who 
could 
give 
up 
Prince 
Andrew 
for 
<a href="/nocrawl/aVzUge/IDs5SDFV3ikR7vhjV.html">anyone</a> 
else.

At 
dinner 
the 
talk 
turned 
on 
the 
war, 
the 
approach 
of 
which 
was 
becoming
evident. 
Prince 
Andrew 
talked 
incessantly, 
arguing 
now 
with 
his 
father,
now 
with 
the 
Swiss 
tutor 
Dessalles, 
and 
showing 
an 
unnatural 
animation,
the 
cause 
of 
which 
Pierre 
so 
well<p>
understood.





CHAPTER 
XXII

That 
same 
evening 
Pierre 
went 
to 
the 
Rostovs' 
to 
fulfill 
the 
commission
entrusted 
to 
him. 
Natasha 
was 
in 
bed, 
the 
count 
at 
the 
club, 
and 
Pierre,
after 
giving 
the 
letters 
to 
Sonya, 
went 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
who 
was
interested 
to 
know 
how 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
taken 
the 
news. 
Ten 
minutes
later 
Sonya 
came 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna.

"Natasha 
insists 
on 
seeing 
Count 
Peter 
Kirilovich," 
said 
she.

"But 
how? 
Are 
we 
to 
take 
him 
up 
to 
her? 
The 
room 
there 
has 
not 
been
tidied 
up."

"No, 
she 
has 
dressed 
and 
gone 
into 
the 
drawing 
room," 
said 
Sonya.

Marya 
Dmitrievna 
only 
shrugged 
her 
shoulders.

"When 
will 
her 
mother 
come? 
She 
has 
worried 
me 
to 
death! 
Now 
mind, 
don't
tell 
her 
everything!" 
said 
she 
to 
Pierre. 
"One 
hasn't 
the 
heart 
to 
scold
her, 
she 
is 
so 
much 
to 
be 
pitied, 
so 
much 
to 
be 
pitied."

"Bind

"I

shouted 
the

pushing
away

from

he
flung 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/HB95NtgpO1Xs.html">it</a> 
on

As 
if 
this 
action 
had 
some 
mysterious 
and 
menacing 
significance, 
the
workmen 
surrounding 
the 
publican 
paused 
in 
indecision.

"I 
know 
the

very 
well,

I'll 
take

shouted 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/tm7XT3R.html">publican,</a><p>
picking 
up 
his 
cap.

"Come 
along

Come 
along 
then!" 
the 
publican 
and 
the 
tall 
young
fellow 
repeated 
one 
after 
the 
other, 
and 
they 
moved 
up 
the 
street
together.

The 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ew6HAJD7Nqwe1.html">bloodstained</a> 
smith 
went 
beside 
them. 
The 
factory 
hands 
and 
others
followed 
behind, 
talking 
and 
shouting.

At 
the 
corner 
of 
the 
Moroseyka, 
opposite 
a 
large 
house 
with 
closed
shutters 
and 
bearing 
a 
bootmaker's 
signboard, 
stood<p>
a 
score 
of 
thin,
worn-out, 
gloomy-faced 
bootmakers, 
wearing 
overalls 
and 
long 
tattered
coats.

"He 
should 
pay 
folks 
off 
properly," 
a 
thin 
workingman, 
with 
frowning
brows 
and 
a 
straggly 
beard, 
was 
saying.

"But 
he's 
sucked 
our 
blood 
and 
now 
he 
thinks 
he's 
quit 
of 
us. 
He's

all 
the 
week 
and 
now 
that 
he's

us

he's

On 
seeing 
the 
crowd 
and 
the 
bloodstained 
man 
the 
workman 
ceased
speaking, 
and 
with 
eager 
curiosity 
all 
the 
bootmakers 
joined 
the 
moving
crowd.

"Where 
are 
all 
the 
folks 
going?"

"Why, 
to 
the 
police, 
of

"I 
say,

it

that 
we 
have 
been 
beaten?" 
"And 
what 
did 
you 
think?
Look 
what 
folks 
are 
saying."

Questions 
and 
answers 
were 
heard. 
The 
publican, 
taking 
advantage 
of 
the
increased 
crowd, 
dropped 
behind 
and 
returned 
to 
his 
tavern.

The 
tall 
youth, 
not 
noticing 
the 
disappearance 
of 
his 
foe, 
waved 
his
bare 
arm 
and 
went 
on 
talking 
incessantly, 
attracting 
general 
attention
to 
himself. 
It 
was 
around 
him 
that 
the 
people 
chiefly<p>
crowded, 
expecting
answers 
from 
him 
to 
the 
questions 
that 
occupied 
all 
their 
minds.

"He 
must 
keep

what

Am

said 
the 
tall 
youth, 
with 
a
scarcely 
perceptible 
smile. 
"He 
thinks 
there's 
no

How 
can

do 
without

Or 
else 
there 
would

"Why</a>

voices 
in

"Will

morning 
had 
been

on 
ensuring 
that 
they
all-she 
herself, 
Mamma, 
and 
Sonya-should 
be 
as 
well 
dressed 
as
possible. 
Sonya 
and 
her 
mother 
put 
themselves 
entirely 
in 
her 
hands.
The 
countess 
was 
to 
wear 
a 
claret-colored 
velvet 
dress, 
and 
the 
two
girls 
white 
gauze 
over 
pink 
silk 
slips, 
with 
roses 
on 
their 
bodices 
and
their 
hair 
dressed 
a 
la 
grecque.

Everything 
essential 
had 
already 
been 
done; 
feet, 
hands, 
necks, 
and
ears 
washed, 
perfumed, 
and 
powdered, 
as 
befits 
a 
ball; 
the 
openwork
silk 
stockings 
and 
white 
satin 
shoes 
with 
ribbons 
were 
already 
on; 
the
hairdressing 
was 
almost 
done. 
Sonya 
was 
finishing 
dressing 
and 
so 
was
the 
countess, 
but 
Natasha, 
who 
had 
bustled 
about 
helping 
them 
all, 
was
behindhand. 
She 
was 
still 
sitting 
before 
a 
looking-glass 
with 
a 
dressing
jacket 
thrown 
over 
her 
slender 
shoulders. 
Sonya 
stood 
ready 
dressed 
in
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
and, 
pressing 
the 
head 
of 
a 
pin 
till 
it 
hurt 
her
dainty 
finger, 
was 
fixing 
on 
a 
last 
ribbon 
that 
squeaked 
as 
the 
pin 
went
through 
it.

"That's 
not 
the 
way, 
that's 
not 
the 
way, 
Sonya!" 
cried 
Natasha
turning 
her 
head 
and 
clutching 
with 
both 
hands 
at 
her 
hair 
which 
the
maid 
who<p>
was 
dressing 
it 
had 
not 
time 
to 
release. 
"That 
bow 
is 
not
right. 
Come 
here!"

Sonya 
sat 
down 
and 
Natasha 
pinned 
the 
ribbon 
on 
differently.

"Allow 
me, 
Miss!<p>
I 
can't 
do 
it 
like 
that," 
said 
the 
maid 
who 
was
holding 
Natasha's 
hair.

"Oh, 
dear! 
Well 
then, 
wait. 
That's 
right, 
Sonya."

"Aren't 
you 
ready? 
It 
is 
nearly 
ten," 
came 
the 
countess' 
voice.

"Directly! 
Directly! 
And 
you,<p>
Mamma?"

"I 
have 
only 
my 
cap 
to 
pin 
on."

"Don't 
do 
it 
without 
me!" 
called 
Natasha. 
"You 
won't 
do 
it
right."

"But 
it's 
already 
ten."

They 
had 
decided 
to 
be 
at 
the 
ball 
by 
half-past 
ten, 
and 
Natasha 
had
still 
to 
get 
dressed 
and 
they 
had 
to 
call 
at 
the 
Taurida 
Gardens.

When 
her 
hair 
was 
done, 
Natasha, 
in 
her 
short 
petticoat 
from 
under
which 
her 
dancing 
shoes 
showed, 
and 
in 
her 
mother's 
dressing 
jacket,
ran 
<a href="/cZl/IN44oFuln0UGRY.html">up</a> 
to 
Sonya, 
scrutinized 
her, 
and 
then 
ran 
to 
her 
mother. 
Turning
her 
mother's 
head 
this 
way 
and 
that, 
she 
fastened 
on 
the 
cap 
and,
hurriedly 
kissing 
her 
gray 
hair, 
ran 
back 
to 
the 
maids 
who 
were 
turning
up 
the 
hem 
of 
her 
skirt.

The 
cause 
of 
the 
delay 
was 
Natasha's 
skirt, 
which 
was 
too 
long.
Two 
maids 
were 
turning 
up 
the 
hem 
and 
hurriedly 
biting 
off 
the 
ends 
of
thread. 
A<p>
third 
with 
pins 
in 
her 
mouth 
was 
running 
about 
between 
the
countess 
and 
Sonya, 
and 
a 
fourth 
held 
the 
whole 
of<p>
the 
gossamer 
garment
up 
high 
on 
one 
uplifted 
hand.

"Mavra, 
quicker, 
darling!"

"Give 
me 
my 
thimble, 
Miss, 
from 
there..."

"Whenever 
will 
you 
be 
ready?" 
asked 
the 
count 
coming 
to 
the<p>
door.
"Here 
is 
some 
scent. 
Peronskaya 
must 
be 
tired 
of 
waiting."

"It's 
ready, 
Miss," 
said 
the 
maid, 
holding 
up 
the 
shortened 
gauze
dress 
with 
two 
fingers,<p>
and 
blowing 
and 
shaking 
something 
off 
it, 
as 
if
by 
this 
to 
express 
a 
consciousness 
of 
the 
airiness 
and 
purity 
of 
what
she 
held.

Natasha 
began 
putting 
on 
the 
dress.

"In 
a 
minute! 
In 
a 
minute! 
Don't 
come 
in, 
Papa!" 
she 
cried 
to 
her
father 
as 
he<p>
opened 
the 
door-speaking 
from 
under 
the 
filmy 
skirt 
which
still 
covered 
her 
whole 
face.

Sonya 
slammed 
the 
door 
to. 
A 
minute 
later 
they 
let 
the 
count 
in. 
He 
was
wearing 
a 
blue 
swallow-tail 
coat, 
shoes 
and 
stockings, 
and 
was 
perfumed
and 
his 
hair 
pomaded.

"Oh, 
Papa! 
how 
nice 
you 
look! 
Charming!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
as 
she
stood 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
smoothing 
out 
the 
folds 
of 
the 
gauze.

"If 
you 
please, 
Miss! 
allow 
me," 
said 
the 
maid, 
who 
on 
her 
knees 
was
pulling 
the 
skirt 
straight 
and 
shifting 
the 
pins 
from 
one 
side 
of 
her
mouth 
to 
the 
other 
<a href="/aVzUge/Dt5rq4kplH7ioN.html">with</a> 
her 
tongue.

"Say 
what 
you 
like," 
exclaimed 
Sonya, 
in 
a 
despairing 
voice 
as 
she
looked 
at 
Natasha, 
"say 
what 
you 
like, 
it's 
still 
too 
long."

Natasha

back

herself

fog, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Cc3mGGRm7qQqw5.html">there</a> 
was 
a 
flash, 
followed 
by 
a 
report,
and 
a 
bullet 
whizzing 
high 
up 
in 
the 
mist 
with 
a 
plaintive 
sound 
passed
out 
of 
hearing. 
Another 
musket 
missed 
fire 
but 
flashed 
in 
the 
pan.
Rostov 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
back. 
Four 
more 
reports 
followed
at 
intervals, 
and 
the 
bullets 
passed 
somewhere 
in 
the 
fog 
singing 
in
different 
tones. 
Rostov 
reined 
in 
his 
horse, 
whose 
spirits 
had 
risen,
like 
his 
own, 
at 
the 
firing, 
and 
went 
back 
at 
a 
footpace. 
"Well, 
some
more! 
Some 
more!" 
a 
merry 
voice 
was 
saying 
in 
his 
soul. 
But 
no 
more
shots 
came.

Only 
when 
approaching 
Bagration 
did 
Rostov 
let 
his 
horse 
gallop 
again,
and 
with 
his 
hand 
at 
the 
salute 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
general.

Dolgorukov 
was 
still 
insisting 
that 
the 
French 
had 
retreated 
and 
had
only 
lit 
fires 
to 
deceive 
us.

"What 
does 
that 
prove?" 
he 
was 
saying 
as 
Rostov 
rode 
up. 
"They
might 
retreat 
and 
leave 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Wb49N5l.html">the</a> 
<a href="/cZl/Ig7yf7Ptam5q.html">pickets."

"It's</a> 
plain 
that 
they 
have 
not 
all 
gone 
yet, 
Prince," 
said
Bagration. 
"Wait 
till 
tomorrow 
morning, 
we'll 
find 
out 
everything
tomorrow."

"The 
picket 
is<p>
still 
on 
the 
hill, 
your 
excellency, 
just 
where 
it 
was
in 
the 
evening," 
reported 
Rostov, 
stooping 
forward 
with 
his 
hand 
at
the 
salute 
and 
unable 
to 
repress 
the 
smile 
of 
delight 
induced 
by 
his
ride 
and 
especially 
by 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
bullets.

"Very 
good, 
very 
good," 
said 
Bagration. 
"Thank 
you, 
officer."

"Your 
excellency," 
said 
Rostov, 
"may 
I 
ask 
a 
favor?"

"What 
is 
it?"

"Tomorrow 
our 
squadron 
is 
to 
be 
in 
reserve. 
May 
I 
ask 
to 
be 
attached
to 
the 
first 
squadron?"

"What's 
your 
name?"

"Count 
Rostov."

"Oh, 
very 
well, 
you 
may 
stay 
in 
attendance 
on 
me."

"Count 
Ilya 
Rostov's 
son?" 
asked 
Dolgorukov.

But 
Rostov 
did 
not 
reply.

"Then 
I 
may 
reckon 
on 
it, 
your 
excellency?"

"I 
will 
give 
the 
order."

"Tomorrow 
very 
likely 
I 
may 
be 
sent 
with 
<a href="/cZl/io9bKMVG1gcFtr4IEXzL.html">some</a> 
message 
to 
the
Emperor," 
thought 
Rostov.

"Thank 
God!"

The 
fires 
and 
shouting 
in 
the 
enemy's 
army 
were 
occasioned 
by 
the 
fact
that 
while 
Napoleon's 
proclamation 
was 
being 
read 
to 
the 
troops 
the
Emperor 
himself 
rode 
round 
his 
bivouacs. 
The 
soldiers, 
on 
seeing 
him,
lit 
wisps 
of 
straw 
and 
ran 
after 
him, 
shouting, 
"Vive 
l'Empereur!"
Napoleon's 
proclamation 
was 
as 
follows:

Soldiers! 
The 
Russian 
army 
is 
advancing 
against 
you 
to 
avenge 
the
Austrian<p>
army 
of 
Ulm.<p>
They 
are 
the 
same 
battalions 
you 
broke 
at
Hollabruenn 
and 
have 
pursued 
ever 
since 
to 
this

The 
position 
we
occupy 
is 
a 
strong 
one, 
and 
while 
they 
are 
marching 
to 
go 
round 
me 
on
the 
right 
they 
will 
expose 
a 
flank 
to 
me. 
Soldiers! 
I 
will 
myself 
direct
your 
battalions. 
I 
will 
keep 
out 
of 
fire 
if 
you 
with 
your 
habitual
valor 
carry 
disorder 
and 
confusion 
into 
the 
enemy's 
ranks, 
but 
should
victory 
be 
in 
doubt, 
even 
for 
a 
moment, 
you 
will 
see 
your 
Emperor
exposing 
himself 
to 
the 
first 
blows 
of 
the 
enemy, 
for 
there 
must 
be 
no
doubt 
of 
victory, 
especially 
on 
this 
day<p>
when 
what 
is 
at 
stake 
is 
the
honor 
of 
the 
French 
infantry, 
so 
necessary 
<a href="/aVzUge/oWJ8tc62Jn.html">to</a> 
the 
honor 
of 
our

Do 
not

This 
reading,
as 
was 
always 
the 
case 
at 
Anna 
Pavlovna's 
soirees, 
had 
a 
political
significance. 
That 
evening 
she 
expected 
several 
important 
personages 
who
had 
to 
be 
made 
ashamed 
of 
their 
visits 
to 
the 
French 
theater 
and 
aroused
to 
a 
patriotic 
temper. 
A 
good 
many 
people 
had 
already 
arrived, 
but 
Anna
Pavlovna,<p>
not 
yet 
seeing 
all 
those 
whom 
she 
wanted 
in 
her 
drawing 
room,
did 
not 
let 
the 
reading 
begin 
but 
wound 
up 
the 
springs 
of 
a 
general
conversation.

The 
news 
of 
the 
day 
in 
Petersburg 
was 
the 
illness 
of 
Countess 
Bezukhova.
She 
had 
fallen 
ill 
unexpectedly 
a 
few 
days 
previously, 
had 
missed
several 
gatherings 
of 
which 
she 
was 
usually 
the 
ornament, 
and 
was 
said
to 
be 
receiving 
no 
one, 
and 
instead 
of 
the 
celebrated 
Petersburg 
doctors
who 
usually 
attended 
her 
had 
entrusted 
herself 
to 
some<p>
Italian 
doctor
who 
was 
treating 
her 
in 
some 
new 
and 
unusual 
way.

They 
all 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
the 
enchanting 
countess' 
illness 
arose 
from
an 
inconvenience 
resulting 
from 
marrying 
two 
husbands 
at 
the 
same 
time,
and 
that 
the 
Italian's 
cure 
consisted 
in 
removing 
such 
inconvenience;
but 
in 
Anna 
Pavlovna's 
presence 
no 
one 
dared 
to 
think 
of 
this 
or 
even
appear 
to 
know 
it.

"They 
say 
the 
poor 
countess 
is 
very 
ill. 
The 
doctor 
says 
it 
is 
angina
pectoris."

"Angina? 
Oh, 
that's 
a 
terrible 
illness!"

"They 
say 
that 
the 
rivals 
are 
reconciled, 
thanks 
to 
the 
angina..." 
and
the 
word 
angina 
was 
repeated 
with 
great 
satisfaction.

"The 
count 
is 
pathetic, 
they 
say. 
He 
cried 
like 
a 
child 
when 
the 
doctor
told 
him 
the 
case 
was 
dangerous."

"Oh, 
it 
would 
be<p>
a 
terrible 
loss, 
she 
is 
an 
enchanting 
woman."

"You 
are 
speaking 
of 
the 
poor 
countess?" 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
coming
up 
just 
then. 
"I 
sent 
to 
ask 
for 
news, 
and 
hear 
that 
she 
is 
a 
little
better. 
Oh, 
she 
is 
certainly 
the 
most 
charming 
woman 
in 
the 
world," 
she
went 
on, 
with 
a 
smile 
at 
her 
own 
enthusiasm. 
"We 
belong 
to 
different
camps, 
but 
that 
does 
not 
prevent 
my 
esteeming 
her 
as 
she 
deserves. 
She
is 
very 
unfortunate!" 
added 
Anna 
Pavlovna.

Supposing 
that 
by 
these 
words 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
was 
somewhat 
lifting 
the
veil 
from 
the 
secret 
of 
the 
countess' 
malady,<p>
an 
unwary 
young 
man
ventured 
to 
express 
surprise 
that 
well-known 
doctors 
had 
not 
been 
called
in 
and 
that 
the 
countess 
was 
being 
attended 
by 
a 
charlatan 
who 
might
employ 
dangerous 
remedies.

"Your 
information 
may 
be 
better 
than 
mine," 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
suddenly 
and
venomously 
retorted 
on 
the 
inexperienced 
young 
man, 
"but 
I 
know 
on 
good
authority 
that 
this 
doctor 
is 
a 
very 
learned 
and 
able 
man. 
He 
is 
private
physician 
to 
the 
Queen 
of 
Spain."

And 
having 
thus 
demolished 
the 
young 
man, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
turned 
to
another 
group 
where 
Bilibin 
was 
talking 
about 
the 
Austrians: 
having
wrinkled 
up 
his 
face 
he 
was 
evidently 
preparing 
to<p>
smooth 
it 
out 
again
and 
utter 
one 
of 
his 
mots.

"I 
think 
it 
is 
delightful," 
he 
said, 
referring 
to 
a 
diplomatic 
note 
that

CHAPTER 
X

Natasha 
had 
married 
in 
the 
early 
spring 
of 
1813, 
and 
in 
1820 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UZ7GaVr7XZEHJ3bzE.html">already</a> 
had
three 
daughters 
besides 
a 
son 
for 
whom 
she 
had 
longed 
and 
whom 
she 
was
now 
nursing. 
She 
had 
grown 
stouter 
and 
broader, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
difficult
to 
recognize 
in 
this 
robust, 
motherly 
woman 
the 
slim, 
lively 
Natasha 
of
former 
days. 
Her 
features 
were 
more 
defined 
and 
had 
a 
calm, 
soft,
and 
serene 
expression. 
In 
her 
face 
there 
was 
none<p>
of 
the 
ever-glowing
animation 
that 
had 
formerly 
burned 
there 
and 
constituted 
its 
charm.
Now 
her 
face 
and 
body 
were 
often 
all 
that 
one 
saw, 
and 
her 
soul 
was
not 
visible 
at 
all. 
All 
that 
struck 
the 
eye 
was 
a 
strong, 
handsome, 
and
fertile 
woman. 
The 
old 
fire 
very 
rarely 
kindled 
in 
her 
face 
now. 
That
happened 
only 
when, 
as 
was 
the 
case 
that 
day, 
her 
husband 
returned 
home,
or 
a 
sick 
child 
was 
<a href="/cZl/jRO3YXnB5A5mDKi.html">convalescent,</a> 
or 
when 
she 
and 
Countess 
Mary 
spoke 
of
Prince 
Andrew 
(she 
never 
mentioned 
him 
to 
her 
husband, 
who 
she 
imagined
was 
jealous 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
memory), 
<a href="/aVzUge/fF3Gbiq6WMNlO3L.html">or</a> 
on 
the 
rare 
occasions 
when
something 
happened 
to 
induce 
her 
to 
sing, 
a 
practice 
she 
had 
quite
abandoned 
since 
her 
marriage. 
At 
the 
rare 
moments 
when 
the 
old 
fire
did 
kindle 
in 
her 
handsome, 
fully 
developed 
body 
she 
was 
even 
more
attractive 
than 
in 
former 
days.

Since 
their 
marriage 
Natasha 
and 
her 
husband 
had 
lived 
in<p>
Moscow, 
in
Petersburg, 
on 
their 
estate 
near 
Moscow, 
or 
with 
her 
mother, 
that 
is 
to
say, 
in 
Nicholas' 
house. 
The 
young 
Countess 
Bezukhova 
was 
not 
often 
seen
in 
society, 
and 
those 
who 
met 
her 
there 
were 
not 
pleased 
with 
her
and 
found 
her 
neither 
attractive 
nor 
amiable. 
Not 
that 
Natasha 
liked
solitude-she 
did 
not 
know 
whether 
she 
liked 
it 
or 
not, 
she 
even 
thought
that 
she 
did 
not-but 
with 
her 
pregnancies, 
her 
confinements, 
the 
nursing
of 
her 
children, 
and 
sharing 
every 
moment 
of 
her 
husband's 
life, 
she 
had

Natasha 
kept 
looking
uneasily 
at 
everybody 
with 
wide-open 
eyes, 
as 
if<p>
wishing 
to 
intercept
every 
glance 
directed 
toward 
her, 
and 
tried 
to 
appear 
the 
same 
as 
usual.

After 
breakfast, 
which 
was 
her 
best 
time, 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
sat 
down 
in
her 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/MjR5A9Fmd9tTlW.html">armchair</a> 
and 
called 
Natasha 
and 
the 
count 
to 
her.

"Well, 
friends, 
I 
have 
now 
thought 
the 
whole 
matter 
over 
and 
this 
is
my 
advice," 
she 
began. 
"Yesterday, 
as 
you 
know,<p>
<a href="/aVzUge/zr2GLq9s.html">I</a> 
went 
to 
see 
Prince
Bolkonski. 
Well, 
I 
had 
a 
talk 
with 
him.... 
He 
took 
it 
into 
his 
head 
to
begin 
shouting, 
but 
I 
am 
not 
one 
to 
be 
shouted 
down. 
I 
said 
what 
I 
had
to 
say!"

"Well, 
and 
he?" 
asked 
the 
count.

"He? 
He's 
crazy... 
he 
did 
not 
want 
to 
listen. 
But 
what's 
the 
use
of 
talking? 
As 
it 
is 
we 
have 
<a href="/cZl/xt2OfLLj2l2l.html">worn</a> 
the 
poor<p>
girl 
out," 
said 
Marya
Dmitrievna. 
"My 
advice 
to 
you 
is 
finish 
your 
business 
and 
go 
back
home 
to 
Otradnoe... 
and 
wait 
there."

"Oh, 
no!" 
exclaimed 
Natasha.

"Yes, 
go 
back," 
said 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
"and 
wait 
there. 
If<p>
your
betrothed 
comes 
here 
now-there 
will 
be 
no 
avoiding 
a 
quarrel; 
but
alone 
with 
the 
old 
man 
he 
will 
talk 
things 
over 
and 
then 
come 
on 
to
you."

Count 
Rostov 
approved 
of 
this 
suggestion, 
appreciating 
its
reasonableness. 
If 
the 
old 
man 
came 
round 
it 
would 
be 
all 
the 
better 
to
visit 
him 
in 
Moscow 
or 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
later 
on; 
and 
if 
not, 
the 
wedding,
against 
his 
wishes, 
could 
only 
be 
arranged 
at 
Otradnoe.

"That 
is 
perfectly 
true. 
And 
I 
am 
sorry 
I 
went 
to 
see 
him 
and 
took
her," 
said 
the 
old 
count.

"No, 
why 
be 
sorry? 
Being 
here, 
you 
had 
to 
pay 
your 
respects. 
But 
if 
he
won't-that's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ks6HPeSU4O0qQI.html">his</a> 
affair," 
said 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
looking 
for
something 
in 
her 
reticule. 
"Besides, 
the 
trousseau 
is 
ready, 
so 
there
is 
nothing 
to 
wait 
for; 
and 
what 
is 
not 
ready 
I'll 
send 
after 
you.
Though 
I 
don't 
like 
letting 
you 
go, 
it 
is 
the 
best 
way. 
So 
go, 
with
God's 
blessing!"

Having 
found 
what 
she 
was 
looking 
for 
in 
the 
reticule 
she 
handed 
it 
to
Natasha.

With

Moscow

A

the

issued:


INHABITANTS 
OF 
MOSCOW!

Your 
misfortunes 
are 
cruel, 
but 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
and 
King
desires 
to 
arrest 
their 
course. 
Terrible 
examples 
have 
taught 
you 
how 
he
punishes 
disobedience 
and 
crime. 
Strict 
measures 
have 
been 
taken 
to
put 
an 
end 
to 
disorder 
and 
to 
re-establish 
public 
security. 
A
paternal 
administration, 
chosen 
from 
among 
yourselves, 
will 
form 
your
municipality 
or 
city 
government. 
It 
will 
take 
care 
of 
you, 
of 
your
needs, 
and 
of 
your 
welfare. 
Its 
members 
will 
be 
distinguished 
by 
a 
red
ribbon 
worn 
across 
the 
shoulder,

the 
mayor

Several

Whether 
it 
was 
the
teacher's 
fault 
or 
the 
pupil's, 
this 
same 
thing 
happened 
every 
day:
the 
princess' 
eyes 
grew 
dim, 
she 
could 
not 
see 
and 
could 
not 
hear
anything, 
but 
was 
only 
<a href="/cZl/hK9It2AJH8Ztx.html">conscious</a> 
of 
her<p>
stern 
father's 
withered 
face
close 
to 
her, 
of 
his 
breath 
and 
the 
smell 
of 
him, 
and 
could 
think 
only
of 
how 
to 
get 
away 
quickly 
to 
her 
own 
room 
to 
make 
out 
the 
problem 
in
peace. 
The 
old 
man 
was 
beside 
himself: 
moved 
the 
chair 
on 
which 
he 
was
sitting 
noisily 
backward 
and 
forward, 
made 
efforts 
to 
control 
himself
and 
not 
become 
vehement, 
but 
almost 
always 
<a href="/cZl/Wa5iPTJ71oqw.html">did</a> 
become 
vehement, 
scolded,
and 
sometimes 
flung 
the 
exercise 
book 
away.

The 
princess 
gave 
a 
wrong 
answer.

"Well 
now, 
isn't 
she 
a 
fool!" 
shouted 
the 
prince, 
pushing 
the 
book
aside 
and 
turning 
sharply 
away; 
but 
rising 
immediately, 
he 
paced 
up 
and
down, 
lightly 
touched 
his 
daughter's 
hair 
and 
sat 
down 
again.

He 
drew 
up 
his 
chair, 
and 
continued 
to 
explain.

"This 
won't 
do, 
Princess; 
it 
won't 
do," 
said 
he, 
when 
Princess
Mary, 
having 
taken 
and 
closed 
the 
exercise 
book 
with 
the 
next 
day's
lesson, 
was 
about 
to 
leave: 
"Mathematics 
are

madam!
I 
don't

ladies. 
Get 
used 
to 
it 
and
you'll 
like 
it," 
and 
he 
patted 
her 
cheek. 
"It 
will 
drive 
all 
the
nonsense 
out 
of 
your 
head."

She 
turned 
to 
go, 
but 
he 
stopped 
her 
with 
a 
gesture 
and 
took 
an 
uncut
book 
from 
the 
high 
desk.

"Here 
is 
some 
sort 
of 
Key 
to 
the 
Mysteries 
that 
your 
Heloise 
has
sent 
you. 
Religious! 
I

with 
anyone's 
belief... 
I
have 
looked 
at 
it. 
Take 
it. 
Well, 
now 
go. 
Go."

He 
patted 
her 
on 
the 
shoulder 
and 
himself 
closed 
the 
door 
after 
her.

Princess 
Mary 
went 
back 
to 
her 
room 
with 
the 
sad, 
scared 
expression 
that
rarely 
left 
her 
and 
which 
made 
her 
plain, 
sickly 
face 
yet 
plainer. 
She
sat 
down 
at 
her 
writing 
table, 
on 
which 
stood 
miniature<p>
portraits 
and
which 
was 
littered 
with 
books 
and 
papers. 
The 
princess 
was 
as 
untidy 
as
her 
father 
was 
tidy. 
She 
put 
down 
the<p>
geometry 
book 
and 
eagerly 
broke
the 
seal 
of 
her 
letter. 
It 
was 
from 
her 
most 
intimate 
friend 
from
childhood; 
that 
same 
Julie 
Karagina 
who 
had 
been 
at 
the 
Rostovs'
name-day 
party.

Julie 
wrote 
in 
French:

Dear 
and 
precious 
Friend, 
How 
terrible 
and 
frightful 
a 
thing 
is
separation! 
Though 
I 
tell 
myself 
that 
half 
my 
life 
and 
half 
my 
happiness
are 
wrapped 
up 
in 
you, 
and 
that 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
distance 
separating 
us
our 
hearts 
are 
united 
by 
indissoluble 
bonds, 
my 
heart 
rebels 
against
fate 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
the 
pleasures 
and 
distractions 
around 
me 
I 
cannot
overcome 
a 
certain 
secret 
sorrow 
that 
has 
been 
in 
my 
heart 
ever 
since
we 
parted. 
Why 
are 
we 
not 
together 
as 
we 
were 
last 
summer,

your

on 
the

Why 
cannot 
I

as
three 
months 
ago, 
draw 
fresh<p>
moral 
strength 
from 
your 
look, 
so 
gentle,
calm, 
and 
penetrating, 
a 
look 
I 
loved 
so 
well 
and 
seem 
to 
see

me
as 
I 
write?

Having 
read 
thus 
far, 
Princess 
Mary 
sighed 
and 
glanced 
into 
the 
mirror
which 
stood 
on 
her 
right. 
It 
reflected 
a 
weak, 
ungraceful 
figure 
and

face.<p>
Her 
eyes,<p>

looked

her 
reflection 
in 
the 
glass. 
"She 
flatters 
me," 
thought 
the
princess, 
turning 
away 
and 
continuing 
to 
read.

He 
felt 
it

a
lucky 
man 
and, 
with 
his 
plain 
face, 
to 
be 
looked 
on 
as 
a

of 
Paris
possessed 
of 
a 
Helen. 
"But 
no 
doubt 
it 
always

and 
must 
be 
so!"
he 
consoled 
himself. 
"And 
besides, 
what 
have 
I 
done 
to 
bring 
it 
about?
How 
did 
it 
begin? 
I 
traveled 
from 
Moscow 
with 
Prince 
Vasili. 
Then 
there
was 
nothing. 
So 
why 
should 
I 
not 
stay 
at 
his 
house? 
Then 
I 
played

her 
and 
picked

her

And

as 
her 
betrothed, 
seeing, 
hearing, 
feeling 
her 
nearness, 
her
breathing, 
her

her 
beauty. 
Then 
it 
would 
suddenly 
seem 
to 
him
that 
it 
was 
not 
she 
but 
he 
was 
so 
unusually 
beautiful, 
and 
that 
that 
was
why 
they 
all 
looked 
so 
at 
him, 
and 
flattered 
by 
this 
general 
admiration
he 
would 
expand 
his 
chest, 
raise 
his 
head, 
and 
rejoice 
at 
his 
good
fortune. 
Suddenly 
he 
heard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
repeating 
something 
to 
him 
a
second 
time. 
But 
Pierre 
was 
so 
absorbed 
that 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
what
was 
said.

"I 
am 
asking 
you 
when 
you 
last 
heard 
from 
Bolkonski," 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili 
a 
third 
time. 
"How 
absent-minded 
you 
are, 
my 
dear
fellow."

Prince 
Vasili 
smiled, 
and 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
everyone 
was 
smiling 
at
him 
and 
Helene. 
"Well, 
what 
of 
it, 
if 
you 
all 
know 
it?" 
thought
Pierre. 
"What 
of 
it? 
It's 
the 
truth!" 
and 
he 
himself 
smiled 
his
gentle 
childlike 
smile, 
and 
Helene 
smiled 
too.

"When 
did 
you 
get 
the 
letter? 
Was 
it 
from 
Olmuetz?" 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili, 
who 
pretended 
to 
want 
to 
know 
this 
in 
order 
to 
settle 
a
dispute.

"How 
can 
one 
talk 
or 
think 
of 
such 
trifles?" 
thought 
Pierre.

"Yes, 
from 
Olmuetz," 
he 
answered, 
with 
a 
sigh.

After 
supper 
Pierre 
with 
his 
partner 
followed 
the 
others 
into 
the
drawing 
room.

CHAPTER 
XIV

Through 
the 
cross 
streets 
of 
the 
Khamovniki 
quarter 
the 
prisoners
marched, 
followed 
only 
by 
their 
escort 
and 
the 
vehicles 
and 
wagons
belonging 
to 
that 
escort, 
but 
when 
they 
reached 
the 
supply 
stores 
they
came 
among 
a 
huge 
and 
closely 
packed 
train 
of 
artillery 
mingled 
with
private 
vehicles.

At 
the 
bridge 
they 
all 
halted, 
waiting 
for 
those 
in 
front 
to 
get 
across.
From 
the 
bridge 
they 
had 
a 
view 
of 
endless 
lines 
of 
moving 
baggage
trains 
before 
and 
behind 
them. 
To 
the 
right, 
where 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
turns
near 
Neskuchny, 
endless 
rows 
of 
troops 
and 
carts 
stretched 
away 
into
the 
distance. 
These 
were 
troops 
of 
Beauharnais' 
corps 
which 
had 
started
before 
any 
of 
the 
others. 
Behind, 
along 
the 
riverside 
and 
across 
the
Stone 
Bridge, 
were 
Ney's 
troops 
and 
transport.

Davout's<p>
troops, 
in 
whose 
charge 
were 
the 
prisoners, 
were 
crossing 
the
Crimean 
bridge 
and 
some 
were 
already 
debouching 
into 
the 
Kaluga 
road.
But 
the 
baggage 
trains 
stretched 
out 
so 
that 
the 
last 
of 
Beauharnais'
train 
had 
not 
yet 
got 
out 
of 
Moscow 
and 
reached 
the<p>
Kaluga 
road 
when
the 
vanguard 
of 
Ney's 
army 
was 
already 
emerging 
from 
the 
Great 
Ordynka
Street.

When 
they 
had 
crossed 
the 
Crimean 
bridge 
the 
prisoners 
moved<p>

few 
steps
forward,

In 
Russia 
there
was 
an 
Emperor, 
Alexander, 
who 
decided 
to 
restore 
order 
in 
Europe 
and
therefore 
fought 
against 
Napoleon. 
In 
1807 
he 
suddenly 
made 
friends
with 
him, 
but 
in 
1811 
they 
again 
quarreled 
and 
again 
began 
killing 
many
people. 
Napoleon 
led 
six 
hundred 
thousand 
men 
into 
Russia 
and 
captured
Moscow; 
then 
he 
suddenly 
ran 
away 
from 
Moscow, 
and 
the 
Emperor
Alexander, 
helped 
by 
the 
advice 
of 
Stein 
and<p>
others, 
united 
Europe 
to
arm 
against 
the 
disturber 
of 
its 
peace. 
All 
Napoleon's 
allies 
suddenly
became 
his 
enemies 
and 
their 
forces 
advanced 
against 
the 
fresh 
forces 
he
raised. 
The<p>
Allies 
defeated 
Napoleon, 
entered 
Paris, 
forced 
Napoleon 
to
abdicate, 
and 
sent 
him 
to 
the 
island 
of 
Elba, 
not 
depriving 
<a href="/cZl/omA43bOIDr7tjjJI.html">him</a> 
of 
the
title 
of 
Emperor 
and 
showing 
him 
every

though<p>
five 
years 
before
and 
one 
year 
later 
they 
all 
regarded 
him 
as 
an 
outlaw 
and 
a 
brigand.
Then 
Louis 
XVIII, 
who 
till 
then 
had 
been 
the 
laughingstock 
both 
of 
the
French 
and 
the 
Allies, 
began 
to 
reign. 
And 
Napoleon, 
shedding 
tears
before 
his 
Old 
Guards, 
renounced 
the 
throne 
and 
went 
into 
exile. 
Then
the 
skillful 
statesmen 
and 
diplomatists 
(especially 
Talleyrand, 
who
managed 
to 
sit 
down 
in<p>
a 
particular 
chair 
before 
anyone 
else 
and
thereby 
extended 
the 
frontiers 
of 
France) 
talked 
in 
Vienna 
and 
by
these 
conversations 
made 
the 
nations 
happy 
or 
unhappy. 
Suddenly 
the
diplomatists 
and 
monarchs 
nearly 
quarreled 
and 
were 
on 
the 
point 
of
again 
ordering 
their 
armies 
to 
kill 
one 
another, 
but 
just 
then 
Napoleon
arrived 
in 
France 
with 
a 
battalion, 
and 
the 
French, 
who 
had 
been 
hating
him, 
immediately 
all 
submitted 
to 
him. 
But 
the 
Allied 
monarchs 
were
angry 
at 
this 
and 
went 
to 
fight 
the 
French 
once 
more. 
And 
they 
defeated
the 
genius 
Napoleon 
and, 
suddenly 
recognizing 
him 
as 
a 
brigand, 
sent 
him
to 
the 
island 
of 
St. 
Helena. 
And 
the 
exile, 
separated 
from 
the 
beloved
France 
so 
dear 
to 
his 
heart, 
died 
a 
lingering 
death 
on 
that 
rock 
and
bequeathed 
his 
great 
deeds 
to 
posterity. 
But 
in 
Europe<p>
a 
reaction

the 
sovereigns

the

The 
strangeness

these

what

the
power

To 
this, 
modern

laboriously

either 
that 
Napoleon 
was 
a

or 
that 
Louis

or 
that 
certain

wrote 
certain

mankind

and 
began 
to 
cry.

"A 
little 
wound, 
but 
he 
has 
been 
made 
an 
officer; 
he 
is 
well 
now, 
he
wrote 
himself," 
said 
she 
through 
her 
tears.

"There 
now! 
It's 
true 
that 
all 
you 
women 
are 
crybabies," 
remarked
Petya, 
pacing 
the 
room 
with 
large, 
resolute 
strides. 
"Now 
I'm 
very
glad, 
very 
glad 
indeed, 
that 
my 
brother 
has 
distinguished 
himself 
so.
You 
are 
all 
blubberers<p>
and 
understand 
nothing."

Natasha 
smiled 
through 
her 
tears.

"You 
haven't 
read 
the 
letter?" 
asked 
Sonya.

"No, 
but 
she 
<a href="/aVzUge/gJL2AgW2UGRY0uIRD.html">said</a> 
that 
it 
was 
all 
over 
and 
that 
he's 
now 
an
officer."

"Thank 
God!" 
said 
Sonya, 
crossing 
herself. 
"But 
perhaps 
she
deceived 
you. 
Let 
us 
go 
to 
Mamma."

Petya 
paced 
the 
room 
in 
silence 
for 
a 
time.

"If 
I'd 
been 
in 
Nikolenka's 
place 
I 
would 
have 
killed 
even 
more
of 
those 
Frenchmen," 
he 
said. 
"What 
nasty 
brutes 
they 
are! 
I'd
have 
killed<p>
so 
many 
that 
there'd 
have 
been 
a 
heap 
of 
them."

"Hold 
your 
tongue, 
Petya, 
what 
a 
goose 
you 
are!"

"I'm 
not 
a 
goose, 
but 
they 
are 
who 
cry 
about 
trifles," 
said
Petya.

"Do 
you 
remember 
him?" 
Natasha 
suddenly 
asked, 
after 
a 
moment's
silence.

Sonya 
smiled.

"Do 
I 
remember 
Nicholas?"

"No, 
Sonya, 
but 
do 
you 
remember 
so 
that 
you 
remember 
him 
perfectly,
remember 
everything?" 
said 
Natasha, 
with 
an 
expressive 
gesture,
evidently 
wishing 
to 
give 
her 
words 
a 
very 
definite 
meaning. 
"I
remember 
Nikolenka 
too, 
I 
remember 
him 
well," 
she 
said. 
"But 
I
don't 
remember 
Boris. 
I 
don't 
remember 
him 
a 
bit."

"What! 
You 
don't 
remember 
Boris?" 
asked 
Sonya 
in 
surprise.

"It's 
not 
that 
I 
don't 
remember-I 
know 
what 
he 
is 
like, 
but 
not
as 
I 
remember 
Nikolenka. 
Him-I 
just 
shut 
my 
eyes 
and 
remember,
but 
Boris... 
No!" 
(She 
shut 
her 
eyes.) 
"No! 
there's 
nothing 
at
all."

"Oh, 
Natasha!" 
said 
Sonya, 
looking 
ecstatically 
and 
earnestly 
at
her 
friend 
as 
if 
she 
did 
not 
consider 
her 
worthy 
to 
hear 
what 
she 
meant
to 
say 
and 
as 
if 
she 
were 
saying 
it 
to 
someone 
else, 
with 
whom 
joking
was 
out 
of 
the 
question, 
"I

Natasha

wondering 
and 
inquisitive

and 
said
nothing.

Meeting
Bagration's

on 
the 
Znaim

he 
supposed 
it 
to 
be
Kutuzov's

To 
be 
able 
to 
crush 
it 
absolutely 
he 
awaited
the

a 
three 
days' 
truce 
on

that
both 
armies 
should 
remain 
in 
position 
without 
moving. 
Murat 
declared
that 
negotiations 
for 
peace 
were 
already 
proceeding, 
and 
that 
he
therefore 
offered 
this 
truce 
to 
avoid 
unnecessary 
bloodshed. 
Count
Nostitz, 
the 
Austrian 
general 
occupying 
the 
advanced 
posts, 
believed
Murat's 
emissary 
and 
retired, 
leaving 
Bagration's 
division
exposed. 
Another 
emissary 
rode 
to 
the 
Russian 
line 
to 
announce 
the 
peace
negotiations 
and 
to 
offer 
the 
Russian 
army 
the 
three 
days' 
truce.
Bagration 
replied 
that 
he 
was 
not 
authorized 
either 
to 
accept 
or 
refuse
a 
truce 
and 
sent 
his 
adjutant 
to 
Kutuzov 
to 
report 
the 
offer 
he 
had
received.

A 
truce 
was 
Kutuzov's 
sole 
chance 
of 
gaining 
time, 
giving
Bagration's 
exhausted 
troops 
some 
rest, 
and 
letting 
the 
transport 
and
heavy 
convoys 
(whose 
movements 
were 
concealed 
from 
the 
French) 
advance
if

Znaim. 
The

the

and
a

On

the

he 
immediately

also 
to

That
was 
all 
he 
thought 
about 
yesterday's 
ball, 
and 
after 
his 
morning 
tea
he 
set 
to 
work.

But 
either 
from 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZN11tHdfO4ZS.html">fatigue</a> 
or 
want 
of 
sleep 
he 
was 
ill-disposed 
for 
work
and 
could 
get 
<a href="/aVzUge/nyn3pVEYz3DkS9Jn.html">nothing</a> 
done. 
He 
kept 
criticizing 
his 
own 
work, 
as 
he
often 
did, 
and 
was 
glad 
when 
he 
heard 
someone 
coming.

The 
visitor 
was 
Bitski, 
who 
served 
on 
various 
committees, 
frequented
all 
the 
societies 
in 
Petersburg, 
and 
was 
a 
passionate 
devotee 
of 
the 
new
ideas 
and 
of 
Speranski, 
and 
a 
diligent 
Petersburg 
newsmonger-one 
of
those 
men 
who 
choose 
their 
opinions 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SL6ej5WVP7nZs.html">like</a> 
their 
clothes 
according 
to
the 
fashion, 
but 
who 
for 
that 
very 
reason 
appear 
to 
be 
the 
warmest
partisans. 
Hardly 
had 
he 
got 
rid 
of 
his 
hat 
before 
he 
ran 
into 
Prince
Andrew's 
room 
with 
a<p>
preoccupied 
air 
and 
at 
once 
began 
talking. 
He
had 
just 
heard 
particulars 
of 
that 
morning's 
sitting 
of 
the 
Council
of 
State 
opened 
by 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
he 
spoke 
of 
it 
enthusiastically. 
The
Emperor's 
speech 
had 
been 
extraordinary. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
speech 
such 
as
only 
constitutional 
monarchs 
deliver. 
"The 
Sovereign 
plainly 
said
that 
the 
Council 
and 
Senate 
are 
estates 
of 
the 
realm, 
he 
said 
that 
the
government 
must 
rest 
not 
on 
authority 
but 
on 
secure 
bases. 
The 
Emperor
said 
that 
the 
fiscal 
system 
must 
be 
reorganized 
and 
the 
accounts
published," 
recounted 
Bitski, 
emphasizing 
certain 
words 
and 
opening
his 
eyes 
significantly.

"Ah, 
yes! 
Today's 
events 
mark 
an 
epoch, 
the 
greatest 
epoch 
in<p>
our
history," 
he 
concluded.

Prince 
Andrew 
listened 
to 
the 
account 
of 
the 
opening<p>
of 
the 
Council 
of
State, 
which 
he 
had 
so 
impatiently 
awaited 
and 
to 
which 
he 
had 
attached
such 
importance, 
and 
was 
surprised 
that 
this 
event, 
now 
that 
it 
had
taken 
place, 
did 
not 
affect 
him, 
and 
even 
seemed 
quite 
insignificant. 
He
listened 
with 
quiet 
irony 
to 
Bitski's 
enthusiastic 
account 
of 
it. 
A
very<p>
simple 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him: 
"What 
does 
it 
matter 
to 
me 
or 
to
Bitski 
what 
the 
Emperor 
was 
pleased 
to 
say 
at 
the 
Council? 
Can 
all 
that
make 
me 
any 
happier 
or 
better?"

And 
this 
simple 
reflection 
suddenly 
destroyed 
all 
the 
interest 
Prince
Andrew 
had 
felt 
in 
the 
impending 
reforms. 
He 
was 
going 
to 
dine 
that
evening 
at 
Speranski's, 
"with 
only 
a 
few 
friends," 
as 
the 
host
had 
said 
when 
inviting 
him. 
The 
prospect 
of 
that 
dinner 
in 
the 
intimate
home 
circle 
of 
the 
man 
he 
so 
admired 
had 
greatly 
interested 
Prince
Andrew, 
especially 
as 
he 
had 
not 
yet 
seen 
Speranski 
in 
his 
domestic
surroundings, 
but 
now 
he 
felt 
disinclined 
to 
go 
to 
it.

In 
the 
total 
darkness 
the 
soldiers 
walked 
with 
Pierre 
to 
Mozhaysk.

By 
the 
time 
they 
got 
near 
Mozhaysk 
and 
began 
ascending 
the 
steep 
hill
into 
the 
town, 
the 
cocks 
were 
already 
crowing. 
Pierre 
went 
on 
with 
the
soldiers, 
quite 
forgetting 
<a href="/aVzUge/bmp3Url9qrwB.html">that</a> 
his 
inn 
was 
at 
the

that

He 
would

such 
was 
his 
state 
of 
forgetfulness, 
had 
he 
not

upon 
his

who 
had 
been 
to 
look 
for 
him 
in 
the
town 
and 
was 
returning 
to 
the 
inn. 
The 
groom 
recognized 
Pierre 
in 
the
darkness 
by 
his 
white 
hat.

"Your 
excellency!" 
he 
said. 
"Why, 
we 
were 
beginning 
<a href="/aVzUge/qQ69oFcgw4PUmnH.html">to</a>

How

are 
on

And 
where 
are

"Oh, 
yes!" 
said 
Pierre.

The 
soldiers 
stopped.

"So 
you've 
found 
your 
folk?" 
said 
one 
of 
them. 
"Well, 
good-by, 
Peter
Kirilych-isn't 
it?"

"Good-by, 
Peter 
Kirilych!" 
Pierre 
heard 
the

voices 
repeat.

"Good-by!" 
he 
said 
and 
turned 
with 
his 
groom 
toward 
the<p>

"I

them 
something!" 
he<p>
thought, 
and 
felt 
in 
his 
pocket.
"No,

not!" 
said 
another, 
inner 
voice.

There 
was 
not 
a 
room 
to 
be 
had 
at 
the 
inn, 
they 
were 
all 
occupied.
Pierre 
went 
out 
into 
the 
yard 
and, 
covering 
himself 
up 
head 
and 
all, 
lay
down 
in 
his 
carriage.





CHAPTER 
IX

Scarcely 
had 
Pierre 
laid 
his 
head 
on 
the 
pillow 
before 
he 
felt 
himself
falling 
asleep, 
but 
suddenly, 
almost 
with 
the 
distinctness 
of 
reality,
he 
heard 
the 
boom, 
boom, 
boom 
of 
firing, 
the 
thud 
of 
projectiles, 
groans
and 
cries, 
and 
smelled 
blood 
and 
powder, 
and 
a 
feeling 
of 
horror 
and
dread 
of 
death 
seized 
him. 
Filled 
with 
fright 
he 
opened 
his 
eyes 
and
lifted 
his 
head 
from 
under 
his 
cloak. 
All 
was 
tranquil 
in 
the 
yard. 
Only
someone's 
orderly 
passed 
through 
the 
gateway, 
splashing 
through 
the 
mud,
and 
talked 
to 
the 
innkeeper. 
Above 
Pierre's 
head 
some 
pigeons, 
disturbed
by 
the 
movement 
he 
had 
made 
in 
sitting 
up, 
fluttered 
under 
the 
dark 
roof
of 
the 
penthouse. 
The 
whole 
courtyard 
was 
permeated 
by 
a 
strong 
peaceful
smell 
of 
stable 
yards, 
delightful 
to 
Pierre 
at 
that 
moment. 
He 
could 
see
the 
clear 
starry 
sky 
between 
the 
dark<p>
roofs 
of 
two 
penthouses.

"Thank 
God, 
there 
is 
no 
more 
of 
that!" 
he 
thought, 
covering 
up 
his 
head
again. 
"Oh, 
what 
a 
terrible 
thing 
is 
fear, 
and 
how 
shamefully 
I 
yielded
to 
it!

thought 
he.

They, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Bw7YWUw4H6trTR.html">in</a> 
Pierre's 
mind, 
were 
the 
soldiers,

As 
soon 
as 
the 
sun 
appeared 
in 
a 
clear 
strip 
of 
sky 
beneath 
the 
clouds,
the 
wind 
fell, 
as 
if 
it 
dared 
not 
spoil 
the 
beauty 
of 
the 
summer 
morning
after 
the 
storm; 
drops 
still 
continued 
to 
fall, 
but 
vertically 
now, 
and
all 
was 
still. 
The 
whole 
sun 
appeared 
on 
the 
horizon 
and 
disappeared
behind 
a 
long 
narrow 
cloud 
that<p>
hung 
above 
it. 
A 
few 
minutes 
later 
it
reappeared 
brighter 
still 
from 
behind 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cloud, 
tearing 
its
edge. 
Everything 
grew 
bright 
and 
glittered. 
And 
with 
that 
light, 
and 
as
if 
in 
reply 
to 
it, 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
guns 
ahead 
of 
them.

Before 
Rostov 
had 
had 
time 
to 
consider 
and 
determine 
the 
distance 
of
that 
firing, 
Count 
Ostermann-Tolstoy's 
adjutant 
came 
galloping 
from
Vitebsk 
with 
orders 
to 
advance 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
road.

The 
squadron 
overtook 
and 
passed 
the 
infantry 
and 
the 
battery-which 
had
also 
quickened 
their 
pace-rode 
down 
a 
hill, 
and 
passing 
through 
an 
empty
and 
deserted 
village 
again 
ascended. 
The 
horses 
began 
to 
lather 
and 
the
men 
to 
flush.

"Halt! 
Dress 
your 
ranks!" 
the 
order 
of 
the 
regimental 
commander 
was
heard 
ahead. 
"Forward 
by 
the 
left. 
Walk, 
march!" 
came 
the 
order 
from 
in
front.

And 
the 
hussars, 
passing 
along 
the 
line 
of 
troops 
on 
the 
left 
flank 
of
our 
position, 
halted 
behind 
our 
Uhlans 
who 
were 
in 
the 
front 
line. 
To
the 
right 
stood 
our 
infantry 
in 
a 
dense 
column: 
they 
were 
the 
reserve.
Higher 
up 
the 
hill, 
on 
the 
very 
horizon, 
our 
guns 
were<p>
visible 
through
the 
wonderfully 
clear 
air, 
brightly 
illuminated 
by 
slanting 
morning
sunbeams. 
In 
front, 
beyond 
a 
hollow 
dale, 
could 
be 
seen 
the 
enemy's
columns 
and 
guns. 
Our 
advanced 
line, 
already 
in 
action, 
could 
be 
heard
briskly 
exchanging 
shots 
with 
the 
enemy<p>
in 
the 
dale.

At 
these 
sounds, 
long 
unheard, 
Rostov's 
spirits 
rose, 
as 
at 
the 
strains
of 
the 
merriest 
music. 
Trap-ta-ta-tap! 
cracked 
the 
shots, 
now 
together,
now 
several 
quickly 
one 
after 
another. 
Again 
all 
was 
silent 
and 
then
again 
it 
sounded 
as 
if 
someone 
were 
walking 
on 
detonators 
and 
exploding
them.

The 
hussars 
remained 
in 
the 
same 
place 
for 
about 
an 
hour. 
A 
cannonade
began. 
Count 
Ostermann 
with 
his 
suite 
rode 
up 
behind 
the 
squadron,
halted, 
spoke 
to 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
regiment, 
and 
rode 
up 
the 
hill 
to
the 
guns.

After 
Ostermann 
had 
gone, 
a 
command 
rang 
out 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/bj5pWxqu9.html">the</a> 
Uhlans.

"Form 
column! 
Prepare 
to 
charge!"

The 
infantry 
in 
front 
of 
them 
parted 
into 
platoons 
to 
allow 
the 
cavalry
to 
pass. 
The 
Uhlans 
started, 
the 
streamers 
on 
their 
spears 
fluttering,
and 
trotted 
downhill 
toward 
the 
French 
cavalry 
which 
was 
seen 
below

"That's</h1>happiness!"

Into 
the 
insignificant, 
trifling, 
and 
artificial 
interests 
uniting 
that
society 
had 
entered 
the 
simple 
feeling 
of 
the 
attraction 
of 
a 
healthy
and 
handsome 
young 
man<p>
and 
woman 
for 
one 
another. 
And 
this 
human 
feeling
dominated 
everything 
else 
and 
soared 
above 
all 
their 
affected 
chatter.
Jests 
fell 
flat, 
news 
was 
not 
interesting, 
and 
the 
<a href="/cZl/DC3W0vWPe1.html">animation</a> 
was
evidently 
forced. 
Not 
only 
the 
guests 
but 
even 
the 
footmen 
waiting 
at
table 
seemed 
to 
feel 
this, 
and 
they 
forgot 
their 
duties 
as 
they 
looked
at 
the 
beautiful 
Helene 
with 
her 
radiant 
face 
and 
at 
the 
red, 
broad,
and 
happy 
though 
uneasy 
face 
of 
Pierre. 
It 
seemed 
as 
if 
the 
very 
light
of 
the 
candles 
was 
focused 
on 
those 
two 
happy 
faces 
alone.

Pierre 
felt 
that<p>
he 
was 
the 
center 
of 
it 
all, 
and 
this 
both 
pleased 
and
embarrassed 
him. 
He 
was 
like 
a 
man 
entirely 
absorbed 
in 
some 
occupation.
He 
did 
not 
see, 
hear, 
or 
understand 
anything 
clearly. 
Only 
now 
and
then 
detached 
ideas 
and 
impressions 
from 
the 
world 
of 
reality 
shot
unexpectedly 
through 
his 
mind.

"So 
it 
is 
all 
finished!" 
he 
thought. 
"And 
how 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qm8As2CMvYt8FlpJ.html">has</a> 
it 
all 
happened?
How 
quickly! 
Now 
I 
know 
that 
not 
because 
of 
her 
alone, 
nor 
of 
myself
alone, 
but 
because 
of 
everyone, 
it 
must 
inevitably 
come 
about. 
They 
are
all 
expecting 
it, 
they 
are 
so 
sure 
that 
it 
will 
happen 
that 
I 
cannot, 
I
cannot, 
disappoint 
them. 
But 
how 
will 
it 
be? 
I 
do 
not 
know, 
but 
it
will 
certainly 
happen!" 
thought 
Pierre, 
glancing 
at 
those 
dazzling
shoulders 
close 
to 
his 
eyes.

Or 
he 
would 
suddenly 
feel 
ashamed 
of 
he 
knew 
not 
what. 
He 
felt 
it
awkward 
to 
attract 
everyone's 
attention 
and 
to 
be 
considered 
a
lucky 
man 
and, 
with 
his 
plain 
face, 
to

conflagrations 
when 
the

"Le

"Just

took

to 
him, 
gripped

in 
his
fist,<p>

scattered

threw

away.
Then 
he 
remained 
silent 
for 
a 
while, 
and 
all 
at 
once 
looked 
cheerfully
with 
his 
glittering, 
black 
eyes 
at 
Rostov.

"If 
at

we 
had 
some

Hullo,

he 
said, 
turning 
to 
the 
door 
as 
he 
heard 
a 
tread 
of 
heavy
boots 
and 
the 
clinking 
of 
spurs 
that 
came 
to 
a 
stop, 
and 
a 
respectful
cough.

"The 
squadron 
quartermaster!" 
said 
Lavrushka.

Denisov's 
face 
puckered 
still 
more.

"Wetched!" 
he 
muttered, 
throwing 
down 
a 
purse 
with 
some 
gold 
in 
it.
"Wostov, 
deah 
fellow, 
just 
see 
how 
much 
there 
is 
left 
and 
shove 
the
purse 
undah 
the 
pillow," 
he 
said, 
and 
went 
out 
to 
the 
quartermaster.

Rostov 
took 
the 
money 
and, 
mechanically 
arranging 
the 
old<p>
and 
new 
coins
in 
separate 
piles, 
began 
counting 
them.

"Ah! 
Telyanin! 
How 
d'ye 
do? 
They 
plucked 
me 
last 
night," 
came
Denisov's 
voice 
from 
the 
next 
room.

"Where? 
At 
Bykov's, 
at 
the 
rat's... 
I 
knew 
it," 
replied 
a 
piping
voice, 
and 
Lieutenant 
Telyanin, 
a 
small 
officer 
of 
the 
same 
squadron,
entered 
the 
room.

Rostov 
thrust 
the 
purse 
under 
the 
pillow 
and 
shook 
the 
damp 
little 
hand
which 
was 
offered 
him. 
Telyanin 
for 
some 
reason 
had 
been 
transferred
from 
the 
Guards 
just 
before 
this 
campaign. 
He 
behaved 
very 
well 
in 
the
regiment 
but 
was 
not 
liked; 
Rostov 
especially 
detested 
him 
and 
was
unable 
to 
overcome 
or 
conceal 
his 
groundless 
antipathy 
to 
the 
man.

"Well, 
young 
cavalryman, 
how 
is 
my 
Rook 
behaving?" 
he 
asked. 
(Rook
was 
a 
young 
horse 
Telyanin 
had 
sold 
to 
Rostov.)

The 
lieutenant 
never 
looked 
the 
man 
he 
was 
speaking 
to 
straight 
in 
the
face; 
his 
eyes 
continually 
wandered 
from 
one 
object 
to 
another.

"I 
saw 
you 
riding 
this 
morning..." 
he 
added.

"Oh, 
he's 
all 
right, 
a 
good 
horse," 
answered 
Rostov, 
though 
the
horse 
for 
which 
he 
had 
paid 
seven 
hundred 
rubbles 
was 
not 
worth 
half
that 
sum. 
"He's<p>
begun 
to 
go 
a 
little 
lame 
on 
the 
left 
foreleg," 
he
added.

"The 
hoof's 
cracked! 
That's 
nothing. 
I'll 
teach 
you 
what 
to 
do
and 
show 
you 
what 
kind 
of 
rivet 
to 
use."

"Yes, 
please 
do," 
said 
Rostov.

"I'll 
show 
you, 
I'll 
show 
you! 
It's 
not 
a 
secret. 
And 
it's 
a
horse 
you'll<p>
thank 
me 
for."

"Then 
I'll 
have 
it 
brought 
round," 
said 
Rostov 
wishing 
to 
avoid
Telyanin, 
and 
he 
went 
out 
to 
give 
the 
order.

In 
the 
passage 
Denisov, 
with 
a 
pipe, 
was 
squatting 
on 
the 
threshold
facing 
the 
quartermaster 
who 
was 
reporting 
to 
him. 
On 
seeing 
Rostov,
Denisov 
screwed 
up 
his 
face 
and 
pointing 
over 
his 
shoulder 
with 
his
thumb 
to 
the 
room 
where 
Telyanin 
was 
sitting, 
he 
frowned 
and 
gave 
a
shudder 
of 
disgust.

"Ugh! 
I 
don't 
like 
that 
fellow," 
he 
said, 
regardless 
of 
the
quartermaster's 
presence.

Rostov 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders 
as 
much 
as 
to 
say: 
"Nor<p>
do 
I, 
but
what's 
one 
to 
do?" 
and, 
having 
given 
his 
order, 
he 
returned 
to
Telyanin.

Telyanin 
was 
sitting 
in 
the 
same 
indolent 
pose 
in 
which 
Rostov 
had
left 
him, 
rubbing 
his 
small 
white 
hands.

balls

flying 
all

hitting 
men 
and 
that 
afterwards 
someone 
had 
shouted 
"Cavalry!" 
and
our 
men 
had 
begun 
firing. 
They 
were 
still 
firing, 
not 
at 
the 
cavalry
which 
had 
disappeared, 
but 
at 
French 
infantry 
who 
had 
come 
into 
the
hollow 
and 
were 
firing 
at 
our 
men. 
Prince 
Bagration 
bowed 
his 
head 
as 
a
sign 
that 
this 
was 
exactly 
what 
he 
had 
desired 
and 
expected. 
Turning
to 
his 
adjutant 
he 
ordered 
him 
to 
bring 
down 
the 
two 
battalions 
of 
the
Sixth 
Chasseurs

they

Prince

struck 
by
the

Prince 
Bagration's 
face 
at 
this

It

who 
on 
a 
hot 
day 
takes 
a 
final 
run 
before 
plunging 
into 
the 
water.
The 
dull, 
sleepy<p>
expression 
was 
no 
longer 
there, 
nor 
the 
affectation
of 
profound 
thought. 
The 
round, 
steady, 
hawk's 
eyes 
looked 
before 
him
eagerly 
and 
rather 
disdainfully, 
not 
resting 
on 
anything 
although 
his
movements 
were 
still 
slow 
and 
measured.

The 
commander 
of 
the 
regiment 
turned 
to 
Prince 
Bagration, 
entreating
him 
to 
go 
back 
as 
it 
was 
too 
dangerous 
to 
remain 
where 
they 
were.
"Please, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NXJ5AHAK.html">your</a> 
excellency,<p>
for 
God's 
sake!" 
he 
kept 
saying,
glancing 
for 
support 
at 
an 
officer 
of 
the 
suite 
who 
turned 
away
from 
him. 
"There, 
you 
see!" 
and 
he 
drew 
attention 
to 
the 
bullets
whistling, 
singing, 
and 
hissing 
continually 
around 
them. 
He<p>
spoke 
in 
the
tone 
of 
entreaty 
and 
reproach 
that 
a 
carpenter 
uses 
to 
a 
gentleman 
who
has 
picked 
up 
an 
ax: 
"We 
are 
used 
to 
it, 
but 
you, 
sir, 
will 
blister
your 
hands." 
He 
spoke 
as 
if 
those 
bullets 
could 
not 
kill 
him, 
and 
his
half-closed 
eyes 
gave 
still 
more 
persuasiveness 
to 
his 
words. 
The 
staff
officer 
joined 
in 
the 
colonel's 
appeals, 
but 
Bagration 
did 
not 
reply;
he 
only 
gave 
an 
order 
to 
cease 
firing 
and 
re-form, 
so 
as 
to 
give 
room
for 
the 
two 
approaching 
battalions. 
While 
he 
was 
speaking, 
the 
curtain
of 
smoke 
that 
had 
concealed 
the 
hollow, 
driven 
by 
a 
rising 
wind, 
began
to 
move 
from 
right 
to 
left 
as 
if 
drawn 
by 
an 
invisible 
hand, 
and 
the
hill 
opposite, 
with 
the 
French 
moving 
about 
on 
it, 
opened 
out 
before
them. 
All 
eyes 
fastened 
involuntarily 
on 
this 
French 
column 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/di6HV1ohMq7NSCk.html">advancing
against</a>

"It 
may

said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
vividly 
imagining 
the
gray 
overcoats, 
wounds, 
the 
smoke

the

as 
at

seemed 
to 
be 
trying 
to 
find 
the 
right
expression. 
"C'est...

Nous 
sommes

(It

he 
concluded, 
feeling 
that 
he
had 
produced 
a 
good 
epigram, 
a 
fresh 
one 
that 
would 
be 
repeated. 
His
hitherto 
puckered 
brow 
became 
smooth 
as 
a 
sign 
of 
pleasure, 
and 
with 
a
slight 
smile 
he 
began 
to 
examine 
his 
nails.

"Where 
are 
you 
off 
to?" 
he 
said 
suddenly 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
who 
had
risen 
and 
was 
going 
toward 
his 
room.

"I 
am 
going 
away."

"Where 
to?"

"To 
the 
army."

"But 
you 
meant<p>
to 
stay 
another

"But

I

And 
Prince 
Andrew 
after 
giving 
directions 
about 
his 
departure 
went 
to
his 
room.

"Do 
you 
know, 
mon 
cher," 
said 
Bilibin 
following 
him, 
"I 
have 
been
thinking 
about 
you. 
Why 
are

going?"

And 
in 
proof 
of 
the 
conclusiveness 
of 
his 
opinion 
all 
the 
wrinkles
vanished 
from 
his 
face.

Prince 
Andrew 
looked 
inquiringly 
at 
him 
and 
gave 
no 
reply.

"Why 
are 
you 
going? 
I 
know 
you 
think 
it 
your 
duty 
to 
gallop 
back 
to

now 
that 
it

I 
understand 
that. 
Mon 
cher, 
it 
is
heroism!"

"Not 
at 
all," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

"But 
as 
you 
are 
a 
philosopher, 
be 
a 
consistent 
one, 
look 
at 
the 
other
side 
of 
the 
question 
and 
you 
will 
see 
that 
your

on 
the 
contrary,
is 
to 
take

not

therefore, 
you

and 
Olmuetz 
is 
a

"Do 
stop 
joking, 
Bilibin," 
cried 
Bolkonski.

"I 
am 
speaking 
sincerely 
as 
a 
friend! 
Consider! 
Where 
and 
why 
are
you

when

and 
the 
skin 
over 
his

puckered,

And 
Bilibin 
unwrinkled 
his 
temple, 
feeling 
that 
the 
dilemma 
was
insoluble.

"I

Alpatych 
clung 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
leg 
and 
burst 
into 
sobs. 
Gently
disengaging 
himself, 
the 
prince 
spurred 
his 
horse 
and 
rode 
down 
the
avenue 
at 
a 
gallop.

The 
old 
man 
was 
still 
sitting 
in 
the 
ornamental 
garden, 
like 
a 
fly
impassive 
on 
the 
face 
of 
a 
loved 
one 
who 
is 
dead, 
tapping 
the 
last 
on
which 
he 
was 
making 
the 
bast 
shoe, 
and 
two 
little 
girls, 
running 
out
from 
the 
hot 
house 
carrying 
in 
their 
skirts 
plums 
they 
had 
plucked 
from
the 
trees 
there, 
came 
upon 
Prince 
Andrew. 
On 
seeing 
the 
young 
master,
the 
elder 
one 
with 
frightened 
look 
clutched 
her 
younger 
companion 
by 
the
hand 
and 
hid 
with 
her 
behind 
a 
birch 
tree, 
not 
stopping 
to 
pick 
up 
some
green 
plums 
they 
had 
dropped.

Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
away 
with 
startled 
haste, 
unwilling 
to 
let 
them
see 
that 
they 
had 
been 
observed. 
He 
was 
sorry 
for 
the 
pretty 
frightened
little 
girl, 
was 
afraid 
of 
looking 
at 
her, 
and 
yet 
felt 
an 
irresistible
desire 
to 
do 
so. 
A 
new 
sensation<p>
of 
comfort 
and 
relief 
came 
over 
him
when, 
seeing 
these 
girls, 
he 
realized 
the 
existence 
of 
other 
human
interests 
entirely 
aloof 
from 
his 
own 
and 
just 
as 
legitimate 
as 
those
that 
occupied 
him. 
Evidently 
these 
girls 
passionately 
desired 
one
thing-to 
carry 
away 
and 
eat 
those 
green 
plums 
without 
being 
caught-and
Prince 
Andrew 
shared 
their 
wish 
for 
the 
success 
of 
their 
enterprise. 
He
could 
not 
resist 
looking 
at 
them 
once 
more. 
Believing 
their 
danger 
past,
they 
sprang 
from 
their 
ambush 
and, 
chirruping 
something 
in 
their 
shrill
little 
voices 
and 
holding 
up 
their 
skirts,<p>
their 
bare 
little 
sunburned
feet 
scampered 
merrily 
and 
quickly 
across 
the 
meadow 
grass.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
somewhat 
refreshed 
by 
having<p>
ridden 
off 
the 
dusty
highroad 
along 
which 
the 
troops 
were 
moving. 
But 
not 
far 
from 
Bald 
Hills
he 
again 
came 
out 
on 
the 
road 
and 
overtook 
his 
regiment 
at 
its 
halting
place 
by 
the 
dam 
of 
a 
small 
pond. 
It 
was 
past 
one 
o'clock. 
The 
sun,
a 
red 
ball 
through 
the 
dust, 
burned 
and 
scorched 
his 
back 
intolerably
through 
his 
black 
coat. 
The 
dust 
always 
hung 
motionless 
above 
the 
buzz
of 
talk 
that 
came 
from<p>
the 
resting 
troops. 
There 
was 
no 
wind. 
As 
he
crossed 
the 
dam 
Prince 
Andrew 
smelled 
the 
ooze 
and 
freshness 
of 
the
pond. 
He 
longed 
to 
get

water,

dirty 
it 
might 
be, 
and
he 
glanced 
round 
at

laughter.

Tikhon, 
like

good 
valets, 
instinctively 
knew 
the 
direction 
of 
his
master's 
thoughts. 
He 
guessed 
that

his

into 
the 
sleeves 
of 
his 
dressing
gown, 
he 
went 
to 
the 
couch 
on 
which 
he 
slept.

Though 
no 
words 
had 
passed 
between 
Anatole 
and 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne,
they 
quite 
understood 
one 
<a href="/cZl/iP4INZ3gK6BwgT.html">another</a> 
as 
to 
the 
first 
part 
of 
their 
romance,
up 
to 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
pauvre 
mere; 
they 
understood 
that 
they 
had
much 
to 
say 
to 
one 
another 
in 
private 
and 
so 
they 
had 
been 
seeking 
an
opportunity 
since 
morning 
to 
meet 
one 
another

When 
Princess 
Mary
went 
to 
her 
father's<p>
room 
at 
the 
usual 
hour, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne
and 
Anatole 
met 
in 
the 
conservatory.

Princess 
Mary 
went 
to 
the 
door 
of 
the 
study 
with 
special 
trepidation.
It 
seemed 
to 
her 
that 
not 
only 
did 
everybody 
know 
that 
her 
fate 
would 
be
decided 
that 
day, 
but 
that 
they 
also 
knew 
what 
she 
thought 
about 
it. 
She
read 
this 
in 
Tikhon's 
face 
and 
in 
that 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's 
valet,
who 
made 
her 
a 
low 
bow 
when 
she<p>
met 
him 
in 
the 
corridor 
carrying 
hot
water.

The 
old 
prince 
was 
very 
affectionate 
and 
careful 
in 
his 
treatment 
of
his 
daughter 
that 
morning. 
Princess 
Mary 
well 
knew<p>
this 
painstaking
expression 
of 
her 
father's. 
His 
face 
wore 
that 
expression 
when 
his
dry 
hands 
clenched 
with 
vexation 
at 
her 
not 
understanding 
a 
sum 
in
arithmetic, 
when 
rising 
from 
his 
chair 
he 
would 
walk 
away 
from 
her,
repeating 
in 
a 
low 
voice 
the 
same 
words 
several 
times 
over.

He 
came 
to 
the 
point 
at 
once, 
treating 
her 
ceremoniously.

"I 
have 
had 
a 
proposition

he 
said 
with 
an

as 
a 
"pupil") 
"for 
the 
sake 
of 
my
beautiful 
eyes. 
Last 
night 
a 
proposition 
was 
made<p>
me 
on 
your 
account
and, 
as 
you 
know 
my 
principles, 
I 
refer 
it 
to 
you."

"How 
am 
I 
to 
understand 
you, 
mon 
pere?" 
said 
the 
princess, 
growing
pale 
and 
then 
blushing.

"How 
understand 
me!" 
cried 
her 
father 
angrily. 
"Prince 
Vasili
finds 
you 
to 
his 
taste 
as 
a 
daughter-in-law 
and 
makes 
a 
proposal 
to 
you
on 
his 
pupil's 
behalf. 
That's 
how 
it's 
to 
be 
understood! 
'How
understand 
it'!... 
And 
I 
ask 
you!"

"I 
do 
not 
know 
what 
you 
think, 
Father," 
whispered 
the 
princess.

"I? 
I? 
What 
of 
me? 
Leave 
me 
out 
of 
the 
question. 
I'm 
not 
going 
to
get 
married. 
What 
about 
you? 
That's 
what 
I 
want 
to<p>
know."

The 
princess 
saw 
that 
her 
father 
regarded 
the 
matter 
with 
disapproval,
but 
at 
that 
moment 
the 
thought 
occurred 
to 
her 
that 
her 
fate 
would 
be
decided 
now 
or 
never. 
She 
lowered 
her 
eyes 
so 
as 
not 
to 
see 
the 
gaze
under 
which 
she 
felt 
that 
she 
could 
not 
think, 
but 
would 
only 
be 
able 
to
submit 
from 
habit, 
and 
she 
said: 
"I 
wish 
only 
to 
do 
your 
will, 
but 
if
I 
had 
to 
express 
my 
own 
desire..." 
She 
had 
no 
time 
to 
finish. 
The 
old
prince 
interrupted 
her.

"That's 
admirable!" 
he 
shouted. 
"He 
will 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">take</a> 
you 
with 
your
dowry<p>
and 
take 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
into 
the 
bargain. 
She'll 
be 
the
wife, 
while 
you..."

The 
prince 
stopped. 
He 
saw 
the 
effect 
these 
words 
had 
produced 
on 
his
daughter. 
She 
lowered 
her 
head 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
burst 
into 
tears.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then, 
I'm 
only 
joking!" 
he 
said. 
"Remember 
this,
Princess, 
I 
hold 
to 
the 
principle 
that 
a 
maiden 
has 
a 
full 
right 
to
choose. 
I 
give 
you 
freedom.

Natasha.

EPILOGUE:

CHAPTER 
I

Seven 
years 
had 
passed. 
The 
storm-tossed 
sea 
of 
European 
history 
had
subsided 
within 
its 
shores 
and 
seemed 
to 
have 
become 
calm. 
But 
the
mysterious 
forces 
that 
move 
<a href="/cZl/YF1n5xhd4CKY.html">humanity</a> 
(mysterious 
because 
the 
laws 
of
their 
motion 
are 
unknown 
to 
us) 
continued 
to 
operate.

Though 
the 
surface 
of 
the 
sea 
of 
history 
seemed 
motionless, 
the 
movement
of 
humanity 
went 
on 
as 
unceasingly 
as 
the 
flow 
of 
time. 
Various 
groups
of 
people 
formed 
and 
dissolved, 
the 
coming 
formation 
and 
dissolution 
of
kingdoms 
and 
displacement

and 
that 
his 
jaw 
quivered 
and 
shook 
as 
if 
in 
an
ague.

"Ah, 
my 
friend!" 
said 
he, 
taking 
Pierre 
by 
the 
elbow; 
and 
there 
was
in 
his 
voice 
a 
sincerity 
and 
weakness 
Pierre 
had 
never 
observed 
in 
it
before. 
"How 
often 
we 
sin, 
how 
much 
we 
deceive, 
and 
all 
for 
what? 
I 
am
near 
sixty,<p>
dear 
friend... 
I 
too... 
All 
will 
end 
in 
death, 
all! 
Death 
is
awful..." 
and 
he 
burst 
into 
tears.

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
came 
out 
last. 
She 
approached 
Pierre 
with 
slow, 
quiet
steps.

"Pierre!" 
she 
said.

Pierre 
gave 
her 
an 
inquiring 
look. 
She<p>
kissed 
the<p>
young 
man 
on 
his
forehead, 
wetting 
him 
with 
her 
tears. 
Then 
after 
a 
pause 
she 
said:

"He 
is 
no 
more...."

Pierre 
looked 
at 
her 
over 
his 
spectacles.

"Come, 
I 
will 
go 
with 
you. 
Try 
to 
weep, 
nothing 
gives 
such 
relief 
as
tears."

She 
led 
him 
into 
the 
dark 
drawing 
room 
and 
Pierre 
was 
glad 
no 
one 
could
see 
his 
face. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
left 
him, 
and 
when 
she 
returned 
he 
was
fast 
asleep 
with 
his 
head 
on 
his 
arm.

In 
the 
morning 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
said 
to 
Pierre:

"Yes, 
my 
dear, 
this 
is 
a 
great 
loss 
for 
us 
all, 
not 
to 
speak 
of 
you.
But 
God 
will 
support 
you: 
you 
are 
young,<p>
and 
are 
now, 
I 
hope, 
in 
command
of 
an 
immense 
fortune. 
The 
will 
has 
not 
yet 
been 
opened. 
I 
know 
you
well 
enough 
to 
be 
sure 
that 
this 
will 
not 
turn 
your 
head, 
but 
it 
imposes
duties 
on 
you, 
and 
you 
must 
be 
a 
man."

Pierre 
was 
silent.

"Perhaps 
later 
on 
I 
may 
tell 
you, 
my 
dear 
boy, 
that 
if 
I 
had 
not 
been
there, 
God 
only 
knows 
what 
would 
have 
happened! 
You 
know, 
Uncle 
promised
me 
only 
the 
day 
before 
yesterday 
not 
to 
forget 
Boris. 
But 
he 
had
no 
time. 
I 
hope, 
my 
dear 
friend, 
you 
will 
carry 
out 
your 
father's
wish?"

Pierre 
understood 
nothing 
of 
all 
this 
and 
coloring 
shyly 
looked 
in
silence 
at 
Princess 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna. 
After 
her 
talk 
with 
Pierre, 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
returned 
to 
the<p>
Rostovs' 
and 
went 
to 
bed. 
On 
waking 
in
the 
morning 
she 
told 
the 
Rostovs 
and 
all 
her 
acquaintances 
the 
details
of 
Count<p>
Bezukhov's 
death. 
She 
said 
the 
count 
had 
died 
as 
she 
would
herself 
wish 
to 
die, 
that 
his 
end 
was 
not 
only 
touching 
but 
edifying. 
As
to 
the 
last 
meeting 
between 
father 
and 
son, 
it 
was 
so 
touching 
that 
she
could 
not 
think 
of 
it 
without 
tears, 
and 
did 
not 
know 
which 
had 
behaved
better 
during 
those 
awful 
moments-the 
father 
who 
so 
remembered
everything 
and 
everybody 
at 
last 
and 
had 
spoken 
such 
pathetic 
words 
to
the 
son, 
or<p>
Pierre, 
whom 
it

been 
pitiful

He

Still 
less 
could

More 
than 
once 
he<p>

vexed 
his

he 
laughed 
at

all

He
was 
not 
mean, 
and 
did 
not 
refuse 
anyone 
who 
asked 
of 
him. 
All 
he 
cared
about 
was 
gaiety 
and 
women, 
and 
as 
according 
to 
his 
ideas 
there
was 
nothing 
dishonorable 
in 
these 
tastes, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RZ4R0suxK1vf.html">and</a>

was 
incapable

honestly

bad

and 
with 
a 
tranquil 
conscience 
carried 
his

Rakes, 
those 
male 
Magdalenes, 
have 
a 
secret

innocence
similar 
to 
that 
which 
female 
Magdalenes 
have, 
based 
on 
the 
same 
hope 
of
forgiveness. 
"All 
will 
be 
forgiven 
her, 
for 
she 
loved 
much; 
and 
all
will 
be

Dolokhov, 
who 
had 
reappeared 
that 
year 
in 
Moscow 
after 
his 
exile 
and
his 
Persian 
adventures, 
and 
was 
leading 
a 
life 
of 
luxury, 
gambling, 
and
dissipation, 
associated 
with 
his 
old 
Petersburg 
comrade 
Kuragin 
and
made 
use 
of 
him 
for 
his 
own 
ends.

Anatole 
was 
sincerely 
fond 
of 
Dolokhov 
for 
his 
cleverness 
and
audacity. 
Dolokhov, 
who 
needed 
Anatole 
Kuragin's 
name, 
position, 
and
connections 
as 
a 
bait 
to 
draw 
rich 
young 
men 
into 
his 
gambling 
set, 
made
use 
of 
him 
and 
amused 
himself 
at 
his 
expense 
without 
letting 
the 
other
feel 
it. 
Apart 
from 
the 
advantage 
he 
derived 
from 
Anatole, 
the 
very
process 
of 
dominating 
another's 
will 
was 
in 
itself 
a 
pleasure, 
a
habit, 
and 
a 
necessity 
to 
Dolokhov.

Natasha 
had 
made 
a 
strong 
impression 
on 
Kuragin.<p>
At 
supper 
after
the 
opera 
he 
described 
to 
Dolokhov 
with 
the 
air 
of 
a 
connoisseur 
the
attractions 
of 
her 
arms, 
shoulders, 
feet, 
and 
hair 
and 
expressed<p>
his
intention 
of 
making 
love 
to 
her. 
Anatole 
had 
no 
notion 
and 
was 
incapable
of 
considering 
what 
might 
come 
of 
such 
love-making, 
as 
he 
never 
had 
any
notion 
of 
the 
outcome 
of 
any 
of 
his 
actions.

"She's 
first-rate, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
but 
not 
for 
us," 
replied
Dolokhov.

"I 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hp2QJprO78hz.html">will</a> 
tell 
my 
sister 
to 
ask 
her 
to 
dinner," 
said 
Anatole.
"Eh?"

"You'd 
better 
wait 
till 
she's 
married...."

"You 
know, 
I 
adore 
little 
girls, 
they 
lose 
their 
heads 
at 
once,"
pursued 
Anatole.

"You 
have 
been 
caught 
once 
already 
by 
a 
'little 
girl,'" 
said
Dolokhov 
who 
knew 
of 
Kuragin's 
marriage. 
"Take 
care!"

"Well, 
that 
can't 
<a href="/cZl/LQ4Zd6C7FKLE.html">happen</a><p>
twice! 
Eh?" 
said 
Anatole, 
with 
a
good-humored 
laugh.





CHAPTER 
XII

The 
day 
after 
the 
opera 
the 
Rostovs 
went 
nowhere 
and 
nobody 
came 
to 
see
them. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
talked 
to 
the<p>
count 
about 
something 
which 
they
concealed 
from 
Natasha.<p>
Natasha 
guessed 
they 
were 
talking 
about 
the
old 
prince 
and 
planning 
something, 
and 
this 
disquieted 
and 
offended 
her.
She 
was 
expecting 
Prince 
Andrew 
any 
moment 
and 
twice 
that 
day 
sent 
a
manservant 
to 
the 
Vozdvizhenka 
to 
ascertain 
whether 
he 
had 
come. 
He 
had
not 
arrived. 
She 
suffered 
more 
now 
than 
during 
her 
first 
days 
in 
Moscow.

Natasha 
would 
have 
had 
no 
doubt 
as 
to 
the 
greatness 
of 
Pierre's 
idea,
but 
one 
thing 
disconcerted 
her.<p>
"Can 
a 
man 
so 
important 
and 
necessary 
to
society 
be 
also 
my 
husband? 
How 
did 
this 
happen?" 
She 
wished 
to 
express
this 
doubt 
to 
him. 
"Now 
who 
could 
decide 
whether 
he 
is 
really 
cleverer
than 
all 
the 
others?" 
she 
asked 
herself, 
and 
passed 
in 
review 
all 
those
whom 
Pierre 
most 
respected. 
Judging 
by 
what 
he 
had 
said 
there 
was 
no 
one
he 
had 
respected 
so 
highly 
as 
Platon 
Karataev.

"Do 
you 
know 
what 
I 
am 
thinking 
about?" 
she 
asked. 
"About 
Platon
Karataev. 
Would 
he 
have 
approved 
of 
you 
now, 
do 
you 
think?"

Pierre 
was 
not 
at 
all 
surprised 
at 
this 
question. 
He 
understood 
his
wife's 
line 
of 
thought.

"Platon 
Karataev?" 
he 
repeated, 
and 
pondered, 
evidently 
sincerely
trying 
to 
imagine 
Karataev's 
opinion 
on 
the 
subject. 
"He 
would 
not 
have
understood... 
yet 
perhaps 
he 
would."

"I 
love 
you 
awfully!" 
Natasha 
suddenly 
said. 
"Awfully, 
awfully!"

"No, 
he 
would 
not 
have 
approved," 
said 
Pierre, 
after 
reflection. 
"What
he 
would 
have 
approved 
of 
is 
our 
family 
life. 
He 
was 
always 
so 
anxious
to 
find 
seemliness, 
happiness, 
and 
peace 
in 
everything, 
and 
I 
should
have 
been 
proud 
to 
let 
him 
see 
us. 
There 
now-you 
talk 
of 
my 
absence,
but 
you

I

for

after

separation...."

"Yes, 
I 
should 
think..." 
Natasha 
began.

"No, 
it's 
not 
that. 
I 
never 
leave 
off 
loving 
you. 
And 
one 
couldn't 
love
more, 
but 
this 
is 
something 
special.... 
Yes, 
of 
course-" 
he 
did 
not
finish 
because 
their<p>
eyes 
meeting 
said 
the 
rest.

"What 
nonsense 
it 
is," 
Natasha 
suddenly 
exclaimed, 
"about 
honeymoons,
and 
that 
the 
greatest 
happiness 
is 
at 
first!<p>
On 
the 
contrary, 
now 
is
the 
best 
of 
all. 
If 
only 
you 
did 
not 
go 
away! 
Do 
you 
remember 
how
we 
quarreled? 
And 
it 
was 
always 
my 
fault. 
Always 
mine. 
And 
what 
we
quarreled 
about-I 
don't 
even 
remember!"

"Always 
about 
the 
same 
thing," 
said 
Pierre 
with 
a 
smile. 
"Jealo..."

"Don't 
say 
it!<p>
I 
can't 
bear 
it!" 
Natasha 
cried, 
and 
her 
eyes 
glittered
coldly 
and 
vindictively. 
"Did 
you 
see 
her?" 
she 
added, 
after 
a 
pause.

"No, 
and 
if 
I 
had 
I 
shouldn't 
have 
recognized 
her."

They 
were 
silent 
for 
a 
while.

"Oh, 
do 
you 
know? 
While 
you 
were 
talking 
in 
the 
study 
I 
was 
looking 
at
you," 
Natasha 
began, 
evidently 
anxious 
to 
disperse 
the 
cloud 
that 
had
come 
over 
them. 
"You 
are 
as 
like 
him 
as 
two 
peas-like 
the 
boy." 
(She
meant 
her 
little 
son.) 
"Oh, 
it's 
time 
to 
go 
to 
him.... 
The 
milk's
come.... 
But 
I'm 
sorry 
to 
leave 
you."

They 
were 
silent 
for 
a 
few 
seconds. 
Then 
suddenly 
turning 
to 
one
another 
at 
the 
same 
time 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/giG6iw9DduKC8i.html">they</a> 
both 
began 
to 
speak. 
Pierre 
began 
with
self-satisfaction 
and 
enthusiasm, 
Natasha 
with 
a 
quiet, 
happy 
smile.
Having 
interrupted 
one 
another 
they 
both 
stopped 
to 
let 
the 
other
continue.

"No. 
What 
did 
you 
say? 
Go 
on, 
go 
on."

"No, 
you 
go 
on, 
I 
was 
talking 
nonsense," 
said 
Natasha.

Pierre 
finished 
what 
he 
had 
begun. 
It 
was 
the 
sequel 
to 
his 
complacent
reflections 
on 
his 
success 
in 
Petersburg. 
At 
that 
moment 
it 
seemed 
to
him 
that 
he 
was 
chosen 
to 
give 
a 
new 
direction 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
Russian
society 
and 
to 
the 
whole 
world.

"I 
only 
wished 
to 
say 
that 
ideas 
that 
have 
great 
results 
are 
always
simple 
ones. 
My 
whole 
idea 
is 
that 
if 
vicious 
people 
are 
united 
and
constitute 
a 
power, 
then 
honest 
folk 
must 
do 
the 
same. 
Now 
that's 
simple
enough."

"Yes."

"And 
what 
were 
you 
going 
to 
say?"

"I? 
Only 
nonsense."

"But 
all 
the 
same?"

"Oh 
nothing, 
only 
a 
trifle," 
said 
Natasha, 
smiling 
still 
more 
brightly.
"I

Kutuzov 
felt</h1>and 
knew-not 
by 
reasoning 
or 
science 
but 
with 
the 
whole 
of
his 
Russian 
being-what 
every 
Russian 
soldier 
felt: 
that 
the 
French 
were
beaten, 
that 
the 
enemy 
was 
flying 
and<p>
must 
be 
driven 
out; 
but 
at 
the
same 
time 
he 
like 
the 
soldiers 
realized 
all 
the 
hardship 
of 
this 
march,
the 
rapidity 
of 
which 
was 
unparalleled 
for<p>
such 
a 
time 
of 
the 
year.

But 
to 
the 
generals, 
especially 
the 
foreign 
ones 
in 
the 
Russian 
army,
who 
wished 
to 
distinguish 
themselves, 
to 
astonish 
somebody, 
and 
for 
some
reason 
to 
capture 
a 
king 
or 
a 
duke-it 
seemed 
that 
now-when 
any 
battle
must 
be 
horrible 
and 
senseless-was 
the 
very 
time 
to 
fight 
and 
conquer
somebody. 
Kutuzov 
merely 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders 
when 
one 
after
another 
they 
presented 
projects 
of 
maneuvers 
to 
be 
made 
with 
those
soldiers-ill-shod, 
insufficiently 
clad, 
and 
half 
starved-who 
within 
a
month 
and 
without 
fighting 
a 
battle 
had 
dwindled 
to 
half 
their 
number,
and 
who 
at 
the 
best 
if 
the 
flight 
continued 
would 
have 
to 
go 
a<p>
greater
distance 
than 
they 
had 
already 
traversed, 
before 
they 
reached 
the
frontier.

This 
longing 
to 
distinguish 
themselves, 
to 
maneuver, 
to 
overthrow, 
and
to 
cut 
off 
showed 
itself 
particularly 
whenever 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UK9Z7Uo.html">Russians</a> 
stumbled 
on
the 
French 
army.

So 
it 
was 
at 
Krasnoe, 
where 
they 
expected 
to 
find 
one 
of 
the 
three
French 
columns 
and 
stumbled 
instead<p>
on 
Napoleon 
himself 
with 
sixteen
thousand 
men. 
Despite 
all 
Kutuzov's 
efforts 
to 
avoid 
that 
ruinous
encounter 
and 
to 
preserve 
his 
troops,<p>
the 
massacre 
of 
the 
broken 
mob
of 
French 
soldiers 
by 
worn-out 
Russians 
continued 
at 
Krasnoe 
for 
three
days.

Toll 
wrote 
a 
disposition: 
"The 
first 
column 
will 
march 
to 
so 
and 
so,"
etc. 
And 
as 
usual 
nothing 
happened<p>
in 
accord 
with 
the 
disposition.
Prince 
Eugene 
of 
Wuerttemberg 
fired 
from 
a 
hill 
over 
the 
French 
crowds
that 
were 
running 
past, 
and 
demanded 
reinforcements 
which 
did 
not
arrive. 
The 
French, 
avoiding 
the 
Russians, 
dispersed 
and 
hid 
themselves
in 
the 
forest 
by 
night, 
making 
their 
way 
round 
as 
best 
they 
could, 
and
continued 
their 
flight.

Miloradovich,

said 
he 
did 
not

anything 
about 
the
commissariat 
affairs

"I

he 
said, 
riding 
up 
to 
the 
troops 
and
pointing 
out 
the 
French 
to 
the 
cavalry.

And 
the 
cavalry, 
with 
spurs 
and 
sabers 
urging 
on 
horses 
that 
could

trotted 
with

The 
officers, 
who 
had 
come 
from 
the 
other 
sheds, 
were 
all 
strangers 
to
Pierre 
and 
much 
better 
dressed 
than 
he. 
They 
looked 
at 
him 
and 
at 
his
shoes 
mistrustfully, 
as 
at 
an 
alien. 
Not 
far 
from 
him 
walked 
a 
fat 
major
with 
a 
sallow, 
bloated, 
angry 
face, 
who 
was 
wearing 
a 
Kazan 
dressing
gown 
tied 
round 
with 
a 
towel, 
and 
who 
evidently 
enjoyed 
the 
respect 
of
his 
fellow 
prisoners. 
He 
kept 
one 
hand, 
in 
which 
he 
clasped 
his 
tobacco
pouch, 
inside 
the 
bosom 
of 
his 
dressing 
gown 
and 
held 
the 
stem 
of 
his
pipe 
firmly 
with 
the 
other. 
Panting 
and 
puffing, 
the 
major 
grumbled 
and
growled 
at 
everybody 
because 
he 
thought 
he 
was 
being 
pushed 
and 
that
they 
were 
all 
hurrying 
when 
they 
had 
nowhere 
to 
hurry 
to 
and 
were
all 
surprised 
at 
something 
when 
there 
was 
nothing 
to 
be 
surprised 
at.
Another, 
a 
thin 
little 
officer, 
was 
speaking 
to 
everyone, 
conjecturing
where 
they 
were 
now 
being 
taken 
and 
how 
far 
they 
would 
get 
that 
day. 
An
official 
in 
felt 
boots 
and 
wearing 
a 
commissariat 
uniform 
ran 
round 
from
side 
to 
side 
and 
gazed 
at 
the 
ruins 
of 
Moscow, 
loudly 
announcing 
his
observations 
as 
to 
what 
had 
been 
burned 
down 
and 
what 
this 
or 
that 
part
of 
the 
city 
was 
that 
they 
could 
see. 
A 
third 
officer, 
who 
by 
his 
accent
was 
a 
Pole, 
disputed 
with 
the 
commissariat 
officer, 
arguing 
that 
he 
was
mistaken 
in 
his 
identification 
of 
the 
different 
wards 
of 
Moscow.

"What 
are 
you 
disputing 
about?" 
said 
the 
major 
angrily. 
"What 
does 
it
matter 
whether 
it 
is 
St. 
Nicholas 
or 
St. 
Blasius? 
You 
see 
it's 
burned
down, 
and 
there's 
an 
end 
of 
it.... 
What 
are 
you 
pushing 
for? 
Isn't 
the
road 
wide 
enough?" 
said 
he, 
turning 
to 
a 
man 
behind 
him 
who 
was 
not
pushing 
him 
at 
all.

"Oh, 
oh, 
oh! 
What 
have 
they 
done?" 
the 
prisoners 
on 
one 
side 
and 
another
were 
heard 
saying 
as 
they 
gazed 
on 
the 
charred 
ruins. 
"All 
beyond 
the
river, 
and 
Zubova, 
and 
in 
the 
Kremlin.... 
Just 
look! 
There's 
not 
half 
of
it 
left. 
Yes, 
I 
told 
you-the 
whole 
quarter 
beyond 
the 
river, 
and 
so 
it
is."

"Well, 
you 
know 
it's 
burned, 
so 
what's 
the 
use 
of 
talking?" 
said 
the
major.

As 
they 
passed 
near 
a 
church 
in 
the 
Khamovniki 
(one 
of 
the 
few 
unburned
quarters 
of 
Moscow) 
the 
whole 
mass 
of 
prisoners 
suddenly 
started 
to 
one
side 
and 
exclamations 
of 
horror 
and 
disgust 
were 
heard.

"Ah, 
the 
villains! 
What 
heathens! 
Yes; 
dead, 
dead, 
so 
he 
is... 
And
smeared 
with 
something!"

Pierre 
too 
drew 
near 
the 
church 
where 
the 
thing 
was 
that 
evoked 
these
exclamations, 
and 
dimly 
made 
out 
something 
leaning 
against 
the 
palings
surrounding 
the 
church. 
From 
the 
words<p>
of 
his 
comrades 
who 
saw 
better
than 
he 
did, 
he 
found 
that 
this 
was 
the 
body 
of 
a 
man, 
set 
upright
against 
the 
palings 
with 
its 
face 
smeared 
with 
soot.

"Go 
on! 
What 
the 
devil... 
Go 
on! 
Thirty 
thousand 
devils!..." 
the 
convoy
guards 
began 
cursing 
and 
the 
French 
soldiers, 
with 
fresh 
virulence,
drove 
away 
with 
their 
swords 
the 
crowd 
of 
prisoners 
who 
were 
gazing 
at
the 
dead 
man.

possible 
only 
when

The 
historians 
consider 
that, 
next 
to 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino 
and 
the
occupation 
of 
Moscow 
by 
the 
enemy 
and 
its 
destruction 
by 
fire, 
the 
most
important 
episode 
of 
the 
war 
<a href="/cZl/aYs3Uo1yeL4.html">of</a> 
1812 
was 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
Russian
army 
from 
the 
Ryazana 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
and 
to 
the 
Tarutino 
camp-the
so-called 
flank 
march 
across 
the 
Krasnaya 
Pakhra 
River. 
<a href="/cZl/UxO6pSZHI5cLYU2qjYtS.html">They</a> 
ascribe 
the

and 
dispute 
as 
to
whom 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NIL9Xs90xR.html">honor</a> 
is 
due. 
Even 
foreign 
historians, 
including 
the 
French,
acknowledge 
the 
genius 
of 
the 
Russian 
commanders 
when 
they 
speak 
of
that 
flank 
march. 
But 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
understand 
why 
military 
writers,
and 
following 
them 
others, 
consider 
this 
flank 
march 
to 
be 
the 
profound
conception 
of 
some 
one 
man 
who 
saved 
Russia 
and 
destroyed 
Napoleon. 
In
the 
first 
place 
it 
is 
hard 
to 
understand 
where 
the 
profundity 
and 
genius
of 
this 
movement 
lay, 
for 
not 
much 
mental 
effort 
was 
needed 
to 
see 
that
the 
best 
position 
for 
an 
army 
when 
it 
is 
not 
being 
attacked 
is 
where
there 
are 
most 
provisions; 
and 
even 
a 
dull 
boy 
of 
thirteen 
could 
have
guessed 
that 
the 
best 
position 
for 
an 
army 
after 
its 
retreat 
from 
Moscow
in 
1812 
was 
on 
the 
Kaluga 
road. 
So 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
understand 
by
what 
reasoning 
the 
historians 
reach 
the 
conclusion 
that 
this 
maneuver
was 
a 
profound 
one. 
And 
it 
is 
even 
more 
difficult 
to 
understand 
just 
why
they 
think 
that 
this 
maneuver 
was 
calculated 
to 
save 
Russia 
and 
destroy

French;

in 
a 
battle. 
As 
long 
as
Nicholas 
alone 
was 
in 
danger 
the 
countess 
imagined 
that 
she 
loved 
her
first-born 
more 
than 
all 
her 
other 
children 
and 
even 
reproached 
herself
for 
it; 
but 
when 
her 
youngest: 
the 
scapegrace 
who 
had 
been 
bad 
at
lessons, 
was 
always 
breaking 
things 
in 
the 
house 
and 
making 
himself 
a
nuisance 
to 
everybody, 
that 
snub-nosed 
Petya 
with 
his 
merry 
black 
eyes
and 
fresh 
rosy 
cheeks 
where 
soft 
down 
was 
just 
beginning 
to 
show-when
he 
was 
thrown 
amid 
those 
big, 
dreadful, 
cruel 
men 
who 
were 
fighting
somewhere 
about 
something 
and 
apparently 
finding 
pleasure 
in 
it-then
his 
mother 
thought 
she 
loved 
him 
more,<p>
much 
more, 
than 
all 
her 
other
children. 
The 
nearer 
the 
time 
came 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jc5dK2tvJE4FKLE.html">for</a> 
Petya 
to 
return, 
the 
more 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wk68gle0TkvQH.html">uneasy
grew</a> 
the 
countess. 
She 
began 
to 
think 
she 
would 
never 
live 
to 
see 
such
happiness. 
The 
presence 
of 
Sonya, 
of 
her 
beloved 
Natasha, 
or 
even 
of
her 
husband 
irritated 
her. 
"What 
do 
I 
want 
with 
them? 
I 
want<p>
no 
one 
but
Petya," 
she 
thought.

At 
the 
end 
of 
August 
the 
Rostovs 
received 
another 
letter 
from 
<a href="/cZl/lx79pDix5pbE.html">Nicholas.
He</a> 
wrote 
from 
the 
province<p>
of 
Voronezh 
where 
he 
had 
been 
sent 
to 
procure
remounts, 
but 
that 
letter 
did 
not 
set 
the 
countess 
at 
ease. 
Knowing 
that
one 
son 
was 
out 
of 
danger 
she 
became 
the 
more 
anxious 
about 
Petya.

Though 
by 
the 
twentieth 
of 
August 
nearly 
all 
the 
Rostovs' 
acquaintances
had 
left 
Moscow, 
and 
though 
everybody 
tried 
to 
persuade 
the 
countess 
to
get 
away 
as 
quickly<p>
as 
possible, 
she 
would 
not 
hear 
of 
leaving 
before
her 
treasure, 
her 
adored 
Petya, 
returned. 
On 
the 
twenty-eighth 
of 
August
he 
arrived. 
The 
passionate 
tenderness 
with 
which 
his 
mother 
received 
him
did 
not 
please 
the 
sixteen-year-old 
officer. 
Though 
she 
concealed 
from
him 
her 
intention 
of 
keeping 
him 
under 
her 
wing, 
Petya 
guessed 
her
designs, 
and 
instinctively 
fearing 
that 
he 
might 
give 
way 
to 
emotion
when 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Br2GaVr7Ta0.html">with</a> 
her-might 
"become 
womanish" 
as 
he 
termed 
it 
to 
himself-he
treated 
her 
coldly, 
avoided 
her, 
and 
during 
his 
stay 
in 
Moscow 
attached
himself 
exclusively 
to 
Natasha 
for 
whom 
he 
had 
always 
had 
a 
particularly
brotherly 
tenderness, 
almost 
lover-like.

workmen 
whom
misfortune

from 
the<p>

Tranquillity

Your

no

among 
you 
his 
enemy

He

your

Respond, 
therefore,

work, 
your 
houses, 
your 
shops,

the 
protection

You 
shall

proper 
pay
for 
your

And

the
city 
where<p>
peasants 
can 
bring 
their 
surplus 
supplies 
and 
the 
products

soil. 
The 
government 
has 
taken<p>
the 
following 
steps

freedom

(1) 
From

peasants, 
husbandmen,

those
living 
in 
the 
neighborhood 
of 
Moscow 
may 
without 
any

their
supplies 
of 
all 
kinds 
to 
two 
appointed 
markets, 
of 
which 
one 
is 
on
the 
Mokhovaya 
Street 
and 
the 
other 
at 
the 
Provision 
Market. 
(2) 
Such
supplies 
will 
be 
bought 
from 
them 
at 
such 
prices 
as 
seller 
and 
buyer 
may
agree 
on, 
and 
if 
a 
seller 
is 
unable 
to 
obtain 
a 
fair 
price 
he 
will 
be
free 
to 
take 
his 
goods 
back 
to 
his 
village 
and 
no 
one 
may 
hinder 
him
under 
any 
pretense. 
(3) 
Sunday 
and 
Wednesday 
of 
each 
week 
are 
appointed
as 
the 
chief 
market 
days 
and 
to 
that 
end 
a 
sufficient 
number 
of 
troops
will 
be 
stationed 
along 
the 
highroads 
on 
Tuesdays 
and 
Saturdays 
at 
such
distances 
from 
the 
town 
as 
to 
protect 
the 
carts. 
(4) 
Similar 
measures
will 
be 
taken 
that 
peasants 
with 
their 
carts 
and 
horses 
may 
meet 
with 
no
hindrance 
on 
their 
return 
journey. 
(5) 
Steps 
will 
immediately 
be 
taken
to 
re-establish 
ordinary 
trading.

of 
the 
city 
and 
villages, 
and 
you, 
workingmen 
and 
artisans,
to

nation 
you 
belong,

and 
essential</h1>significance 
of 
the 
European 
events 
of 
the
beginning 
of 
the 
nineteenth 
century 
lies 
in 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
mass 
of
the 
European 
peoples 
from 
west 
to 
east 
and 
afterwards 
from 
east 
to 
west.
The 
commencement 
of 
that 
movement 
was 
the 
movement 
from 
west 
to 
east.
For 
the 
peoples 
of 
the 
west 
to 
be 
able 
to 
make 
their 
warlike 
movement
to<p>
Moscow 
it 
was 
necessary: 
(1) 
that 
they 
should 
form 
themselves 
into
a 
military 
group 
of 
a 
size 
able 
to 
endure 
a 
collision 
with 
the 
warlike
military 
group 
of 
the 
east, 
(2) 
that 
they 
should 
abandon 
all 
established
traditions 
and 
customs, 
and 
(3) 
that 
during 
their 
military 
movement 
they
should 
have 
at 
their 
head 
a 
man 
who 
could 
justify 
to 
himself 
and 
to 
them
the 
deceptions, 
robberies, 
and 
murders 
which 
would 
have 
to 
be 
committed
during 
that 
movement.

And 
beginning 
with 
the 
French 
Revolution 
the 
old 
inadequately 
large
group 
was 
destroyed, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
old 
habits 
and 
traditions, 
and 
step
by 
step 
a 
group 
was 
formed 
of 
larger 
dimensions 
with 
new 
customs 
and
traditions, 
and 
a 
man 
was 
produced 
who<p>
would 
stand 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the
coming 
movement 
and 
bear 
the 
responsibility 
for 
all 
that 
had 
to 
be 
done.

A 
man 
without 
convictions, 
without 
habits, 
without 
traditions, 
without
a 
name, 
and 
not 
even 
a 
Frenchman, 
emerges-by 
what 
seem 
the 
strangest
chances-from 
among 
all 
the 
seething 
French 
parties, 
and 
without 
joining
any 
one 
of 
them 
is 
borne 
forward 
to 
a 
prominent 
position.

The 
ignorance 
of 
his 
colleagues, 
the 
weakness 
and 
insignificance 
of
his 
opponents, 
the 
frankness 
of 
his 
falsehoods, 
and 
the 
dazzling 
and
self-confident 
limitations 
of 
this 
man 
raise 
him 
to 
the 
head 
of 
the
army. 
The 
brilliant 
qualities 
of 
the 
soldiers 
of 
the 
army 
sent 
to 
Italy,
his 
opponents' 
reluctance 
to 
fight, 
and 
his 
own 
childish 
audacity 
and
self-confidence 
secure 
him 
military 
fame. 
Innumerable 
so-called 
chances
accompany 
him 
everywhere. 
The 
disfavor 
into 
which 
he 
falls 
with 
the
rulers 
of 
France 
turns 
to 
his 
advantage. 
His 
attempts 
to 
avoid 
his
predestined 
path 
are 
unsuccessful: 
he 
is 
not 
received 
into 
the 
Russian
service, 
and 
the 
appointment 
he 
seeks 
in 
Turkey 
comes 
to 
nothing. 
During
the 
war 
in 
Italy 
he<p>
is 
several 
times 
on 
the 
verge 
of 
destruction 
and
each 
time 
is 
saved 
in 
an 
unexpected 
manner. 
Owing 
to 
various 
diplomatic
considerations 
the 
Russian 
armies-just 
those 
which 
might 
have 
destroyed
his 
prestige-do 
not 
appear 
upon 
the 
scene 
till 
he 
is 
no 
longer 
there.

On 
his 
return 
from 
Italy 
he 
finds 
the 
government 
in 
Paris 
in 
a 
process
of 
dissolution 
in 
which 
all 
those 
who 
are 
in 
it 
are 
inevitably 
wiped
out 
and<p>
destroyed. 
And 
by 
chance 
an 
escape 
from 
this 
dangerous 
position
presents 
itself 
in 
the 
form 
of 
an 
aimless 
and 
senseless 
expedition
to 
Africa. 
Again 
so-called 
chance 
accompanies 
him. 
Impregnable 
Malta
surrenders 
without 
a 
shot; 
his 
most 
reckless 
schemes 
are 
crowned 
with
success. 
The 
enemy's 
fleet, 
which 
subsequently 
did 
not 
let 
a 
single 
boat
pass, 
allows 
his 
entire 
army 
to 
elude 
it. 
In 
Africa 
a<p>
whole 
series 
of
outrages 
are 
committed 
against 
the 
almost 
unarmed 
inhabitants. 
And 
the
men 
who 
commit 
these 
crimes, 
especially 
their 
leader, 
assure 
themselves
that 
this 
is 
admirable, 
this 
is 
glory-it 
resembles 
Caesar 
and 
Alexander
the 
Great 
and 
is 
therefore 
good.

This 
ideal 
of 
glory 
and 
grandeur-which 
consists 
not 
merely 
in
considering 
nothing 
wrong 
that 
one 
does

a 
very 
clever 
woman. 
Had

to 
extricate 
herself 
from

she 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/PX8PUEsy69.html">would</a>

by 
acknowledging

But 
Helene, 
like 
a 
really 
great 
man 
who 
can 
do 
whatever
he 
pleases,<p>
at 
once 
assumed 
her 
own

to 
be 
correct, 
as 
she
sincerely 
believed 
it 
to 
be, 
and 
that 
everyone 
else 
was 
to 
blame.

The 
first 
time 
the 
young 
foreigner 
allowed 
himself 
to 
reproach 
her, 
she
lifted 
her 
beautiful 
head 
and, 
half 
turning 
to 
him, 
said 
firmly: 
"That's
just 
like 
a 
man-selfish 
and 
cruel! 
I 
expected 
nothing 
else. 
A 
woman
sacrifices 
herself 
for 
you, 
she 
suffers, 
and 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/TSZ5Y8vVJZj3.html">this</a> 
is 
her 
reward! 
What
right 
have

an

my 
attachments 
and
friendships? 
He 
is 
a 
man 
who 
has 
been 
more 
than 
a 
father 
to 
me!" 
The
prince 
was 
about 
to 
say 
something, 
but 
Helene 
interrupted 
him.

"Well, 
yes," 
said 
she, 
"it 
may 
be 
that 
he 
has 
other 
sentiments 
for 
me
than 
those 
of 
a 
father, 
but 
that 
is 
not 
a

for 
me 
to 
shut 
my 
door
on 
him. 
I 
am 
not 
a

that 
I 
should

kindness 
with 
ingratitude!
Know, 
monseigneur, 
that 
in 
all 
that 
relates 
to 
my 
intimate 
feelings 
I
render 
account 
only 
to 
God 
and 
to 
my 
conscience," 
she 
concluded, 
laying
her 
hand 
on 
her 
beautiful, 
fully 
expanded 
bosom 
and 
looking 
up 
to
heaven.

"But 
for 
heaven's 
sake 
listen 
to 
me!"

"Marry 
me, 
and 
I 
will 
be 
your 
slave!"

"But 
that's 
impossible."

"You 
won't 
deign 
<a href="/cZl/rP5vE4Gj3M.html">to</a> 
demean 
yourself 
by 
marrying 
me, 
you..." 
said 
Helene,
beginning 
to 
cry.

The 
prince 
tried 
to 
comfort 
her, 
but 
Helene, 
as 
if 
quite 
distraught,
said 
through 
her 
tears 
that 
there 
was 
nothing 
to 
prevent 
her 
marrying,
that 
there 
were 
precedents 
(there 
were 
up 
to 
that 
time 
very 
few, 
but
she 
mentioned 
Napoleon 
and 
some 
other 
exalted 
personages), 
that 
she 
had
never 
been 
her 
husband's 
wife, 
and 
that 
she 
had 
been 
sacrificed.

"But 
the 
law, 
religion..." 
said 
the 
prince, 
already 
yielding.

"The 
law, 
religion... 
What 
have 
they 
been 
invented 
for 
if<p>
they 
can't
arrange 
that?" 
said 
Helene.

The 
prince 
was 
surprised 
that 
so 
simple 
<a href="/aVzUge/qi4V4ieowf1.html">an</a> 
idea 
had 
not

he 
was

Helene 
was 
touched, 
and 
more 
than 
once 
tears 
rose 
to 
her 
eyes
and 
to 
those 
of 
Monsieur 
de 
Jobert 
and 
their 
voices 
trembled. 
A 
dance,
for

to

her,

an

The

A 
week 
after

a 
letter 
from 
Kutuzov 
informing 
the

of 
the 
fate 
that 
had

"Your

Kutuzov, 
"fell

Petya,

A 
few 
days 
before 
his 
departure 
a 
special 
thanksgiving, 
at 
which
Nicholas 
was 
present, 
was 
held 
in 
the 
cathedral 
for 
the 
Russian 
victory.
He 
stood 
a 
little 
behind 
the 
governor 
<a href="/cZl/XT9mDKi0HwD5ogArh.html">and</a> 
held 
himself 
with 
military
decorum 
through 
the 
service, 
meditating 
on 
a 
great 
variety 
of 
subjects.
When 
the 
service 
was 
over 
the 
governor's 
wife 
beckoned 
him 
to 
her.

"Have 
you 
seen 
the 
princess?" 
she 
asked,<p>
indicating 
with 
a 
movement 
of
her 
head 
a 
lady 
standing 
on 
the 
opposite 
side, 
beyond 
the 
choir.

Nicholas 
immediately 
recognized 
Princess 
Mary 
not 
so 
much 
by 
the 
profile
he 
saw 
under 
her 
bonnet 
as 
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
solicitude, 
timidity, 
and
pity 
that 
immediately 
overcame 
him. 
Princess 
Mary, 
evidently 
engrossed
by 
her 
thoughts, 
was 
crossing 
herself 
for 
the 
last 
time 
before 
leaving
the 
church.

Nicholas 
looked 
at 
her 
face 
with 
surprise. 
It 
was 
the 
same 
face 
he 
had
seen 
before, 
there 
was 
the 
same 
general 
expression 
of 
refined, 
inner,
spiritual 
labor, 
but 
now 
it 
was 
quite 
differently 
lit 
up. 
There 
was 
a
pathetic 
expression 
of 
sorrow, 
prayer, 
and 
hope 
in 
it. 
As 
had 
occurred
before 
when 
she 
was 
present, 
Nicholas 
went 
up

her 
without 
waiting 
to
be 
prompted 
by 
the 
governor's 
wife 
and 
not 
asking 
himself 
whether 
or 
not
it 
was 
right 
and 
proper 
to 
address 
her 
here 
in 
church, 
and 
told 
her 
he
had 
heard 
of 
her 
trouble 
and 
sympathized 
with 
his 
whole 
soul. 
As 
soon 
as
she 
heard 
his 
voice 
a 
vivid 
glow 
kindled 
in 
her 
face, 
lighting 
up 
both
her 
sorrow 
and 
her 
joy.

"There 
is 
one 
thing 
I 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you, 
Princess," 
said 
Rostov. 
"It
is 
that 
if 
your 
brother, 
Prince 
Andrew 
Nikolaevich, 
were 
not 
living, 
it
would 
have 
been 
at 
once 
announced 
in 
the 
Gazette, 
as 
he 
is 
a 
colonel."

The 
princess 
looked 
at 
him, 
not<p>
grasping 
what 
he 
was 
saying, 
but 
cheered
by 
the 
expression 
of 
regretful 
sympathy 
on 
his 
face.

"And 
I 
have 
known 
so 
many 
cases 
of 
a 
splinter 
wound" 
(the 
Gazette 
said
it 
was 
a 
shell) 
"either 
proving 
fatal 
at 
once 
or 
being 
very 
slight,"
continued 
Nicholas. 
"We 
must 
hope 
for 
the 
best, 
and 
I 
am 
sure..."

Princess 
Mary 
interrupted 
him.

"Oh, 
that 
would 
be 
so 
dread..." 
she 
began 
and, 
prevented 
by 
agitation
from 
finishing, 
she 
bent 
her 
head 
with 
a 
movement 
as 
graceful 
as
everything 
she 
did 
in 
his 
presence 
and, 
looking 
up 
at 
him 
gratefully,
went 
out, 
following 
her 
aunt.

That 
evening 
Nicholas 
did 
not 
go 
out, 
but 
stayed 
at 
home 
to 
settle 
some
accounts 
with 
the 
horse 
dealers. 
When 
he 
had 
finished 
that 
business 
it
was 
already 
too 
late 
to 
go 
anywhere 
but 
<a href="/aVzUge/FX2fkk9UHdX9ZUI.html">still</a> 
too 
early 
to 
go 
to 
bed,
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
he 
paced 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room, 
reflecting 
on 
his
life, 
a 
thing 
he 
rarely 
did.

Princess 
Mary 
had 
made 
an

impression 
on 
him 
when 
he 
had 
met
her 
in 
Smolensk

His

in 
such 
exceptional

Uncle

Natasha 
wailed 
in 
an 
imploring 
tone 
as 
if 
her
life 
depended 
on 
it.

"Uncle" 
rose, 
and 
it 
was 
as 
if 
there 
were 
two 
men 
in 
him: 
one 
of
them 
smiled 
seriously 
at 
the 
merry 
fellow, 
while 
the 
merry 
fellow 
struck
a 
naive 
and 
precise 
attitude 
preparatory 
to 
a 
folk 
dance.

"Now 
then, 
niece!" 
he 
exclaimed, 
waving 
to 
Natasha 
the<p>
hand 
that
had 
just 
struck 
a 
chord.

Natasha 
threw 
off 
the 
shawl 
from

shoulders, 
ran 
forward 
to 
face
"Uncle," 
and 
setting 
her 
arms 
akimbo 
also 
made 
a 
motion 
with 
her

struck 
an

As

At 
the

all 
halted, 
waiting 
for 
those 
in 
front 
to 
get 
across.
From 
the 
bridge 
they 
had 
a 
view 
of 
endless 
lines 
of 
moving 
baggage
trains 
before 
and 
behind 
them. 
To 
the 
right, 
where 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
turns
near 
Neskuchny, 
endless 
rows 
of 
troops 
and 
carts 
stretched 
away 
into
the 
distance. 
These 
were 
troops 
of 
Beauharnais' 
corps 
which 
had 
started
before 
any 
of 
the 
others. 
Behind, 
along 
the 
riverside 
and 
across 
the
Stone 
Bridge, 
were 
Ney's 
troops 
and 
transport.

Davout's 
troops, 
in 
whose 
charge 
were 
the 
prisoners, 
were 
crossing 
the
Crimean 
bridge 
and 
some 
were 
already 
debouching 
into 
the 
Kaluga 
road.
But<p>
the 
baggage 
trains 
stretched 
out 
so 
that 
the 
last 
of 
Beauharnais'
train 
had 
not 
yet 
got 
out 
of 
Moscow 
and 
reached 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
when
the 
vanguard 
of 
Ney's 
army 
was 
already 
emerging 
from 
the 
Great 
Ordynka
Street.

When 
they 
had 
crossed 
the 
<a href="/cZl/ml75ReoD3VEt.html">Crimean</a> 
bridge 
the 
prisoners 
moved 
a 
few 
steps
forward, 
halted, 
and 
again 
moved 
on, 
and 
from 
all 
sides 
vehicles 
and 
men
crowded 
closer 
and 
closer 
together. 
They 
advanced 
the 
few 
hundred 
paces
that 
separated 
the 
bridge 
from 
the 
Kaluga 
road, 
taking 
more 
than 
an
hour 
to 
do 
so, 
and 
came 
out 
<a href="/aVzUge/tL2tEu0fLYk9W.html">upon</a> 
the 
square 
where 
the 
streets 
of 
the
Transmoskva 
ward 
and 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
converge, 
and 
the 
prisoners 
jammed
close 
together 
had 
to 
stand 
for 
some 
hours 
at 
that 
crossway. 
From 
all
sides, 
like 
the 
roar 
of 
the 
sea, 
were 
heard 
the 
rattle 
of 
wheels, 
the
tramp 
of 
feet, 
and 
incessant 
shouts 
of 
anger 
and 
abuse. 
Pierre 
stood
pressed 
against 
the 
wall 
of 
a 
charred 
house, 
listening 
to 
that 
noise
which<p>
mingled 
in 
his 
imagination 
with 
the 
roll 
of 
the 
drums.

To 
get 
a 
better 
view, 
several 
officer 
prisoners 
climbed 
onto 
the 
wall 
of
the 
half-burned 
house 
against 
which 
Pierre 
was 
leaning.

"What 
crowds! 
Just 
look 
at 
the 
crowds!... 
They've 
loaded 
goods 
even 
on
the 
cannon! 
Look 
there, 
those 
are 
furs!" 
they 
exclaimed. 
"Just 
see 
what
the 
blackguards 
have 
looted.... 
There! 
See 
what 
that 
one 
has 
behind
in 
the 
cart.... 
Why, 
those 
are 
settings 
taken 
from 
some 
icons, 
by
heaven!... 
Oh, 
the 
rascals!... 
See 
how 
that 
fellow 
has 
loaded
himself 
up, 
he 
can 
hardly 
walk! 
Good 
lord, 
they've 
even 
grabbed 
those
chaises!... 
See 
that 
fellow 
there 
sitting 
on 
the 
trunks.... 
Heavens!
They're 
fighting."

"That's 
right, 
hit 
him 
on 
the 
snout-on 
his 
snout! 
Like 
this, 
we
shan't 
get 
away 
before 
evening. 
Look, 
look 
there.... 
Why, 
that 
must 
be
Napoleon's 
own. 
See 
what 
horses! 
And 
the 
monograms 
with 
a 
crown! 
It's
like 
a 
portable 
house.... 
That 
fellow's 
dropped 
his 
sack 
and 
doesn't 
see
it. 
Fighting 
again... 
A 
woman 
with 
a 
baby, 
and 
not 
bad-looking 
either!
Yes, 
I 
dare 
say, 
that's 
the 
way 
they'll 
let 
you 
pass.... 
Just 
look,
there's 
no 
end 
to 
it. 
Russian 
wenches, 
by 
heaven, 
so 
they 
are! 
In
carriages-see 
how 
comfortably 
they've 
settled 
themselves!"

Again, 
as 
at 
the 
church 
in 
Khamovniki,<p>
a 
wave 
of 
general 
curiosity
bore 
all 
the 
prisoners 
forward 
onto 
the 
road, 
and 
Pierre, 
thanks 
to
his 
stature, 
saw 
over 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
others 
what 
so 
attracted 
their
curiosity. 
In 
three 
carriages 
involved 
among 
the 
munition 
carts, 
closely
squeezed 
together, 
sat 
women 
with 
rouged 
faces, 
dressed 
in 
glaring
colors, 
who 
were 
shouting 
something 
in 
shrill 
voices.

From 
the 
moment 
Pierre 
had 
recognized 
the 
appearance 
of 
the 
mysterious
force 
nothing 
had 
seemed 
to 
him 
strange 
or 
dreadful: 
neither 
the 
corpse
smeared 
with 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Eh7mSaQt9Scb9.html">soot</a> 
for 
fun 
nor 
these 
women 
hurrying 
away 
nor 
the 
burned
ruins 
of 
Moscow. 
All 
that 
he 
now 
witnessed 
scarcely 
made 
an 
impression
on 
him-as 
if 
his 
soul, 
making 
ready 
for 
a 
hard 
struggle, 
refused 
to
receive 
impressions 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qr1Kzb7vGF4NbF.html">that</a>

He

pure

poetic 
that
my

him, 
transient 
as 
they 
were, 
have 
been 
one 
of 
the
sweetest 
comforts 
to 
my 
poor 
heart, 
which 
has 
already 
suffered 
so 
much.
Someday 
I 
will 
tell 
you 
about 
our 
parting 
and 
all 
that 
was 
said 
then.
That 
is 
still 
too 
fresh. 
Ah, 
dear 
friend, 
you 
are 
happy 
not 
to 
know
these 
poignant 
joys 
and 
sorrows. 
You 
are 
fortunate, 
for 
the 
latter 
are
generally 
the 
stronger! 
I 
know 
very 
well 
that 
Count 
Nicholas 
is 
too
young 
ever 
to 
be 
more 
to 
me 
than 
a 
friend, 
but 
this 
sweet 
friendship,
this 
poetic 
and 
pure 
intimacy, 
were 
what 
my 
heart 
needed. 
But 
enough 
of
this! 
The 
chief 
news, 
about 
which 
all 
Moscow 
gossips, 
is 
the 
death 
of
old 
Count 
Bezukhov, 
and 
his 
inheritance. 
Fancy! 
The 
three 
princesses
have 
received 
very 
little, 
Prince 
Vasili 
nothing, 
and 
it 
is 
Monsieur
Pierre 
who 
has 
inherited 
all 
the 
property 
and 
has 
besides 
been
recognized 
as 
legitimate; 
so 
that 
he 
is 
now 
Count 
Bezukhov 
and
possessor 
of 
the 
finest 
fortune 
in 
Russia. 
It 
is 
rumored 
that 
Prince
Vasili 
played 
a 
very 
despicable 
part 
in 
this 
affair 
and 
that 
he
returned 
to 
Petersburg 
quite 
crestfallen.

I 
confess 
I 
understand 
very 
little 
about 
all 
these 
matters 
of 
wills 
and
inheritance; 
but 
I 
do 
know 
that 
since 
this 
young 
man, 
whom 
we 
all 
used
to 
know 
as 
plain 
Monsieur 
Pierre, 
has 
become 
Count 
Bezukhov 
and 
the
owner 
of 
one 
of 
the 
largest 
fortunes 
in 
Russia, 
I 
am 
much 
amused 
to
watch 
the 
change 
in 
the 
tone 
and 
manners 
of 
the 
mammas 
burdened 
by
marriageable 
daughters, 
and 
of 
the 
young 
ladies 
themselves, 
toward
him, 
though, 
between 
you 
and 
me, 
he 
always 
seemed 
to 
me 
a 
poor 
sort
of 
fellow. 
As 
for 
the 
past 
two 
years 
people 
have 
amused 
themselves
by 
finding 
husbands 
for 
me 
(most 
of<p>
whom 
I 
don't 
even 
know), 
the
matchmaking 
chronicles 
of 
Moscow 
now 
speak 
of 
me 
as 
the 
future 
Countess
Bezukhova. 
But 
you 
will 
understand 
that 
I 
have 
no 
desire 
for 
the 
post.

to
the

and 
took 
up 
the

Anatole 
brought 
two 
candles 
and
placed 
them 
on 
the 
window 
sill, 
though 
it 
was 
already 
quite 
light.
Dolokhov's 
back 
in 
his 
white 
shirt, 
and 
his 
curly 
head, 
were 
lit
up 
from 
both 
sides. 
Everyone 
crowded 
to 
the 
window,<p>
the 
Englishman 
in
front. 
Pierre 
stood 
smiling 
but 
silent. 
One 
man, 
older 
than 
the 
others
present, 
suddenly 
pushed 
forward 
with 
a 
scared 
and 
angry 
look 
and 
wanted
to 
seize 
hold 
of 
Dolokhov's 
shirt.

"I 
say, 
this 
is 
folly! 
He'll 
be 
killed," 
said 
this 
more 
sensible
man.

Anatole 
stopped 
him.

"Don't 
touch 
him! 
You'll 
startle 
him 
and 
then 
he'll 
be 
killed.
Eh?... 
What 
then?... 
Eh?"

Dolokhov 
turned 
round 
and, 
again 
holding 
on 
with 
both 
hands, 
arranged
himself 
on 
his 
seat.

"If 
anyone 
comes 
meddling 
again," 
said 
he, 
emitting 
the 
words
separately 
through 
his 
thin 
compressed 
lips, 
"I 
will 
throw 
him 
down
there. 
Now 
then!"

Saying 
this 
he 
again 
turned 
round, 
dropped 
his 
hands, 
took 
the 
bottle
and 
lifted 
it 
to 
his 
lips, 
threw 
back 
his 
head, 
and 
raised 
his 
free 
hand
to 
balance 
himself.

CHAPTER 
X

On 
the 
thirtieth 
of 
August 
Pierre 
reached 
Moscow. 
Close 
to 
the 
gates 
of
the 
city 
he 
was 
met 
by 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
adjutant.

"We 
have 
been 
looking 
for 
you 
everywhere," 
said 
the 
adjutant. 
"The 
count
wants 
to 
see 
you 
particularly. 
He 
asks 
you 
to 
come 
to 
him 
at 
once 
on 
a
very 
important 
matter."

Without 
going 
home, 
Pierre 
took 
a 
cab 
and 
drove 
<a href="/aVzUge/cF9JCLL4k6.html">to</a> 
see 
the 
Moscow
commander 
in

Count 
Rostopchin 
had 
only 
that 
morning 
returned 
to 
town 
from 
his 
summer
villa 
at 
Sokolniki. 
The 
anteroom 
and 
reception

house

full 
of

"No,

Pierre.





CHAPTER 
XII

In 
the 
evening 
Andrew 
and 
Pierre 
got 
into 
the 
open 
carriage 
and 
drove 
to
Bald 
Hills. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
glancing 
at 
Pierre, 
broke 
the 
silence 
now 
and
then 
with 
remarks 
which 
showed 
that 
he 
was 
in 
a 
good 
temper.

Pointing 
to 
the 
fields, 
he 
spoke 
of 
the 
improvements 
he 
was 
making 
in
his 
husbandry.

Pierre 
remained 
gloomily 
silent, 
answering 
in 
monosyllables 
and
apparently 
immersed 
in 
his 
own 
thoughts.

He 
was 
thinking 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
unhappy, 
had 
gone 
astray, 
did 
not
see 
the 
true 
light, 
and 
that 
he, 
Pierre, 
ought 
to 
aid, 
enlighten, 
and
raise 
him. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
thought 
of 
what 
he 
should 
say, 
he 
felt 
that
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
one 
word, 
one 
argument, 
would 
upset 
all 
his 
teaching,
and 
he 
shrank 
from 
beginning, 
afraid 
of 
exposing 
to 
possible 
ridicule
what 
to 
him 
was 
precious 
and 
sacred.

"No, 
but 
why 
do 
you 
think 
so?" 
Pierre 
suddenly 
began, 
lowering 
his
head 
and 
looking 
like 
a 
bull 
about<p>
to 
charge, 
"why 
do 
you 
think 
so?
You 
should 
not 
think 
so."

"Think? 
What 
about?" 
asked 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
surprise.

"About 
life, 
about 
man's 
destiny. 
It 
can't 
be 
so. 
I 
myself 
thought
like 
that, 
and 
do 
you 
know 
what 
saved 
me? 
Freemasonry! 
No, 
don't
smile. 
Freemasonry 
is 
not 
a 
religious 
ceremonial 
sect, 
as 
I 
thought
it 
was: 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
best 
expression 
of 
the 
best, 
the 
eternal,
aspects 
of 
humanity."

And 
he 
began 
to 
explain 
Freemasonry 
as 
he 
understood 
it 
to 
Prince
Andrew. 
He 
said 
that 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
teaching 
of 
Christianity 
freed
from 
the 
bonds 
of 
State 
and 
Church, 
a 
teaching 
of 
equality, 
brotherhood,
and 
love.

"Only 
our 
holy 
brotherhood 
has 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
life, 
all 
the 
rest
is 
a 
dream," 
said 
Pierre. 
"Understand, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
that 
outside
this 
union 
all 
is 
filled 
with 
deceit 
and 
falsehood 
and 
I 
agree 
with 
you
that 
nothing 
is 
left 
for 
an 
intelligent 
and 
good 
man 
but 
to 
live 
out
his 
life, 
like 
you, 
merely 
trying 
not 
to 
harm 
others. 
But 
make 
our
fundamental 
convictions 
your 
own, 
join 
our 
brotherhood, 
give 
yourself 
up
to 
us, 
let 
yourself 
be 
guided, 
and 
you 
will 
at 
once 
feel 
yourself, 
as 
I
have 
felt 
myself, 
a 
part 
of 
that 
vast 
invisible 
chain 
the 
beginning 
of
which 
is<p>
hidden 
in 
heaven," 
said 
Pierre.

Andrew,

listened 
to

their 
remarks, 
but 
did 
not

in 
the 
conversations 
or 
express 
any

After 
hearing
what 
was 
being

by 
one 
or 
other 
of 
these 
groups 
he 
generally 
turned
away 
with 
an 
air 
of 
disappointment, 
as 
though 
they 
were 
not 
speaking 
of
anything 
he 
wished 
to 
hear. 
Some 
discussed 
the 
position<p>
that 
had 
been
chosen, 
criticizing 
not 
the 
position 
itself 
so 
much 
as 
the 
mental
capacity 
of 
those 
who 
had 
chosen 
it. 
Others 
argued 
that 
a 
mistake 
had
been 
made 
earlier 
and 
that 
a 
battle 
should 
have 
been 
fought 
two 
days
before. 
Others<p>
again 
spoke 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Salamanca, 
which 
was
described 
by 
Crosart, 
a 
newly 
arrived 
Frenchman 
in 
a 
Spanish 
uniform.
(This 
Frenchman 
and 
one 
of 
the 
German 
princes 
serving 
with 
the 
Russian
army 
were 
discussing 
the 
siege 
of 
Saragossa 
and 
considering 
the
possibility 
of 
defending 
Moscow 
in 
a 
similar 
manner.) 
Count 
Rostopchin
was 
telling 
a 
fourth 
group 
that 
he 
was 
prepared 
to 
die 
with 
the 
city
train 
bands 
under 
the 
walls 
of 
the 
capital, 
but 
that 
he 
still 
could 
not
help 
regretting 
having 
been 
left 
in 
ignorance 
of 
what 
was 
happening, 
and
that 
had 
he 
known 
it 
sooner 
things 
would 
have 
been 
different.... 
A
fifth 
group, 
displaying 
the 
profundity 
of 
their 
strategic 
perceptions,
discussed 
the 
direction 
the 
troops 
would 
now 
have 
to 
take. 
A 
sixth 
group
was 
talking 
absolute 
nonsense. 
Kutuzov's 
expression 
grew 
more 
and 
more
preoccupied 
and 
gloomy. 
From 
all<p>
this<p>
talk 
he 
saw 
only 
one 
thing: 
that
to 
defend 
Moscow 
was 
a 
physical

impossible 
that

It 
would 
not

because 
the

not 
merely 
all 
recognized 
the 
position 
to 
be 
impossible, 
but
in 
their 
conversations 
were 
only 
discussing 
what 
would 
happen 
after 
its
inevitable 
abandonment. 
How 
could 
the<p>
commanders 
lead 
their 
troops 
to
a 
field 
of 
battle 
they 
considered 
impossible 
to 
hold? 
The 
lower-grade
officers 
and<p>
even 
the 
soldiers 
(who

reason) 
also 
considered 
the
position 
impossible 
and 
therefore 
could 
not 
go 
to 
fight, 
fully 
convinced
as 
they 
were 
of 
defeat. 
If 
Bennigsen 
insisted 
on 
the 
position 
being
defended 
and 
others 
still 
discussed 
it, 
the 
question 
was 
no 
longer
important 
in 
itself 
but 
only 
as 
a 
pretext 
for 
disputes 
and 
intrigue.
This 
Kutuzov 
knew 
well.

Bennigsen, 
who 
had 
chosen 
the 
position, 
warmly 
displayed 
his 
Russian
patriotism 
(Kutuzov 
could 
not 
listen 
to 
this 
without 
wincing) 
by
insisting 
that 
Moscow 
must 
be<p>
defended. 
His 
aim 
was 
as 
clear 
as 
daylight
to 
Kutuzov: 
if 
the 
defense 
failed, 
to 
throw 
the 
blame 
on 
Kutuzov 
who 
had
brought 
the 
army 
as 
far 
as 
the 
Sparrow 
Hills 
without 
giving 
battle; 
if
it 
succeeded, 
to 
claim 
the 
success 
as 
his 
own; 
or<p>
if 
battle 
were 
not
given, 
to 
clear 
himself 
of 
the 
crime 
of 
abandoning 
Moscow.

this

who 
formerly 
reflected 
the 
movement 
of 
the

now 
reflected 
the 
restless 
movement 
by 
political
and 
diplomatic 
combinations, 
laws, 
and 
treaties.

The 
historians 
call 
this 
activity 
of 
the 
historical 
figures 
"the
reaction."

In 
dealing

this

sternly 
condemn 
the

in 
their 
opinion, 
caused 
what 
they 
describe 
as 
the

All 
the

of<p>
that 
period, 
from 
Alexander

Napoleon 
to 
Madame

are

to 
whether 
they 
conduced 
to

to 
reaction.

According 
to 
their 
accounts 
a 
reaction 
took 
place 
at 
that 
time 
in 
Russia
also, 
and 
the 
chief 
culprit 
was 
Alexander 
I, 
the 
same 
man 
who 
according
to 
them 
was 
the 
chief 
cause 
of 
the 
liberal 
movement 
at 
the 
commencement
of 
his 
reign, 
being 
the 
savior 
of 
Russia.

There 
is 
no

schoolboy

Alexander

he 
did

"He

In

he 
did
well

in 
that 
case 
badly. 
He 
behaved 
admirably 
at 
the 
beginning 
of
his 
reign 
and 
during 
1812, 
but 
acted 
badly 
by 
giving 
a 
constitution
to 
Poland, 
forming 
the 
Holy 
Alliance, 
entrusting

Arakcheev,

Golitsyn 
and

and 
afterwards 
<a href="/aVzUge/LE260zSr.html">Shishkov</a>

Photius.
He 
also 
acted

The

understood 
from

official 
report 
that 
our

had 
been
defeated. 
A 
week 
after 
the

of 
Austerlitz
came 
a 
letter 
from 
Kutuzov 
informing<p>
the

of 
the 
fate 
that 
had
befallen 
his 
son.

"Your

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/FKL39t5zvJ.html">wrote</a> 
Kutuzov, 
"fell

After 
receiving 
this 
news 
late 
in 
the 
evening, 
when 
he 
was 
alone 
in 
his
study, 
the 
old 
prince 
went 
for 
his 
walk 
as 
usual 
next 
morning, 
but 
he
was 
silent 
with 
his 
steward, 
the 
gardener, 
and 
the 
architect, 
and 
though
he 
looked 
very 
grim 
he 
said 
nothing 
to 
anyone.

When 
Princess 
Mary 
went 
to 
him 
at 
the 
usual<p>
hour 
he 
was 
working 
at 
his
lathe 
and, 
as 
usual, 
did 
not 
look 
round 
at 
her.

"Ah, 
Princess 
Mary!" 
he 
said 
suddenly 
in 
an 
unnatural 
voice,
throwing 
down 
his 
chisel. 
(The 
wheel 
continued 
to 
revolve 
by 
its

Princess

She 
approached 
him, 
saw 
his

something 
gave 
way 
within 
her. 
Her

grew 
dim. 
By

her

That

still
further 
strengthened

his

without

(which 
seemed

incomprehensible),
he 
appeared 
to 
them 
a

his 
disdain 
for 
the 
comforts 
of
life, 
his 
absent-mindedness 
and 
simplicity-here 
among 
these 
people 
gave
him 
almost 
the 
status 
of 
a 
hero. 
And 
Pierre 
felt 
that 
their

placed 
responsibilities 
upon 
him.





CHAPTER 
XIII

The 
French 
evacuation 
began 
on 
the 
night 
between 
the 
sixth 
and 
seventh
of 
October: 
kitchens 
and 
sheds<p>
were 
dismantled, 
carts 
loaded, 
and 
troops
and 
baggage 
trains 
started.

At 
seven 
in 
the 
morning 
a 
French 
convoy 
in 
marching 
trim, 
wearing 
shakos
and 
carrying 
muskets, 
knapsacks, 
and 
enormous 
sacks, 
stood 
in 
front
of 
the 
sheds, 
and 
animated 
French 
talk 
mingled 
with 
curses 
sounded 
all
along 
the 
lines.

In 
the 
shed 
everyone 
was 
ready, 
dressed, 
belted, 
shod, 
and 
only 
awaited
the 
order 
to 
start. 
The 
sick 
soldier, 
Sokolov, 
pale 
and 
thin 
with<p>
dark
shadows 
round 
his 
eyes, 
alone 
sat 
in<p>
his 
place<p>
barefoot 
and 
not 
dressed.
His 
eyes, 
prominent 
from 
the 
emaciation 
of 
his 
face, 
gazed 
inquiringly
at 
his 
comrades 
who 
were 
paying 
no 
attention 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
moaned
regularly 
and 
quietly. 
It 
was 
evidently 
not 
so 
much 
his 
sufferings 
that
caused 
him 
to 
moan 
(he 
had 
dysentery) 
as 
his 
fear 
and 
grief 
at 
being
left 
alone.

Pierre, 
girt<p>
with 
a 
rope 
round 
his 
waist 
and 
wearing 
shoes 
Karataev 
had
made 
for 
him 
from 
some 
leather 
a 
French 
soldier 
had 
torn 
off 
a 
tea 
chest
and 
brought 
to 
have 
his 
boots 
mended 
with, 
went 
up 
to 
the 
sick 
man 
and
squatted 
down 
beside 
him.

"You 
know, 
Sokolov, 
they 
are 
not 
all 
going 
away!<p>
They 
have 
a 
hospital
here. 
You 
may 
be<p>
better 
off 
than 
we 
others," 
said 
Pierre.

"O 
Lord! 
Oh, 
it 
will 
be 
the 
death 
of 
me! 
O 
Lord!" 
moaned 
the 
man 
in 
a
louder 
voice.

"I'll 
go 
and 
ask 
them 
again 
directly," 
said 
Pierre, 
rising 
and 
going 
to
the 
door 
of 
the 
shed.

Just

Pierre 
reached 
the 
door, 
the

Prince 
Vasili 
was 
seated 
in 
an 
easy 
chair 
in 
his 
familiar 
attitude,
with 
one 
leg 
crossed 
high 
above 
the 
other. 
His 
cheeks, 
which 
were 
so
flabby 
that 
they 
looked 
heavier 
below, 
were 
twitching 
violently; 
but
he 
wore 
the 
air 
of 
a<p>
man 
little 
concerned 
in 
what 
the 
two 
ladies 
were
saying.

"Come,

Anna 
Mikhaylovna,

Catiche

You

the 
younger 
of
the 
two 
ladies, 
addressing 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
pointing 
to 
an 
inlaid
portfolio 
she 
held 
in 
her 
hand. 
"All 
I 
know 
is 
that 
his 
real 
will 
is
in 
his 
writing 
table, 
and 
this 
is 
a 
paper 
he 
has

She 
tried 
to 
pass 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
but 
the 
latter 
sprang 
so 
as 
to 
bar
her 
path.

"I 
know, 
my 
dear, 
kind 
princess," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
seizing
the 
portfolio 
so 
firmly 
that 
it 
was 
plain 
she 
would 
not 
let 
go 
easily.
"Dear 
princess, 
I 
beg 
and 
implore 
you, 
have 
some 
pity 
on 
him!<p>
Je 
vous
en

The 
princess 
did 
not 
reply. 
Their 
efforts 
in 
the 
struggle 
for 
the
portfolio 
were 
the 
only 
sounds 
audible, 
but 
it 
was 
evident 
that 
if
the 
princess 
did 
speak, 
her 
words 
would 
not 
be 
flattering 
to 
Anna
Mikhaylovna. 
Though 
the 
latter

Pierre 
listened 
to

attentively

seriously. 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
out
of 
the

and 
then, 
leaving 
"God's

to 
finish 
their

Princess

took 
Pierre 
into 
the

"You

she 
said 
to

"Oh,

Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
him 
silently 
and 
smiled 
affectionately.

"I 
have 
known 
you 
a 
long 
time, 
you

and 
am 
as 
fond 
of 
you

she 
said. 
"How

you 
find 
Andrew?" 
she 
added 
hurriedly,
not 
giving 
him 
time 
to 
reply 
to 
her 
affectionate 
words. 
"I 
am 
very
anxious 
about 
him. 
His 
health 
was 
better 
in 
the 
winter, 
but 
last 
spring
his 
wound 
reopened 
and 
the 
doctor 
said 
he 
ought 
to 
go 
away 
for 
a
cure. 
And 
I 
am 
also 
very 
much 
afraid 
for 
him 
spiritually. 
He 
has 
not 
a
character 
like 
us 
women 
who, 
when 
we 
suffer, 
can 
weep 
away 
our 
sorrows.
He 
keeps 
it 
all 
within 
him. 
Today 
he 
is 
cheerful 
and 
in 
good 
spirits,
but 
that 
is 
the 
effect 
of 
your 
visit-he 
is 
not 
often 
like 
that. 
If
you 
could 
persuade 
him 
to 
go 
abroad. 
He 
needs 
activity, 
and 
this 
quiet
regular 
life 
is 
very 
bad 
for 
him. 
Others 
don't 
notice 
it, 
but 
I 
see
it."

Toward 
ten 
o'clock 
the 
men 
servants 
rushed 
to 
the 
front 
door, 
hearing
the 
bells 
of 
the 
old 
prince's 
carriage 
approaching. 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
Pierre 
also 
went 
out 
into 
the 
porch.

"Who's 
that?" 
asked 
the 
old 
prince, 
noticing 
Pierre 
as 
he<p>
got 
out
of 
the 
carriage.

"Ah! 
Very 
glad! 
Kiss 
me," 
he 
said, 
having 
learned 
who 
the 
young
stranger 
was.

The 
old 
prince 
was 
in 
a 
good 
temper 
and 
very 
gracious 
to 
Pierre.

Before 
supper, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
coming 
back 
to 
his 
father's 
study, 
found
him 
disputing 
hotly 
with 
his 
visitor. 
Pierre 
was 
maintaining 
that 
a 
time
would 
come 
when 
there 
would 
be 
no 
more 
wars. 
The 
old 
prince 
disputed 
it
chaffingly, 
but 
without 
getting 
angry.

"Drain 
<a href="/cZl/aK9AgW7Uo9.html">the</a> 
blood 
from 
men's 
veins 
and 
put 
in 
water 
instead,

there

Old 
women's 
nonsense-old 
women's
nonsense!" 
he 
repeated, 
but 
still 
he 
patted 
Pierre 
affectionately
on 
the 
shoulder, 
and 
then 
went 
up 
to 
the 
table 
where 
Prince 
Andrew,
evidently 
not 
wishing 
to 
join 
in 
the

was 
looking 
over 
<a href="/cZl/dA2tQI5SC4.html">the

had

from

The 
old<p>

went 
up 
to 
him
and 
began 
to 
talk 
business.

"The

So 
the

was 
happy 
that 
Pierre 
had
arrived.

The 
guests 
welcomed 
Pierre 
because 
he 
always 
helped 
to 
enliven 
and 
unite
any 
company 
he 
was 
in.

The 
grown-up 
members 
of 
the<p>
family, 
not 
to 
mention 
his 
wife, 
were
pleased 
to 
have 
back 
a 
friend 
whose 
presence 
made 
life 
run 
more 
smoothly
and 
peacefully.

The 
old 
ladies 
were 
pleased 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/sw5NSUp68mGGRm.html">with</a> 
the 
presents 
he 
brought 
them, 
and
especially 
that 
Natasha 
would 
now 
be 
herself 
again.

Pierre 
felt 
the 
different 
outlooks 
of 
these 
various 
worlds 
and 
made
haste 
to 
satisfy 
all 
their 
expectations.

Though 
the 
most 
absent-minded<p>
and 
forgetful 
of 
men, 
Pierre, 
with 
the 
aid
of 
a 
list 
his 
wife 
drew 
up, 
had 
now 
bought 
everything, 
not 
forgetting
his 
mother-and 
brother-in-law's 
commissions, 
nor 
the 
dress 
material 
for
a 
present 
to 
Belova, 
nor 
toys 
for 
his 
wife's 
nephews. 
In<p>
the 
early 
days
of 
his 
marriage 
it 
had 
seemed 
strange 
to 
him 
that 
his 
wife 
should 
expect
him 
not 
to 
forget 
to 
procure 
all 
the 
things 
he 
undertook 
to 
buy, 
and 
he
had 
been 
taken 
aback 
by 
her 
serious 
annoyance 
when 
on 
his 
first 
trip 
he
forgot 
everything. 
But 
in 
time 
he 
grew 
used 
to 
this 
demand. 
Knowing 
that
Natasha 
asked 
nothing 
for 
herself, 
and 
gave 
him 
commissions 
for 
others
only 
when 
he 
himself 
had 
offered 
to 
undertake 
them, 
he 
now 
found 
an
unexpected 
and 
childlike 
pleasure 
in 
this 
purchase 
of 
presents 
for
everyone 
in 
the 
house, 
and 
never 
forgot 
anything. 
If 
he 
now 
incurred
Natasha's 
censure 
it 
was 
only 
for 
buying 
too 
many 
and 
too 
expensive
things. 
To 
her 
other 
defects 
(as 
most 
people 
thought 
them, 
but 
which
to 
Pierre 
were 
qualities) 
of 
untidiness 
and 
neglect 
of 
herself, 
she 
now
added 
stinginess.

From 
the 
time 
that 
Pierre 
began 
life 
as 
a 
family 
man 
on 
a 
footing
entailing 
heavy 
expenditure, 
he 
had 
noticed 
to 
his 
surprise 
that 
he
spent 
only 
half 
as 
much 
as 
before, 
and 
that 
his 
affairs-which 
had 
been
in 
disorder 
of 
late, 
chiefly 
because 
of 
his 
first 
wife's 
debts-had 
begun
to 
improve.

Life 
was 
cheaper 
because 
it 
was 
circumscribed: 
that 
<a href="/cZl/Bx1t0Sdo6HQTp.html">most</a> 
expensive
luxury, 
the 
kind 
of 
life 
that 
can 
be 
changed 
at 
any 
moment, 
was 
no
longer 
his 
nor 
did 
he 
wish 
for 
it. 
He 
felt 
that 
his 
way 
of 
life 
had 
now
been 
settled 
once 
for 
all 
till 
death 
and 
that 
to 
change 
it 
was 
not 
in
his 
power, 
and 
so 
that 
way 
of 
life 
proved 
economical.

With 
a 
merry, 
smiling 
face 
Pierre 
was<p>
sorting 
his 
purchases.

"What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
this?" 
said 
he, 
unrolling 
a 
piece 
of 
stuff 
like 
a
shopman.

Natasha,<p>
who 
was 
sitting 
opposite 
to 
him 
with 
her 
eldest 
daughter 
on 
her
lap, 
turned 
her 
sparkling 
eyes 
swiftly 
from 
her 
husband 
to 
the 
things 
he
showed 
her.

"That's 
for 
Belova? 
Excellent!" 
She 
felt 
the<p>
quality 
of 
the 
material.
"It 
was 
a 
ruble 
an 
arshin, 
I 
suppose?"

Pierre 
told 
her 
the 
price.

"Too 
dear!"

bridge 
and 
began 
to 
emerge
on 
his 
side 
of 
it.

The 
infantry 
who 
had 
been 
stopped 
crowded 
near 
the 
bridge 
in 
the
trampled 
mud 
and 
gazed 
with 
that 
particular 
feeling 
of 
ill-will,
estrangement, 
and 
ridicule 
with 
which 
troops 
of 
different 
arms 
usually
encounter 
one 
another 
at 
the 
clean, 
smart 
hussars 
who 
moved 
past 
them 
in
regular 
order.

"Smart 
lads! 
Only 
fit 
for 
a 
fair!" 
said 
one.

"What 
good 
are 
they? 
They're 
led 
about 
just 
for 
show!" 
remarked
another.

"Don't<p>
kick 
up 
the 
dust, 
you 
infantry!" 
jested 
an 
hussar 
whose
prancing 
horse 
had 
splashed 
mud 
over 
some 
foot 
soldiers.

"I'd 
like 
to 
put 
you 
on 
a 
two 
days' 
march 
with 
a 
knapsack! 
Your
fine 
cords 
would 
soon 
get 
a 
bit 
rubbed," 
said 
an 
infantryman, 
wiping
the 
mud 
off 
his 
face 
with 
his 
sleeve. 
"Perched 
up 
there, 
you're 
more
like 
a 
bird 
than 
a 
man."

"There 
now, 
Zikin, 
they 
ought 
to 
put 
you 
on 
a 
horse. 
You'd 
look
fine," 
said 
a 
corporal, 
chaffing 
a 
thin 
little 
soldier 
who 
bent 
under
the 
weight 
of 
his 
knapsack.

"Take 
a 
stick 
between 
your 
legs, 
that'll 
suit 
you 
for 
a 
horse!"
the 
hussar 
shouted 
back.





CHAPTER 
VIII

The 
last 
of 
the 
infantry 
hurriedly 
crossed 
the 
bridge,<p>
squeezing
together 
as 
they 
approached 
it 
as 
if 
passing 
through 
a 
funnel. 
At 
last
the 
baggage 
wagons 
had 
all 
crossed, 
the 
crush 
was 
less, 
and 
the 
last
battalion 
came 
onto 
the 
bridge. 
Only 
Denisov's 
squadron 
of 
hussars
remained 
on 
the 
farther 
side 
of 
the 
bridge 
facing 
the 
enemy, 
who 
could
be 
seen 
from 
the 
hill 
on 
the 
opposite 
bank 
but 
was 
not 
yet 
visible 
from
the 
bridge, 
for 
the 
horizon 
as 
seen 
from 
the 
valley 
through 
which 
the
river 
flowed 
was 
formed 
by 
the 
rising 
ground 
only 
half 
a 
mile 
away.
At 
the 
foot 
of 
the<p>
hill 
lay 
wasteland 
over 
which 
a 
few 
groups 
of 
our
Cossack 
scouts 
were 
moving. 
Suddenly 
on 
the 
road 
at 
the 
top 
of 
the 
high
ground, 
artillery 
and 
troops 
in 
blue 
uniform 
were 
seen. 
These 
were 
the
French. 
A 
group 
of 
Cossack 
scouts 
retired 
down 
the 
hill 
at 
a 
trot. 
All
the 
officers 
and 
men 
of 
Denisov's 
squadron, 
though 
they 
tried 
to 
talk
of 
other 
things 
and 
to 
look 
in 
other 
directions, 
thought 
only 
of 
what
was 
there 
on 
the 
hilltop, 
and 
kept 
constantly 
looking 
at 
the 
patches
appearing 
on 
the 
skyline, 
which 
they 
knew 
to 
be 
the 
enemy's 
troops.
The 
weather 
had 
cleared 
again 
since 
noon 
and 
the 
sun 
was 
descending
brightly 
upon 
the 
Danube 
and 
the 
dark 
hills 
around 
it. 
It 
was 
calm, 
and
at 
intervals 
the 
bugle 
calls 
and 
the 
shouts 
of 
the 
enemy 
could 
be 
heard
from<p>
the 
hill. 
There 
was 
no 
one 
now 
between 
the 
squadron 
and 
the 
enemy
except

radiant 
with 
bliss,
looked 
eagerly 
toward 
his

waiting 
for 
the 
look

which 
she
longed.

sixteen<p>

was

happy,

gazed 
at

off

He 
gave 
her 
a

was 
still 
expectant

looking 
for 
someone. 
The 
old

had 
not

But 
now 
steps 
were 
heard 
at 
the 
door, 
steps
so 
rapid 
that 
they 
could 
hardly 
be 
his 
mother's.

Yet 
it 
was 
she, 
dressed 
in 
a 
new 
gown 
which 
he 
did 
not

made 
since
he 
had 
left. 
All

her. 
<a href="/cZl/jM2QD1ZS4jM.html">When</a>

XVII

After 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
had 
driven 
off 
with 
her 
son 
to 
visit 
Count 
Cyril
Vladimirovich 
Bezukhov, 
Countess 
Rostova 
sat 
for 
a 
long 
time 
all
alone 
applying 
her 
handkerchief 
to 
her 
eyes. 
At 
last 
she 
rang.

"What 
is 
the

my 
dear?" 
she 
said 
crossly

"Don't

The 
countess 
was 
upset 
by 
her 
friend's 
sorrow 
and 
humiliating 
poverty,
and 
was 
therefore 
out 
of 
sorts, 
a 
state 
of 
mind

with

always
found 
expression

calling

light 
in

"you

Pierre 
had 
long 
been 
familiar 
with 
that 
story. 
Karataev 
had 
told 
it
to 
him 
alone 
some 
half-dozen 
times 
and 
always 
with 
a 
specially 
joyful
emotion. 
But 
well 
as 
he 
knew 
it, 
Pierre 
now 
listened 
to 
that 
tale 
as 
to
something 
new, 
and 
the 
quiet 
rapture 
Karataev 
evidently 
felt 
as 
he 
told
it 
communicated 
itself 
also 
to 
Pierre. 
The 
story 
was 
of 
an 
old 
merchant
who 
lived 
a 
good 
and 
God-fearing 
life 
with 
his 
family, 
and 
who 
went 
once
to 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/ce5sbb6XKBx4bKMVG.html">Nizhni</a> 
fair 
with 
a 
companion-a 
rich 
merchant.

Having 
put 
up 
at 
an 
inn 
they 
both 
went 
to 
sleep, 
and 
next 
morning 
his
companion 
was 
found 
robbed 
and 
with 
his 
throat 
cut. 
A 
bloodstained 
knife
was 
found 
under 
the 
old 
merchant's 
pillow. 
He 
was 
tried, 
knouted, 
and
his 
nostrils 
having 
been 
torn 
off, 
"all 
in 
due<p>
form" 
as 
Karataev 
put 
it,
he 
was 
sent 
to 
hard 
labor 
in 
Siberia.

"And<p>
so, 
brother"<p>
(it 
was 
at 
this 
point 
that 
Pierre 
came 
up), 
"ten 
years
or 
more 
passed 
by. 
The 
old 
man 
was 
living 
as 
a 
convict, 
submitting 
as
he 
should 
and 
doing 
no 
wrong. 
Only 
he 
prayed 
to 
God 
for 
death. 
Well, 
one
night 
the 
convicts 
were 
gathered 
just 
as 
we 
are, 
with 
the 
old 
man 
among
them. 
And 
they 
began 
telling 
what 
each 
was 
suffering 
for, 
and 
how 
they
had 
sinned 
against 
God. 
One 
told 
how 
he 
had 
taken 
a 
life, 
<a href="/cZl/uqv6Nqwe39OgAj.html">another</a> 
had
taken 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">two,</a> 
a

had

a 
house 
on 
fire, 
while 
another 
had 
simply
been 
a 
vagrant 
and 
had 
done 
nothing. 
So 
they 
asked 
the 
old 
man: 
'What
are 
you 
being 
punished 
for, 
Daddy?'-'I, 
my 
dear 
brothers,' 
said 
he, 
'am
being 
punished 
for 
my 
own 
and 
other 
men's 
sins. 
But 
I 
have

a

my

<a href="/aVzUge/oe7jbnI0ct8.html">and</a>

am 
sorry 
for 
my 
old

and 
the

and 
the 
old 
man 
began
to 
weep. 
Now 
it 
happened 
that 
in 
the 
group 
was 
the

had

CHAPTER 
XXXIII

On 
the 
third 
of 
September 
Pierre 
awoke 
late. 
His 
head 
was 
aching, 
the
clothes 
in 
which 
he 
had 
slept 
without 
undressing 
felt 
uncomfortable 
on
his 
body, 
and 
his 
mind 
had 
a 
dim 
consciousness 
of 
something 
shameful
he 
had 
done 
the 
day 
before. 
That 
something 
shameful 
was 
his 
yesterday's
conversation 
with 
Captain 
Ramballe.

It 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dd9XZEHJ3g8CKMN.html">was</a> 
eleven 
by 
the 
clock, 
but 
it 
seemed 
peculiarly 
dark 
out 
of 
doors.
Pierre 
rose, 
rubbed 
his 
eyes, 
and 
seeing 
the 
pistol 
with 
an 
engraved
stock 
which 
Gerasim 
had 
replaced 
on 
the 
writing 
table, 
he 
remembered
where 
he 
was 
and

"Am 
I 
not

he 
thought. 
"No, 
probably 
he 
won't 
make 
his 
entry
into

Pierre 
did 
not 
allow 
himself 
to 
reflect 
on 
what 
lay 
before 
him,<p>
but
hastened 
to 
act.

After 
arranging 
his 
clothes, 
he 
took 
the 
pistol 
and 
was 
about 
to 
go 
out.
But 
it 
then 
occurred 
to 
him 
for 
the 
first 
time 
that 
he 
certainly 
could
not 
carry 
the 
weapon 
in 
his 
hand 
through 
the 
streets. 
It 
was 
difficult
to 
hide 
such 
a 
big 
pistol 
even 
under 
his 
wide 
coat. 
He 
could 
not
carry 
it 
unnoticed 
in 
his 
belt 
or 
under 
his 
arm. 
Besides, 
it 
had 
been
discharged, 
and 
he 
had 
not 
had 
time 
to 
reload<p>
it. 
"No

the 
dagger

do," 
he 
said 
to 
himself,

he

Count 
Rostopchin 
suddenly 
grew 
pale 
as 
he 
had 
done 
when 
the 
crowd 
closed
in 
on 
Vereshchagin. 
He 
turned 
away. 
"Go 
fas... 
faster!" 
he 
cried 
in 
a
trembling 
voice 
to 
his 
coachman. 
The 
caleche 
flew 
over 
the 
ground 
as
fast 
as 
the 
horses 
could 
draw 
it, 
but 
for 
a 
long 
time 
Count 
Rostopchin
still 
heard 
the 
insane 
despairing 
screams 
growing 
fainter 
in 
the
distance, 
while 
his 
eyes 
saw 
nothing 
but 
the 
astonished, 
frightened,
bloodstained 
face 
of 
"the 
traitor" 
in 
the 
fur-lined 
coat.

Recent 
as 
that 
mental 
picture 
was, 
Rostopchin 
already 
felt 
that 
it 
had
cut 
deep 
into 
his 
heart 
and 
drawn 
blood. 
Even 
now<p>
he 
felt 
clearly 
that
the 
gory 
trace 
of 
that 
recollection 
would 
not 
pass 
with 
time, 
but 
that
the 
terrible 
memory 
would, 
on 
the 
contrary, 
dwell 
in 
his 
heart 
ever 
more
cruelly 
and 
painfully 
to 
the 
end 
of 
his 
life. 
He 
seemed 
still 
to 
hear
the 
sound 
of 
his 
own 
words: 
"Cut 
him 
down! 
I 
command 
it...."

"Why 
did 
I 
utter 
those 
words? 
It 
was 
by 
some 
accident 
I 
said 
them....
I 
need 
not 
have 
said 
them," 
he 
thought. 
"And 
then 
nothing 
would 
have
happened." 
He 
saw 
the 
frightened 
and 
then 
infuriated 
face 
of 
the 
dragoon
who 
dealt 
the 
blow, 
the 
look 
of 
silent, 
timid 
reproach 
that 
boy 
in 
the
fur-lined 
coat 
had 
turned 
upon 
him. 
"But 
I 
did 
not 
do 
it 
for 
my 
own
sake. 
I 
was 
bound 
to 
act 
that 
way.... 
The 
mob, 
the 
traitor... 
the 
public
welfare," 
thought 
he.

Troops 
were 
still 
crowding 
at 
the 
Yauza 
bridge. 
It 
was 
hot. 
Kutuzov,
dejected 
and 
frowning, 
sat 
on 
a 
bench 
by 
the 
bridge 
toying 
with 
his
whip 
in 
the 
sand 
when 
a 
caleche 
dashed 
up 
noisily. 
A 
man<p>
in 
a 
general's
uniform 
with 
plumes 
in 
his 
hat 
went 
up 
to 
Kutuzov 
and 
said 
something
in 
French. 
It 
was 
Count 
Rostopchin. 
He 
told 
Kutuzov 
that 
he 
had 
come
because 
Moscow, 
the 
capital, 
was 
no 
more 
and 
only 
the 
army 
remained.

"Things 
would 
have 
been 
different 
if 
your 
Serene 
Highness 
had 
not 
told
me 
that 
you 
would 
not 
abandon 
Moscow 
without 
another 
battle; 
all 
this
would 
not 
have 
happened," 
he 
said.

Kutuzov 
looked 
at 
Rostopchin 
as 
if, 
not 
grasping 
what 
was 
said 
to 
him,
he 
was 
trying 
to 
read 
something 
peculiar 
written 
at 
that 
moment 
on 
the
face 
of 
the 
man 
addressing 
him. 
Rostopchin 
grew 
confused 
and 
became
silent. 
Kutuzov 
slightly 
shook 
his 
head 
and 
not 
taking 
his 
penetrating
gaze 
from 
Rostopchin's 
face 
muttered 
softly:

"No! 
I 
shall 
not 
give 
up 
Moscow 
without 
a 
battle!"

Whether 
Kutuzov 
was 
thinking 
of 
something 
entirely 
different 
when
he 
spoke 
those 
words, 
or 
uttered 
them<p>
purposely, 
knowing 
them 
to 
be
meaningless, 
at 
any 
rate 
Rostopchin 
made 
no 
reply 
and 
hastily 
left 
him.
And 
strange 
to 
say, 
<a href="/aVzUge/hp8Ro6H8Fmd.html">the</a> 
Governor 
of 
Moscow, 
the 
proud 
Count 
Rostopchin,
took

to 
the 
bridge

he 
began 
with 
shouts
to 
drive

CHAPTER 
XXVI

Toward 
four 
o'clock 
in 
the 
afternoon 
Murat's 
troops 
were 
entering
Moscow. 
In 
front 
rode 
a 
detachment 
of 
Wuerttemberg 
hussars 
and 
behind
them 
rode 
the 
King 
of 
Naples 
himself 
accompanied 
by 
a 
numerous 
suite.

About 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
Arbat 
Street, 
near 
the 
Church 
of 
the 
Miraculous
Icon 
of 
St. 
Nicholas, 
Murat 
halted 
to 
await 
news 
from 
the 
advanced
detachment 
as 
to 
the<p>
condition 
in 
which 
they 
had 
found 
the 
citadel, 
le
Kremlin.

Around 
Murat 
gathered 
a 
group 
of 
those 
who 
had 
remained 
in<p>
Moscow. 
They
all 
stared 
in 
timid 
bewilderment 
at 
the 
strange, 
long-haired 
commander
dressed 
up 
in 
feathers 
and 
gold.

"Is 
that 
their 
Tsar 
himself? 
He's 
not 
bad!" 
low 
voices 
could 
be 
heard
saying.

An 
interpreter 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
group.

"Take 
off 
your 
cap... 
your 
caps!" 
These 
words 
went 
from 
one 
to 
another
in 
the 
crowd. 
The 
interpreter 
addressed 
an 
old 
porter 
and 
asked 
if
it 
was 
far 
to 
the 
Kremlin. 
The 
porter, 
listening 
in 
perplexity 
to 
the
unfamiliar 
Polish 
accent

After 
swallowing 
a 
little 
she 
had 
been 
so 
frightened 
that 
she
woke 
Sonya 
and 
told 
her 
what 
she 
had 
done. 
The 
necessary 
antidotes 
had
been 
administered 
in 
time 
and 
she 
was 
now 
out 
of 
danger, 
though 
still 
so
weak 
that 
it 
was 
out 
of 
the 
question 
to 
move 
her 
to 
the 
country, 
and
so 
the 
countess 
had 
been 
sent 
for. 
Pierre 
saw 
the 
distracted 
count, 
and
Sonya, 
who 
had 
a 
tear-stained 
face, 
but 
he 
could 
not 
see 
Natasha.

Pierre 
dined 
at 
the 
club 
that 
day 
and 
heard 
on 
all 
sides 
gossip 
about
the 
attempted 
abduction 
of 
Rostova. 
He 
resolutely 
denied 
these
rumors, 
assuring 
everyone 
that 
nothing 
had 
happened 
except 
that 
his
brother-in-law 
had 
proposed 
to 
her 
and 
been 
refused. 
It 
seemed 
to
Pierre 
that 
it 
was 
his 
duty 
to 
conceal 
the 
whole 
affair 
and 
re-establish
Natasha's 
reputation.

He 
was 
awaiting 
Prince 
Andrew's 
return 
with 
dread 
and<p>
went 
every 
day 
to
the<p>
old 
prince's 
for 
news 
of 
him.

Old 
Prince 
Bolkonski 
heard 
all 
the 
rumors 
current 
in 
the 
town 
from
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
and 
had 
read 
the 
note 
to 
Princess 
Mary 
in 
which
Natasha 
had 
broken 
off 
her 
engagement. 
He 
seemed<p>
in 
better<p>
spirits 
than
usual 
and 
awaited 
his 
son 
with 
great 
impatience.

Some 
days 
after 
Anatole's 
departure 
Pierre 
received 
a 
note 
from 
Prince
Andrew, 
informing 
him 
of 
his 
<a href="/cZl/up4Xs5AF1tTZW.html">arrival</a> 
and 
asking<p>
him 
to 
come 
to 
see 
him.

As 
soon 
as 
he 
reached 
Moscow, 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
received 
from 
his
father 
Natasha's 
note 
to 
Princess 
Mary 
breaking 
off 
her 
engagement
(Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
had 
purloined 
it 
from 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
given
it 
to 
the 
old 
prince), 
and 
he 
heard 
from 
him 
the 
story 
of 
Natasha's
elopement, 
with 
additions.

Prince 
Andrew 
had 
arrived 
in 
the 
evening 
and 
Pierre 
came 
to 
see 
him 
next
morning. 
Pierre 
expected<p>
to 
find 
Prince 
Andrew 
in 
almost 
the 
same 
state
as 
Natasha<p>
and 
was 
therefore 
surprised 
on 
entering 
the 
drawing 
room
to 
hear 
him 
in 
the 
study 
talking 
in 
a 
loud 
animated 
voice 
about 
some
intrigue 
going 
on 
in 
Petersburg. 
The 
old 
prince's 
voice 
and 
another 
now
and 
then 
interrupted 
him. 
Princess 
Mary 
came 
out 
to 
meet 
Pierre. 
She
sighed, 
looking 
toward 
the 
door 
of 
the 
room 
where 
Prince<p>
Andrew 
was,
evidently 
intending 
to 
express 
her 
sympathy 
with 
his 
sorrow, 
but 
Pierre
saw 
by 
her 
face 
that 
she 
was 
glad 
both 
at 
what 
had 
happened 
and 
at 
the
way 
her 
brother 
had 
taken 
the 
news 
of 
Natasha's 
faithlessness.

"He 
says 
he 
expected 
it," 
she<p>
remarked. 
"I 
know 
his 
pride 
will 
not 
let
him 
express 
his 
feelings, 
but 
still 
he 
has 
taken 
it 
better, 
far 
better,
than 
I 
expected. 
Evidently 
it 
had 
to 
be...."

"But 
is 
it 
possible 
that 
all 
is 
really 
ended?" 
asked 
Pierre.

Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
him 
with 
astonishment. 
She 
did 
not 
understand
how 
he 
could 
ask 
such 
a 
question. 
Pierre 
went 
into 
the 
study. 
Prince
Andrew, 
greatly 
changed 
and 
plainly 
in 
better 
health, 
but 
with 
a 
fresh
horizontal 
wrinkle 
between 
his 
brows, 
stood 
in 
civilian 
dress 
facing
his 
father 
and 
Prince 
Meshcherski, 
warmly 
disputing 
and 
vigorously
gesticulating. 
The 
conversation 
was 
about 
Speranski-the 
news 
of 
whose
sudden 
exile 
and 
alleged 
treachery 
had 
just 
reached 
Moscow.

"Now 
he 
is 
censured<p>
and 
accused 
by 
all 
who 
were 
enthusiastic 
about 
him
a 
month 
ago," 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
saying, 
"and

were

understand

aims.

suddenly
pale, 
and 
added, 
"Look 
at

man."

Rostov 
took 
the 
purse 
in 
his 
hand, 
examined 
it 
and 
the 
money 
in 
it, 
and
looked 
at 
Telyanin. 
The 
lieutenant 
was 
looking 
about 
in 
his 
usual 
way
and 
suddenly 
seemed 
to 
grow 
very 
merry.

"If 
we 
get 
to 
Vienna 
I'll 
get 
rid 
of 
it 
there 
but 
in 
these 
wretched
little 
towns 
there's 
nowhere 
to 
spend 
it," 
said 
he. 
"Well, 
let 
me
have 
it, 
young 
man, 
I'm 
going."

Rostov<p>
did 
not 
speak.

"And 
you? 
Are 
you 
going 
to 
have 
lunch 
too? 
They 
feed 
you 
quite
decently 
here," 
continued 
Telyanin. 
<a href="/aVzUge/Wx2ReoD1oqP.html">"Now</a> 
then, 
let 
me 
have 
it."

He 
stretched 
out 
his 
hand 
to 
take 
hold 
of 
the 
purse. 
Rostov 
let 
go 
of
it. 
Telyanin 
took 
the 
purse 
and 
began 
carelessly 
slipping 
it 
into 
the
pocket 
of 
his 
riding 
breeches, 
with 
his 
eyebrows 
lifted 
and 
his 
mouth
slightly 
open, 
as 
if 
to 
say, 
"Yes, 
yes, 
I 
am 
putting 
my 
purse 
in 
my
pocket 
and 
that's 
quite 
simple 
and 
is 
no 
one 
else's 
business."

"Well, 
young 
man?" 
he 
said 
with 
a 
sigh, 
and 
from 
under 
his 
lifted
brows 
he 
glanced 
into 
Rostov's 
eyes.

Some 
flash 
as 
of 
an 
electric 
spark 
shot 
from 
Telyanin's 
eyes 
to
Rostov's 
and 
back, 
and 
back 
again 
and 
again 
in 
an 
instant.

"Come 
here," 
said 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">Rostov,</a> 
catching 
hold 
of<p>
Telyanin's 
arm 
and
almost 
dragging 
him 
to 
the 
window. 
"That 
money 
is 
Denisov's; 
you
took 
it..." 
he 
whispered 
just 
above 
Telyanin's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oUZ59J1bI.html">ear.

"What?</a> 
What? 
How 
dare 
you? 
What?" 
said 
Telyanin.

But 
these 
words 
came 
like 
a 
piteous, 
despairing 
cry 
and 
an 
entreaty 
for
pardon. 
As 
soon 
as 
Rostov 
heard 
them, 
an 
enormous 
load 
of 
doubt
fell 
from 
him. 
He 
was 
glad, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
instant 
began 
to 
pity 
the
miserable 
man 
who 
stood 
before 
him, 
but 
the 
task 
he 
had 
begun 
had 
to 
be
completed.

"Heaven

Telyanin, 
taking 
up 
his

moving 
toward 
a 
small 
empty

"We

Rostov.

to 
quiver, 
his

still 
shifted 
from 
side 
to 
side

with 
a 
downward 
look

rising
to 
Rostov's 
face,

his 
sobs 
were 
audible.

Julie

accepted

She

twenty-seven. 
After

death 
of

she

She

plain, 
but 
thought 
herself 
not
merely 
as 
good-looking 
as 
before 
but 
even

more

She
was 
confirmed 
in 
this 
delusion 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
had 
become 
a 
very

and 
also

the

and 
the 
more

could 
associate

her 
and 
avail 
themselves 
of 
her

and 
the

that 
assembled 
at

without

A

ten

before 
of 
going 
every

to 
the 
house 
when 
there 
was 
a 
girl 
of 
seventeen 
there, 
for 
fear 
of
compromising 
her 
and 
committing 
himself, 
would 
now 
go 
boldly 
every 
day
and 
treat 
her 
not 
as 
a 
marriageable 
girl 
but 
as

Nesvitski

an

Zherkov.

aroused 
by

the

the

of 
what

found 
vent 
in 
anger 
at

untimely

"If

"I

"Come,

"Don't

even 
were 
they 
ten

But

What

they

no

for 
men
or

He

his 
word 
he 
would 
not 
retreat, 
but 
suddenly 
sent
instructions 
that 
he 
was 
retiring 
that 
night. 
We 
cannot 
fight 
in 
this

or 
we

the

Moscow....

There 
is 
a 
rumor 
that 
you 
are 
thinking 
of 
peace. 
God 
forbid 
that 
you
should 
make 
peace 
after 
all 
our 
sacrifices 
and 
such 
insane 
retreats! 
You
would 
set 
all 
Russia 
against 
you 
and 
everyone 
of 
us 
would 
feel 
ashamed
to 
wear 
the 
uniform. 
If 
it 
has 
come 
to 
this-we 
must 
fight 
as 
long 
as
Russia 
can 
and 
as 
long 
as 
there 
are 
men 
able 
to 
stand....

One 
man 
ought 
to 
be 
in 
command, 
and 
not 
two. 
Your 
Minister 
may 
perhaps
be 
good 
as 
a 
Minister, 
but 
as 
a 
general 
he 
is 
not 
merely 
bad 
but
execrable, 
yet 
to 
him 
is 
entrusted 
the 
fate 
of 
our<p>
whole 
country.... 
I
am 
really 
frantic 
with 
vexation; 
forgive 
my 
writing 
boldly. 
It 
is 
clear
that 
the 
man 
who 
advocates 
the 
conclusion 
of 
a 
peace, 
and 
that 
the
Minister 
should 
command 
the 
army, 
does 
not 
love 
our 
sovereign 
and
desires 
the 
ruin 
of 
us 
all.<p>
So 
I 
write 
you 
frankly: 
call 
out 
the
militia. 
For 
the 
Minister 
is 
leading 
these 
visitors 
after 
him 
to 
Moscow
in 
a 
most 
masterly 
way. 
The 
whole 
army 
feels 
great 
suspicion 
of 
the
Imperial 
aide-de-camp 
Wolzogen. 
He 
is 
said 
to 
be 
more 
Napoleon's 
man
than 
ours, 
and 
he 
is 
always 
advising 
the 
Minister. 
I 
am 
not 
merely 
civil
to 
him 
but 
obey 
him 
like 
a 
corporal, 
though 
I 
am 
his 
senior. 
This 
is
painful, 
but, 
loving 
my 
benefactor 
and 
sovereign, 
I 
submit. 
Only 
I 
am
sorry 
for 
the 
Emperor 
that 
he 
entrusts 
our 
fine 
army 
to 
such 
as 
he.
Consider 
that 
on 
our 
retreat 
we 
have 
lost 
by 
fatigue 
and 
left 
in 
the
hospital 
more 
than 
fifteen 
thousand 
men, 
and 
had 
we 
attacked 
this 
would
not 
have 
happened. 
Tell 
me, 
for 
God's 
sake, 
what 
will 
Russia, 
our 
mother
Russia, 
say 
to 
our 
being 
so 
frightened, 
and 
why 
are 
we 
abandoning 
our
good 
and 
gallant<p>
Fatherland 
to 
such 
rabble 
and 
implanting 
feelings 
of
hatred 
and 
shame 
in 
all 
our 
subjects? 
What 
are 
we 
scared 
at 
and 
of 
whom
are 
we 
afraid? 
I 
am 
not 
to 
blame 
that 
the 
Minister 
is 
vacillating,
a 
coward, 
dense, 
dilatory, 
and 
has 
all 
bad 
qualities. 
The 
whole 
army
bewails 
it 
and 
calls 
down 
curses 
upon 
him....

would 
excuse 
her 
want 
of

and 
come 
upstairs 
to 
her

In 
a 
rather 
low 
room 
lit 
by 
one 
candle 
sat 
the 
princess 
and 
with 
her
another 
person 
dressed 
in 
black. 
Pierre 
remembered 
that 
the 
princess
always 
had 
lady 
companions, 
but 
who 
they 
were 
and 
what 
they 
were 
like
he 
never 
knew 
<a href="/cZl/Ri5U63U.html">or</a> 
remembered. 
"This 
must 
be 
one 
of 
her 
companions," 
he
thought, 
glancing 
at 
the 
lady 
in 
<a href="/cZl/kt2kz2w9dJM.html">the</a> 
black 
dress.

The 
princess 
rose 
quickly 
to 
meet 
him 
and 
held 
out 
her 
hand.

"Yes," 
she 
said, 
looking 
at 
his 
altered 
face 
after 
he 
had 
kissed 
her
hand, 
"so 
this 
is 
how 
we 
meet 
again. 
He 
spoke 
of 
you 
even 
at 
the 
very
last," 
she 
went 
on, 
turning 
her 
eyes 
from 
Pierre 
to 
her 
companion 
with 
a
shyness 
that 
surprised 
him 
for 
an 
instant.

"I 
was 
so 
glad 
to 
hear 
of 
your<p>
safety. 
It 
was 
the 
first 
piece 
of 
good
news 
we 
had 
received 
for 
a 
long 
time."

Again 
the 
princess 
glanced 
round 
at 
her 
companion 
with 
even 
more
uneasiness 
in 
her 
manner 
and 
was 
about 
to 
add 
something, 
but 
Pierre
interrupted 
her.

"Just 
imagine-I 
knew 
nothing 
about 
him!" 
said 
he. 
"I 
thought 
he 
had 
been
killed. 
All 
I 
know 
I 
heard 
at 
second 
hand 
from 
others. 
I 
only 
know 
that
he 
fell 
in 
with 
the 
Rostovs.... 
What 
a 
strange 
coincidence!"

Pierre 
spoke 
rapidly 
and 
with 
animation. 
He 
glanced 
once 
at 
the
companion's 
face, 
saw 
her 
attentive 
and 
kindly 
gaze 
fixed 
on 
him, 
and,
as 
often 
happens 
when 
one 
is 
talking, 
felt 
somehow 
that 
this 
companion
in 
the 
black 
dress 
was 
a 
good, 
kind, 
excellent 
creature 
who 
would 
not
hinder 
his 
conversing 
freely 
with 
Princess 
Mary.

But 
when 
he 
mentioned 
the 
Rostovs, 
Princess 
Mary's 
face 
expressed 
still
greater 
embarrassment. 
She 
again 
glanced 
rapidly 
from 
Pierre's 
face 
to
that 
of 
the 
lady 
in 
the 
black 
dress 
and 
said:

"Do 
you 
really 
not 
recognize 
her?"

Pierre 
looked 
again 
at 
the 
companion's 
pale, 
delicate 
face 
with 
its
black 
eyes 
and 
peculiar 
mouth, 
and 
something 
near 
to 
him, 
long 
forgotten
and 
more 
than 
sweet, 
looked 
at 
him 
from 
those 
attentive 
eyes.

"But 
no, 
it 
can't 
be!" 
he 
thought. 
"This 
stern, 
thin, 
pale 
face 
that
looks 
so 
much 
older! 
It 
cannot 
<a href="/cZl/CM9vGX9bf1.html">be</a> 
she. 
It 
merely 
reminds 
me 
of 
her."
But 
at 
that 
moment 
Princess 
Mary 
said, 
"Natasha!" 
And 
with 
difficulty,
effort, 
and 
stress, 
like 
the 
opening 
of 
a 
door 
grown 
rusty 
on 
its
hinges, 
a 
smile 
appeared 
on 
the 
face 
with 
the 
attentive 
eyes, 
and 
from
that 
opening 
door 
came 
a

When

it 
was 
Natasha 
and 
he

At

to

a

He 
flushed 
joyfully 
yet 
with 
painful 
distress. 
He 
tried 
to 
hide 
his
agitation. 
But 
the 
more 
he 
tried 
to 
hide 
it 
the 
more 
clearly-clearer

he 
betray

that

her.

"No, 
it's

of

thought 
Pierre. 
But 
as

he

the

trying

Prince 
Andrew 
glanced 
again 
at 
the 
artillery 
officer's 
small 
figure.
There 
was 
something 
peculiar 
about 
it, 
quite 
unsoldierly, 
rather 
comic,
but 
extremely 
attractive.

The 
staff 
officer 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
mounted 
their 
horses 
and 
rode 
on.

Having 
ridden 
beyond 
the 
village, 
continually 
meeting 
and 
overtaking
soldiers 
and 
officers 
of 
various 
regiments, 
they 
saw 
on 
their

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/pX5XZWkd6KpkPN5XZEHJ.html">some

being 
thrown 
up,<p>

of

showed 
up

Several 
battalions 
of 
soldiers, 
in 
their

sleeves 
despite
the 
cold 
wind, 
swarmed 
in 
these 
earthworks 
like 
a

ants;
spadefuls 
of 
red 
clay 
were 
continually 
being 
thrown 
up 
from 
behind 
the
bank 
by 
unseen 
hands. 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
the 
officer 
rode 
up,<p>
looked 
at
the 
entrenchment, 
and 
went 
on 
again. 
Just 
behind 
it 
they 
came 
upon 
some
dozens 
of 
soldiers, 
continually 
replaced 
by 
others, 
who 
ran 
from 
the
entrenchment. 
They 
had 
to 
hold 
their 
noses 
and 
put 
their 
horses 
to 
a
trot 
to 
escape 
from 
the 
poisoned 
atmosphere 
of 
these 
latrines.

"This

They 
rode 
up 
the 
opposite 
hill. 
From 
there 
the 
French 
could 
already 
be
seen. 
Prince 
Andrew 
stopped 
and 
began 
examining 
the 
position.

"That's 
our 
battery," 
said 
the 
staff

indicating 
the
highest 
point. 
"It's

"Thank

So

they

so 
said 
the 
grown-up 
young 
men

women 
who
came 
to 
these 
balls 
with 
an 
air 
of 
condescension

found 
them 
most

That 
year 
two

had 
come 
of 
these 
balls. 
The

met

so

the

The

without

His

two!..." 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
a 
silence 
followed: 
"three!" 
and 
a 
rapturously
breathless 
cry 
of 
children's 
voices 
filled 
the 
room. 
"Two, 
two!" 
they
shouted.

This 
meant 
two 
stockings, 
which 
by 
a 
secret 
process 
known 
only 
to
herself 
Anna 
Makarovna 
used 
to 
knit 
at 
the 
same 
time 
on 
the 
same
needles, 
and 
which, 
when 
they 
were 
ready, 
she 
always 
triumphantly 
drew,
one 
out 
of 
the 
other, 
in 
the 
children's 
presence.





CHAPTER 
XIV

Soon 
after 
this 
the 
children 
came 
in 
to 
say 
good 
night. 
They 
kissed
everyone, 
the 
tutors 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xg3s7mGGRm3bvO.html">governesses</a> 
made 
their 
bows, 
and 
they 
went 
out.
Only 
young 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
tutor 
remained. 
Dessalles 
whispered 
to 
the
boy 
to 
come 
downstairs.

"No, 
Monsieur 
Dessalles, 
I 
will 
ask 
my 
aunt 
to 
let 
me 
stay," 
replied
Nicholas 
Bolkonski 
also 
in 
a 
whisper.

"Ma 
tante, 
please 
let 
me 
stay," 
said 
he, 
going 
up 
to 
his 
aunt.

His 
face 
expressed 
entreaty, 
agitation, 
and 
ecstasy. 
Countess 
Mary
glanced 
at 
him 
and 
turned 
to 
Pierre.

"When 
you 
are 
here 
he 
can't 
tear 
himself 
away," 
she 
said.

"I 
will 
bring 
him 
to 
you 
directly, 
Monsieur 
Dessalles. 
Good 
night!"
said 
Pierre, 
giving 
his 
hand 
to 
the 
Swiss 
tutor, 
and 
he 
turned 
to 
young
Nicholas 
with 
a 
smile. 
"You 
and 
I 
haven't 
seen 
anything 
of 
one 
another
yet.... 
How 
like 
he 
is 
growing, 
Mary!" 
he 
added, 
addressing 
Countess
Mary.

"Like 
my 
father?" 
asked 
the 
boy, 
flushing 
crimson 
and 
looking 
up 
at
Pierre 
with 
bright, 
ecstatic 
eyes.

Pierre 
nodded, 
and 
went 
on 
with 
what 
he 
had 
been 
saying 
when 
the
children 
had 
interrupted. 
Countess 
Mary 
sat 
down 
doing 
woolwork; 
Natasha
did 
not 
take 
her 
eyes 
off 
her 
husband. 
Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
rose, 
asked
for 
their 
pipes, 
smoked, 
went 
to 
fetch 
more 
tea 
from 
Sonya-who 
sat 
weary
but 
resolute 
at 
the 
samovar-and 
questioned 
Pierre. 
The 
curly-headed,
delicate 
boy 
sat 
with 
shining 
eyes 
unnoticed 
in 
a 
corner, 
starting
every 
now 
and 
then 
and 
muttering 
something 
to 
himself, 
and 
evidently
experiencing 
a 
new 
and 
powerful 
emotion 
as 
he 
turned 
his 
curly 
head,
with 
his 
thin 
neck 
exposed 
by 
his 
turn-down 
collar, 
toward 
the 
place
where 
Pierre 
sat.

The 
conversation 
turned 
on 
the 
contemporary 
gossip 
about 
those 
in 
power,
in 
which 
most 
people 
see 
the 
chief 
interest 
of 
home 
politics. 
Denisov,
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
government 
on 
account 
of 
his 
own 
disappointments
in 
the 
service, 
heard 
with 
pleasure 
of 
the 
things 
done 
in 
Petersburg
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
stupid, 
and 
made 
forcible 
and 
sharp 
comments 
on 
what
Pierre 
told 
them.

"One 
used 
to 
have 
to 
be 
a 
German-now 
one 
must 
dance 
with 
Tatawinova
and 
Madame 
Kwuedener, 
and 
wead 
Ecka'tshausen 
and 
the 
bwethwen. 
Oh, 
they
should 
let 
that 
fine 
fellow 
Bonaparte 
loose-he'd 
knock 
all 
this 
nonsense
out 
of 
them! 
Fancy 
giving 
the 
command 
of 
the 
Semenov 
wegiment 
to 
a
fellow 
like 
that 
Schwa'tz!" 
he 
cried.

Nicholas, 
though 
free 
from 
Denisov's 
readiness 
to 
find 
fault 
with
everything, 
also 
thought 
that 
discussion 
of 
the 
government 
was 
a 
very
serious 
and 
weighty 
matter, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
A 
had 
been 
appointed
Minister 
of 
This 
and 
B 
Governor 
General 
of 
That, 
and 
that 
the 
Emperor
had 
said 
so-and-so 
and 
this 
minister 
so-and-so, 
seemed 
to 
him 
very
important. 
And 
so 
he 
thought 
it 
necessary 
to 
take 
an 
interest 
in 
these
things 
and 
to 
question 
Pierre. 
The 
questions 
put 
by 
these 
two 
kept 
the
conversation 
from 
changing 
its 
ordinary 
character 
of 
gossip 
about 
the
higher 
government<p>
circles.

But 
Natasha, 
knowing 
all 
her 
husband's 
ways 
and 
ideas, 
saw 
that 
he 
had
long 
been 
wishing 
but 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
divert 
the 
conversation 
to
another 
channel

Julie 
played 
most</h1>doleful 
nocturnes 
on 
her 
harp. 
Boris
read 
Poor 
Liza 
aloud 
to 
her, 
and 
more 
than 
once 
interrupted 
the 
reading
because 
of 
the 
emotions 
that 
choked 
him. 
Meeting 
at 
large 
gatherings
Julie 
and 
Boris 
looked 
on 
one 
another 
as 
the 
only 
souls 
who<p>
understood
one 
another<p>
in 
a 
world 
of 
indifferent 
people.

Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
who 
often 
visited 
the 
Karagins, 
while 
playing 
cards
with 
the 
mother 
made 
careful 
inquiries 
as 
to 
Julie's 
dowry 
(she 
was
to 
have 
two 
estates 
in 
Penza 
and 
the 
<a href="/cZl/lg7mk5rqw7Yg.html">Nizhegorod</a> 
forests). 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
regarded 
the 
refined 
sadness 
that 
united 
her 
son 
to 
the
wealthy 
Julie 
with 
emotion, 
and 
resignation 
to 
the 
Divine 
will.

"You 
are 
always 
charming 
and 
melancholy, 
my 
dear 
Julie," 
she 
said 
to
the 
daughter. 
"Boris 
says 
his 
soul 
finds 
repose 
at 
your 
house. 
He 
has
suffered 
so 
many 
disappointments 
and 
is 
so 
sensitive," 
said 
she 
to
the 
mother. 
"Ah, 
my 
dear, 
I 
can't 
tell 
you 
how 
fond 
I 
have 
grown
of 
Julie 
latterly," 
she 
said 
to 
her 
son. 
"But 
who 
could 
help 
loving
her? 
She 
is 
an 
angelic 
being! 
Ah, 
Boris, 
Boris!"-she 
paused.
"And 
how 
I 
pity 
her 
mother," 
she 
went 
on; 
"today 
she 
showed 
me 
her
accounts 
and 
letters 
from 
Penza 
(they 
have 
enormous 
estates 
there), 
and
she, 
poor 
thing, 
has 
no 
one 
to 
help 
her, 
and 
they 
do 
cheat 
her 
so!"

Boris 
smiled 
almost 
imperceptibly 
while 
listening 
to 
his 
mother. 
He
laughed 
blandly 
at 
her 
naive 
diplomacy 
but 
listened 
to 
what 
she 
had
to 
say, 
and 
sometimes 
questioned 
her 
carefully 
about 
the 
Penza 
and
Nizhegorod 
estates.

Julie 
had 
long 
been 
expecting 
a 
proposal 
from 
her 
melancholy 
adorer 
and
was 
ready 
to 
accept 
it; 
but 
some 
secret 
feeling 
of 
repulsion 
for 
her,
for 
her 
passionate 
desire 
to 
get 
married, 
for 
her 
artificiality, 
and
a 
feeling 
of 
horror 
at 
renouncing 
the 
possibility 
of 
real<p>
love 
still
restrained 
Boris. 
His 
leave 
was 
expiring. 
He 
spent 
every 
day 
and 
whole
days 
at 
the 
Karagins', 
and 
every 
day 
on 
thinking 
the 
matter 
over
told 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
propose 
tomorrow. 
But 
in 
Julie's 
presence,
looking 
at 
her 
red 
face 
and 
chin 
(nearly 
always 
powdered), 
her<p>
moist
eyes, 
and 
her 
expression 
of 
continual 
readiness 
to 
pass 
at 
once 
from
melancholy 
to 
an 
unnatural 
rapture 
of 
married 
bliss, 
Boris 
could 
not
utter 
the 
decisive 
words, 
though 
in 
imagination 
he 
had 
long 
regarded
himself 
as 
the 
possessor 
of 
those 
Penza 
and 
Nizhegorod 
estates 
and
had 
apportioned 
the 
use 
of 
the 
income 
from 
them. 
Julie 
saw 
Boris'
indecision, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
thought 
occurred 
to 
her 
that 
she 
was
repulsive 
to 
him, 
but 
her 
feminine 
self-deception 
immediately 
<a href="/cZl/aK9AgW7Uo9.html">supplied
her</a> 
with 
consolation, 
and 
she 
told 
herself 
that 
he 
was 
only 
shy 
from
love. 
Her 
melancholy, 
however, 
began 
to 
turn 
to 
irritability, 
and 
not
long 
before 
Boris' 
departure 
she 
formed 
a 
definite 
plan 
of 
action.
Just 
as 
Boris' 
leave 
of 
absence 
was 
expiring, 
Anatole 
Kuragin 
made
his 
appearance 
in 
Moscow, 
and 
of 
course 
in 
the 
Karagins' 
drawing
room, 
and 
Julie, 
suddenly 
abandoning 
her 
melancholy, 
became 
cheerful 
and
very 
attentive 
to 
Kuragin.

"My 
dear," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
to 
her 
son, 
"I 
know 
from 
a
reliable 
source 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
has 
sent 
his 
son 
to 
Moscow 
to 
get
him 
married 
to 
Julie. 
I<p>
am 
so 
fond 
of 
Julie 
that 
I 
should 
be 
sorry 
<a href="/aVzUge/yf2RPI5oL5trTR.html">for
her.</a> 
What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
it, 
my 
dear?"

The 
idea 
of 
being 
made 
a 
fool 
of 
and 
of 
having 
thrown 
away 
that 
whole
month 
of 
arduous 
melancholy 
service 
to 
Julie, 
and 
of 
seeing 
all
the 
revenue 
from 
the 
Penza 
estates 
which 
he 
had 
already 
mentally
apportioned 
and 
put 
to 
proper 
use 
fall 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
another, 
and
especially 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
that 
idiot 
Anatole, 
pained 
Boris. 
He 
drove
to 
the 
Karagins' 
with 
the 
firm 
intention 
of 
proposing. 
Julie 
met
him 
in 
a 
gay, 
careless 
manner, 
spoke 
casually 
of 
how 
she 
had 
enjoyed
yesterday's 
ball, 
and 
asked 
when 
he 
was 
leaving. 
Though 
Boris 
had
come 
intentionally 
to 
speak 
of 
his 
love

only 
to

the 
Rostovs 
arrived

the 
pulley 
of
the 
hall 
door 
squeaked 
from 
the 
cold 
as 
it 
let 
in 
the 
Rostovs

Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
with

Dolokhov

from

with
his

"Now

"More,

What's

Dolokhov 
did 
not

the

he 
had 
been 
drawn 
into 
a 
hot
dispute 
with 
the 
French 
grenadier. 
They 
were 
naturally 
talking 
about 
the
campaign. 
The 
Frenchman, 
confusing 
the 
Austrians 
with 
the 
Russians, 
was
trying 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
Russians 
had 
surrendered 
and 
had 
fled 
all
the 
way 
from 
Ulm, 
while 
Dolokhov 
maintained

not

had 
beaten

French.

"We

said 
Dolokhov.

"Only

CHAPTER 
VI

The 
fifth 
of 
November 
was 
the 
first 
day 
of 
what 
is 
called 
the 
battle 
of
Krasnoe. 
Toward 
evening-after 
much 
disputing 
and 
many 
mistakes 
made 
by
generals 
who 
did 
not 
go 
to 
their 
proper 
places, 
and 
after 
adjutants 
had
been 
sent 
about 
with 
counterorders-when 
it 
had 
become 
plain 
that 
the
enemy 
was 
everywhere 
in 
flight 
and 
that 
there 
could 
and 
would 
be 
no
battle, 
Kutuzov 
left 
Krasnoe 
and 
went<p>
to 
Dobroe 
whither 
his 
headquarters
had 
that 
day 
been 
transferred.

The 
day 
was 
clear 
and 
frosty. 
Kutuzov 
rode 
to 
Dobroe 
on 
his 
plump 
little
white 
horse, 
followed 
by 
an 
enormous 
suite 
of 
discontented 
generals 
who
whispered 
among 
themselves 
behind 
his 
back. 
All 
along 
the 
road 
groups 
of
French 
prisoners 
captured 
that 
day 
(there 
were 
seven 
thousand 
of 
them)
were 
crowding 
to 
warm 
themselves 
at 
campfires. 
Near 
Dobroe 
an 
immense
crowd 
of 
tattered 
prisoners, 
buzzing 
with 
talk 
and 
wrapped 
and 
bandaged
in 
anything 
they 
had 
been 
able 
to 
get 
hold 
of, 
were 
standing 
in 
the 
road
beside 
a 
long 
row 
of 
unharnessed 
French 
guns. 
At 
the<p>
approach<p>
of 
the
commander 
in 
chief 
the 
buzz 
of 
talk 
ceased 
and 
all 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
on
Kutuzov 
who, 
wearing 
a<p>
white 
cap 
with 
a 
red 
band 
and 
a 
padded 
overcoat
that 
bulged 
on 
his 
round 
shoulders, 
moved 
slowly 
along 
the 
road 
on 
his
white 
horse. 
One 
of 
the 
generals 
was 
reporting 
to 
him 
where 
the 
guns 
and
prisoners 
had 
been 
captured.

Kutuzov 
seemed 
preoccupied 
and 
did 
not 
listen 
to 
what 
the 
general 
was
saying. 
He 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes 
with 
a 
dissatisfied 
look 
as 
he 
gazed
attentively 
and 
fixedly 
at 
these 
prisoners, 
who 
presented 
a 
specially
wretched 
appearance. 
Most 
of 
them 
were 
disfigured 
by 
frost-bitten 
noses
and 
cheeks, 
and 
nearly 
all 
had 
red, 
swollen 
and 
festering 
eyes.

One 
group 
of 
the 
French 
stood 
close 
to 
the 
road, 
and 
two 
of 
them, 
one 
of
whom 
had 
his 
face 
covered 
with 
sores, 
were 
tearing 
a 
piece 
of 
raw
flesh 
with 
their 
hands. 
There 
was 
something 
horrible 
and 
bestial 
in
the 
fleeting 
glance 
they 
threw 
at 
the 
riders 
and 
in 
the 
malevolent
expression 
with 
which, 
after 
a 
glance 
at 
Kutuzov, 
the 
soldier 
with 
the
sores 
immediately 
turned 
away 
and 
went 
on 
with<p>
what 
he 
was 
doing.

Kutuzov 
looked 
long 
and 
intently 
at 
these 
two 
soldiers. 
He 
puckered 
his
face, 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes, 
and 
pensively 
swayed 
his 
head. 
At 
another
spot 
he 
noticed 
a 
Russian 
soldier 
laughingly 
patting 
a 
Frenchman 
on 
the
shoulder, 
saying 
something 
to 
him 
in 
a 
friendly 
manner, 
and 
Kutuzov 
with
the 
same 
expression 
on 
his 
face 
again 
swayed 
his 
head.

"What 
were 
you 
saying?" 
he 
asked 
the 
general, 
who 
continuing 
his 
report
directed 
the 
commander 
in 
chief's 
attention 
to 
some 
standards 
captured
from 
the 
French 
and 
standing 
in 
front 
of 
the<p>
Preobrazhensk 
regiment.

"Ah, 
the 
standards!" 
said 
Kutuzov, 
evidently 
detaching 
himself 
with
difficulty 
from 
the 
thoughts 
that 
preoccupied 
him.

He 
looked 
about 
him 
absently. 
Thousands 
of 
eyes 
were 
looking 
at 
him 
from
all<p>
sides 
awaiting 
a 
word 
from 
him.

He 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
the 
Preobrazhensk 
regiment, 
sighed 
deeply, 
and
closed 
his 
eyes. 
One<p>
of 
his 
suite 
beckoned 
to 
the 
soldiers 
carrying
the 
standards 
to 
advance 
and 
surround 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
with 
them.
Kutuzov 
was 
silent 
for 
a 
few 
seconds 
and

"Well, 
sit</h1>down, 
sit 
down 
here. 
Let's 
have 
a 
talk," 
said 
Kutuzov. 
"It's
sad, 
very 
sad. 
But 
remember, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
that 
I 
am 
a 
father 
to 
you,
a 
second 
father...."

Prince 
Andrew 
told 
Kutuzov 
all 
he 
knew 
of 
his 
father's 
death, 
and 
what
he 
had 
seen 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
when 
he 
passed 
through 
it.

"What... 
what 
they 
have 
brought 
us 
to!" 
Kutuzov 
suddenly 
cried 
in 
an
agitated 
voice, 
evidently 
picturing 
vividly 
to 
himself 
from 
Prince
Andrew's 
story 
the 
condition 
Russia 
was 
in. 
"But 
give 
me 
time, 
give 
me
time!" 
he 
said 
with<p>
a<p>
grim 
look, 
evidently 
not 
wishing 
to 
continue 
this
agitating 
conversation, 
and 
added: 
"I 
sent 
for 
you 
to 
keep 
you 
with 
me."

"I 
thank 
your 
Serene 
Highness, 
but 
I 
fear 
I 
am 
no 
longer 
fit 
for 
the
staff," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
a 
smile 
which 
Kutuzov 
noticed.

Kutuzov 
glanced 
inquiringly 
at 
him.

"But 
above 
all," 
added 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"I 
have 
grown 
used 
to 
my 
regiment,
am 
fond 
of 
the 
officers, 
and 
I 
fancy 
the 
men 
also 
like 
me. 
I 
should 
be
sorry 
to 
leave<p>
the 
regiment. 
If 
I 
decline 
the 
honor 
of 
being 
with 
you,
believe 
me..."

A 
shrewd, 
kindly, 
yet 
subtly 
derisive 
expression 
lit 
up 
Kutuzov's 
podgy
face. 
He 
cut 
Bolkonski 
short.

"I 
am 
sorry, 
for 
I 
need 
you. 
But 
you're 
right, 
you're 
right! 
It's 
not
here 
that 
men 
are 
needed. 
Advisers 
are 
always 
plentiful, 
but 
men 
are
not. 
The 
regiments 
would 
not 
be 
what 
they 
are 
if 
the 
would-be 
advisers
served 
there 
as 
you 
do. 
I 
remember 
you 
at 
Austerlitz.... 
I 
remember,
yes, 
I 
remember 
you 
with 
the 
standard!" 
said 
Kutuzov, 
and 
a 
flush<p>
of
pleasure 
suffused 
Prince 
Andrew's 
face 
at 
this 
recollection.

Taking 
his 
hand 
and 
drawing 
him 
downwards, 
Kutuzov 
offered 
his 
cheek 
to
be 
kissed, 
and 
again 
Prince 
Andrew 
noticed 
tears 
in 
the 
old 
man's 
eyes.
Though 
Prince 
Andrew 
knew 
that 
<a href="/cZl/eg3FX45.html">Kutuzov's</a> 
tears 
came 
easily, 
and 
that 
he
was 
particularly 
tender 
to 
and 
considerate 
of 
him 
from 
a 
wish 
to
show 
sympathy 
with 
his 
loss, 
yet 
this 
reminder 
of 
Austerlitz 
was 
both
pleasant 
and 
flattering 
to 
him.

"Go 
your 
way 
and 
God 
be 
with 
you. 
I 
know 
your 
path 
is 
the 
path 
of
honor!" 
He 
paused. 
"I 
missed 
you 
at 
Bucharest, 
but 
I 
needed 
someone 
to
send." 
And 
changing 
the 
subject, 
Kutuzov 
began 
to 
speak<p>
of 
the 
Turkish
war 
and 
the 
peace 
that 
had 
been 
concluded. 
"Yes, 
I 
have 
been 
much
blamed," 
he 
said, 
"both 
for 
that 
war 
and 
the 
peace... 
but 
everything
came 
at 
the 
right 
time.

*
And 
there 
were 
as 
many 
advisers 
there 
as 
here..." 
he 
went 
on, 
returning
to 
the 
subject 
of 
"advisers" 
which 
evidently 
occupied 
him. 
"Ah, 
those
advisers!" 
said 
he. 
"If 
we 
had 
listened 
to 
them 
all 
we 
should 
not 
have
made<p>
peace 
with 
Turkey 
and 
should 
not 
have

died; 
and
next 
day 
a 
throng 
of 
acquaintances 
who 
came 
to 
pay 
their 
last 
respects
to 
the 
deceased 
filled 
the 
house 
rented<p>
by 
the 
Rostovs. 
All 
these
acquaintances, 
who 
had 
so 
often 
dined 
and 
danced 
at 
his 
house 
and 
had 
so
often 
laughed 
at 
him, 
now 
said, 
with 
a 
common 
feeling 
of 
self-reproach
and 
emotion, 
as 
if 
justifying 
themselves: 
"Well, 
whatever 
he 
may 
have
been 
he 
was 
a 
most 
worthy 
man. 
You 
don't 
meet 
such 
men 
nowadays.... 
And
which 
of 
us 
has 
not 
weaknesses 
of 
his 
own?"

It 
was 
just 
when 
the 
count's 
affairs 
had 
become 
so 
involved 
that 
it 
was
impossible 
to 
say 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
he 
lived 
another 
year 
that 
he
unexpectedly 
died.

Nicholas 
was 
with 
the 
Russian 
army 
in 
Paris 
when 
the 
news 
of 
his
father's 
death 
reached 
him. 
He 
at 
once 
resigned 
his 
commission, 
and
without 
waiting 
for 
it 
to 
be 
accepted<p>
took 
leave 
of 
absence 
and 
went 
to
Moscow. 
The 
state 
of 
the 
count's 
affairs 
became 
quite 
obvious 
a 
month
after 
his 
death, 
surprising 
everyone 
by 
the 
immense 
total 
of 
small
debts 
the 
existence 
of 
which 
no 
one 
had 
suspected. 
The 
debts 
amounted 
to
double 
the 
value 
of 
the 
property.

Friends 
and 
relations 
advised 
Nicholas 
to 
decline 
the 
inheritance. 
But
he 
regarded 
such 
a 
refusal 
as 
a 
slur 
on 
his 
father's 
memory, 
which 
he
held 
sacred, 
and 
therefore 
would 
not 
hear 
of 
refusing 
and 
accepted 
the
inheritance 
together 
with 
the 
obligation 
to 
pay 
the 
debts.

The 
creditors 
who 
had 
so 
long 
been 
silent, 
restrained 
by 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">vague
but</a> 
powerful 
influence 
exerted 
on 
them 
while 
he 
lived 
by 
the 
count's
careless 
good 
nature, 
all 
proceeded 
to 
enforce 
their 
claims 
at 
once. 
As
always 
happens 
in 
such 
cases 
rivalry 
sprang 
up 
as 
to 
which 
should 
get
paid 
first, 
and 
those 
who 
like 
Mitenka 
held 
promissory 
notes 
given 
them
as 
presents 
now 
became 
the 
most 
exacting 
of 
the 
creditors. 
Nicholas 
was
allowed 
no 
respite 
and 
no 
peace, 
and 
those 
who 
had 
seemed 
to 
pity
the 
old 
man-the 
cause 
of 
their 
losses 
(if 
they 
were 
losses)-now
remorselessly 
pursued 
the 
young 
heir 
who 
had 
voluntarily 
undertaken 
the
debts 
and 
was 
obviously 
not 
guilty 
of 
contracting 
them.

Not 
one 
of 
the 
plans 
Nicholas 
tried 
succeeded; 
the 
estate 
was 
sold 
by
auction 
for 
half 
its 
value, 
and 
half 
the 
debts 
still 
remained
unpaid. 
Nicholas 
accepted 
thirty 
thousand 
rubles 
offered 
him 
by 
his
brother-in-law 
Bezukhov 
to 
pay 
off 
debts 
he 
regarded 
as 
genuinely 
due
for 
value 
received. 
And 
to 
avoid 
being 
imprisoned 
for 
the<p>
remainder, 
as
the 
creditors 
threatened, 
he 
re-entered 
the 
government 
service.

He 
could 
not 
rejoin 
the 
army 
where 
he 
would 
have 
been 
made 
colonel 
at
the 
next 
vacancy, 
for 
his 
mother 
now 
clung 
to 
him 
as 
her 
one 
hold 
on
life;<p>
and 
so 
despite 
his 
reluctance<p>
to 
remain 
in 
Moscow 
among 
people 
who
had 
known 
him 
before, 
and 
despite 
his 
abhorrence 
of 
the 
civil 
service,
he 
accepted 
a 
post 
in 
Moscow 
in 
that 
service, 
doffed 
the 
uniform 
of
which 
he 
was 
so 
fond, 
and 
moved 
with 
his 
mother 
and 
Sonya 
to 
a 
small
house 
on 
the 
Sivtsev 
Vrazhok.

Natasha 
and 
Pierre 
were 
living 
in 
Petersburg 
at 
the 
time 
and 
had 
no
clear 
idea 
of 
Nicholas' 
circumstances. 
Having 
borrowed 
money 
from 
his
brother-in-law, 
Nicholas 
tried 
to 
hide 
his 
wretched 
condition 
from 
him.
His 
position 
was 
the 
more 
difficult 
because 
with 
his 
salary 
of 
twelve
hundred 
rubles 
he 
had 
not 
only 
to 
keep 
himself, 
his 
mother, 
and 
Sonya,
but 
had 
to 
shield 
his 
mother 
from 
knowledge 
of 
their 
poverty. 
The
countess 
could 
not 
conceive 
of 
life 
without 
the 
luxurious 
conditions 
she
had 
been 
used 
to 
from 
childhood 
and, 
unable 
to

CHAPTER 
VIII

Sonya's 
letter 
written 
from 
Troitsa, 
which 
had 
come 
as 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/na1l2Eh2zNkID.html">an</a> 
answer 
to
Nicholas' 
prayer, 
was 
prompted 
by 
this: 
the 
thought 
of 
getting 
Nicholas
married 
to 
an 
heiress 
occupied 
the 
old 
countess' 
mind 
more 
and 
more. 
She
knew 
that 
Sonya 
was 
the 
chief 
obstacle 
to 
this 
happening, 
and 
Sonya's
life 
in 
the 
countess' 
house 
had 
grown 
harder 
and 
harder, 
especially
after 
they 
had 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Nicholas 
telling 
of 
his 
meeting
with 
Princess 
Mary 
in 
Bogucharovo. 
The 
countess 
let 
no 
occasion 
slip 
of
making 
humiliating 
or 
cruel 
allusions 
to 
Sonya.

But 
a 
few 
days 
before 
they 
left 
Moscow, 
moved 
and 
excited 
by 
all 
that
was 
going 
on, 
she<p>
called 
Sonya 
to 
her 
and, 
instead 
of 
reproaching 
and
making 
demands 
on 
her, 
tearfully 
implored 
her 
to 
sacrifice 
herself
and 
repay 
all 
that 
the 
family 
had 
done 
for 
her 
by 
breaking 
off 
her
engagement 
with 
Nicholas.

"I 
shall 
not 
be 
at 
peace 
till 
you 
promise 
me 
this."

Sonya 
burst 
into 
hysterical 
tears 
and 
replied 
through 
her 
sobs 
that
she 
would 
do 
anything 
and 
was 
prepared 
for 
anything, 
but 
gave 
no 
actual
promise 
and 
could 
not 
bring 
herself 
to 
decide 
to 
do 
what 
was 
demanded
of 
her. 
She 
must 
sacrifice 
herself 
for 
the 
family 
that 
had 
reared 
and
brought 
her 
up. 
To 
sacrifice 
herself 
for 
others 
was 
Sonya's 
habit. 
Her
position 
in 
the 
house 
was 
such 
that 
only 
by 
sacrifice 
could 
she 
show 
her
worth, 
and 
she 
was 
accustomed 
to 
this 
and 
loved 
doing 
it. 
But<p>
in 
all 
her
former 
acts 
of 
self-sacrifice 
she 
had 
been 
happily 
conscious

wanted 
to 
pass
over 
the 
horrible 
details, 
but 
Natasha 
insisted 
that 
he 
should 
not 
omit
anything.

Pierre 
began 
to 
tell 
about 
Karataev, 
but 
paused. 
By 
this 
time 
he 
had
risen 
from 
the 
table 
and 
was 
pacing 
the 
room, 
Natasha 
following 
him 
with
her 
eyes. 
Then 
he 
added:

"No, 
you 
can't 
understand 
what 
I 
learned 
from 
that 
illiterate 
man-that
simple 
fellow."

"Yes, 
yes, 
go 
on!" 
said 
Natasha. 
"Where 
is 
he?"

"They 
killed 
him 
almost 
before 
my 
eyes."

And 
Pierre, 
his 
voice 
trembling 
continually, 
went 
on 
to 
tell 
of 
the 
last
days 
of 
their 
retreat, 
of 
Karataev's 
illness 
and 
his 
death.

He 
told 
of 
his 
adventures 
as 
he 
had 
never 
yet 
recalled 
them. 
He 
now, 
as
it 
were, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Xs7HAb8Wu7IQlv.html">saw</a> 
a 
new 
meaning 
in 
all 
he 
had 
gone 
through. 
Now 
that 
he 
was
telling 
it 
all 
to<p>
Natasha 
he 
experienced 
that 
pleasure 
which 
a 
man 
has
when 
women 
listen 
to 
him-not 
clever 
women 
who 
when 
listening 
either 
try
to 
remember 
what 
they 
hear 
to 
enrich 
their<p>
minds 
and 
when 
opportunity
offers 
to 
retell 
it, 
or 
who 
wish 
to 
adopt 
it 
to 
some 
thought 
of 
their
own 
and 
promptly 
contribute 
their 
own 
clever 
comments 
prepared 
in 
their
little 
mental 
workshop-but 
the 
pleasure 
given 
by 
real 
women 
gifted 
with
a 
capacity 
to 
select 
and 
absorb 
the 
very 
best 
a 
man 
shows 
of 
himself.
Natasha 
without 
knowing 
it 
was 
all 
attention: 
she 
did 
not 
lose 
a 
word,
no 
single 
quiver 
in 
Pierre's 
voice, 
no 
look, 
no 
twitch 
of 
a 
muscle 
in
his 
face, 
nor 
a 
single 
gesture. 
She 
caught 
the 
unfinished 
word 
in 
its
flight 
and 
took 
it 
straight 
into 
her 
open 
heart, 
divining 
the 
secret
meaning 
of 
all 
Pierre's 
mental 
travail.

Princess 
Mary 
understood 
his 
story 
and 
sympathized 
with 
him, 
but 
she
now 
saw 
something 
else 
that 
absorbed 
all 
her 
attention. 
She 
saw 
the
possibility 
of 
love 
and 
happiness 
between 
Natasha 
and 
Pierre, 
and 
the
first 
thought 
of 
this 
filled 
<a href="/aVzUge/NhF8l41x.html">her</a> 
heart 
with 
gladness.

It 
was 
three 
o'clock 
in 
the 
morning. 
The 
footmen 
came 
in 
with 
sad 
and
stern 
faces 
to 
change 
the 
candles, 
but 
no 
one 
noticed 
them.

Pierre 
finished 
his 
story. 
Natasha 
continued 
to 
look 
at 
him 
intently
with 
bright, 
attentive, 
and 
animated 
eyes, 
as 
if 
trying 
to 
understand
something 
more 
which 
he 
had 
perhaps 
left 
untold. 
Pierre 
in<p>
shamefaced
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Li3a6l4X.html">happy</a> 
confusion 
<a href="/cZl/kW5XT8UHdX0aJoR.html">glanced</a> 
occasionally 
at 
her, 
and 
tried 
to 
think 
what
to 
say 
next 
to 
introduce 
a 
fresh 
subject. 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
silent.

following 
sharply 
defined
subdivisions 
of 
tendencies</h1>and 
parties:

The 
first 
party 
consisted 
of 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents-military 
theorists
who 
believed 
in 
a 
science 
of 
war 
with 
immutable 
laws-laws 
of 
oblique
movements, 
outflankings, 
and 
so 
forth. 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents 
demanded
a 
retirement 
into 
the 
depths 
of<p>
the 
country 
in 
accordance 
with 
precise
laws 
defined 
by 
a 
pseudo-theory 
of 
war, 
and 
they 
saw 
only 
barbarism,
ignorance, 
or 
evil 
intention 
in 
every 
deviation 
from 
that 
theory. 
To
this 
party 
belonged 
the 
foreign 
nobles, 
Wolzogen, 
Wintzingerode, 
and
others, 
chiefly 
Germans.

The 
second 
party 
was 
directly 
opposed 
to 
the<p>
first; 
one 
extreme, 
as
always 
happens, 
was 
met 
by 
representatives 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/ce5sbb6XKBx4bKMVG.html">the</a> 
other. 
The 
members 
of
this 
party 
were 
those 
who 
had 
demanded 
an 
advance 
from 
Vilna 
into 
Poland
and 
freedom 
from 
all 
prearranged 
plans. 
Besides 
being 
advocates 
of 
bold
action, 
this 
section 
also 
represented 
nationalism, 
which 
made 
them 
still
more 
one-sided 
in 
the 
dispute. 
They 
were 
Russians: 
Bagration, 
Ermolov
(who 
was 
beginning 
to 
come 
to 
the 
front), 
and 
others. 
At 
that 
time 
a
famous 
joke 
of 
Ermolov's 
was 
being 
circulated, 
that 
as 
a 
great 
favor 
he
had 
petitioned 
the 
Emperor 
to 
make 
him 
a 
German. 
The 
men 
of 
that 
party,
remembering 
Suvorov, 
said 
that 
what 
one 
had 
to 
do 
was 
not 
to 
reason,
or 
stick 
pins 
into 
maps, 
but 
to 
fight, 
beat 
the 
enemy, 
keep 
him 
out 
of
Russia, 
and 
not 
let 
the 
army 
get 
discouraged.

To 
the 
third 
party-in 
which 
the 
Emperor 
had 
most<p>
confidence-belonged 
the
courtiers 
<a href="/aVzUge/bh1zNkID7Gmw.html">who</a> 
tried 
to 
arrange 
compromises 
between 
the 
other 
two. 
The
members 
of 
this 
party, 
chiefly 
civilians 
and 
to 
whom 
Arakcheev 
belonged,
thought 
and 
said 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">what</a> 
men 
who 
have 
no 
convictions 
but 
wish 
to 
seem 
to
have 
some 
generally 
say. 
They 
said 
that 
undoubtedly 
war,<p>
particularly
against<p>
such 
a 
genius 
as 
Bonaparte 
(they 
called 
him 
Bonaparte 
now),
needs 
most 
deeply 
devised 
plans 
and 
profound 
scientific 
knowledge 
and
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/qK8Gj93kBL.html">that</a> 
respect 
Pfuel 
was 
a 
genius, 
but 
at 
the 
same 
time 
it 
had 
to 
be
acknowledged 
that 
the 
theorists 
are 
often 
one-sided, 
and 
therefore 
one
should 
not 
trust 
them 
absolutely, 
but 
should 
also 
listen 
to 
what 
Pfuel's
opponents 
and 
practical 
men 
of 
experience 
in 
warfare 
had 
to 
say, 
and
then 
choose 
a 
middle 
course. 
They 
insisted 
on 
the 
retention 
of 
the 
camp
at<p>
Drissa, 
according 
to 
Pfuel's 
plan, 
but 
on 
changing 
the 
movements 
of
the 
other 
armies. 
Though, 
by 
this 
course, 
neither 
one 
aim 
nor 
the 
other
could 
be 
attained, 
yet 
it 
seemed 
best 
to 
the 
adherents 
of 
this 
third
party.

Of 
a 
fourth 
opinion 
the 
most 
conspicuous 
representative 
was 
the
Tsarevich, 
who 
could 
not 
forget 
his 
disillusionment 
at 
Austerlitz, 
where
he 
had 
ridden 
out 
at 
the 
head 
of 
the 
Guards, 
in 
his 
casque 
and 
cavalry
uniform 
as 
to 
a 
review, 
expecting 
to 
crush 
the 
French 
gallantly; 
but
unexpectedly 
finding 
himself 
in 
the 
front 
line 
had 
narrowly 
escaped 
amid
the 
general 
confusion. 
The 
men<p>
of 
this 
party 
had 
both 
the 
quality
and 
the 
defect 
of 
frankness 
in 
their 
opinions. 
They 
feared 
Napoleon,
recognized 
his 
strength 
and 
their 
own 
weakness, 
and 
frankly 
said 
so.
They 
said: 
"Nothing 
but 
sorrow, 
shame, 
and 
ruin 
will 
come 
of 
all 
this!
We 
have 
abandoned 
Vilna 
and 
Vitebsk 
and 
shall 
abandon 
Drissa. 
The 
only
reasonable 
thing 
left 
to 
do 
is 
to 
conclude 
peace 
as 
soon 
as 
possible,
before 
we 
are 
turned 
out 
of 
Petersburg."

This 
view 
was 
very 
general 
in 
the 
upper 
army 
circles 
and 
found 
support
also 
in 
Petersburg 
and 
from 
the 
chancellor, 
Rumyantsev, 
who, 
for 
other
reasons 
of 
state, 
was 
in 
favor 
of 
peace.

The 
fifth 
party 
consisted 
of 
those 
who 
were 
adherents 
of 
Barclay 
de
Tolly, 
not 
so 
much 
as 
a 
man 
but 
as 
minister 
of 
war 
and 
commander<p>
in
chief. 
"Be 
he 
what 
he 
may" 
(they 
always 
began 
like 
that), 
"he 
is 
an
honest, 
practical 
man 
and 
we 
have 
nobody<p>
better. 
Give 
him 
real 
power,

<a href="/aVzUge/zl36Jk9rP.html">to</a>

being 
due 
to 
profound
considerations. 
Similarly 
profound 
considerations 
are 
given 
for
his 
retreat 
from 
Smolensk 
to 
Orsha. 
Then 
his 
heroism 
at 
Krasnoe 
is
described, 
where 
he 
is 
reported 
to 
have 
been 
prepared 
to 
accept 
battle
and 
take 
personal 
command, 
and 
to 
have 
walked 
about 
with 
a 
birch 
stick
and 
said:

"J'ai 
assez 
fait 
l'empereur; 
il 
est 
temps 
de 
faire 
le 
general," 
<a href="/cZl/Zdn31xHdu.html">*</a> 
but
nevertheless 
immediately 
ran 
away 
again, 
abandoning 
to 
its 
fate 
the
scattered 
fragments 
of 
the 
army<p>
he 
left 
behind.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"I

is 
time 
to

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hI3tc2BnCGW3iLv.html">the</a> 
general."


Then 
we 
are 
told 
of 
the 
greatness 
of 
soul 
of 
the 
marshals, 
especially
of 
Ney-a 
greatness 
of 
soul 
consisting 
in 
this: 
that 
he 
made 
his 
way 
by
night 
around 
through 
the 
forest 
and 
across 
the 
Dnieper 
and 
escaped 
to
Orsha, 
abandoning 
standards, 
artillery, 
and 
nine 
tenths 
of 
his 
men.

And 
lastly, 
the 
final 
departure 
of 
the 
great 
Emperor 
from 
his 
heroic
army 
is 
presented 
to 
us 
by 
the 
historians 
as 
something 
great 
and
characteristic 
of 
genius. 
Even 
that 
final 
running 
away, 
described 
in
ordinary 
language 
as 
the 
lowest 
depth 
of 
baseness 
which 
every 
child
is 
taught 
to 
be 
ashamed 
of-even 
that 
act 
finds 
justification 
in 
the
historians' 
language.

When 
it 
is 
impossible 
to 
stretch 
the 
very 
elastic 
threads 
of 
historical
ratiocination 
any 
farther, 
when 
actions 
are 
clearly 
contrary 
to 
all
that 
humanity 
calls 
right 
or 
even 
just, 
the 
historians 
produce 
a 
saving
conception 
of 
"greatness." 
"Greatness," 
it 
seems, 
excludes 
the 
standards
of 
right 
and 
wrong. 
For 
the 
"great" 
man 
nothing 
is 
wrong, 
there 
is 
no
atrocity 
for 
which 
a 
"great" 
man 
can 
be

only 
"grand" 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UJ1pbE40b.html">and</a> 
"not

Grand 
is 
good, 
not

is 
bad. 
Grand 
is 
the

in 
their 
conception, 
of

Thiers, 
narrating 
this 
episode.</h1>In
reality 
Lavrushka, 
having 
got 
drunk 
the 
day 
before 
and 
left 
his 
master
dinnerless, 
had 
been 
whipped 
and 
sent 
to 
the 
village 
in 
quest 
of
chickens, 
where 
he 
engaged 
in 
looting 
till 
the 
French 
took 
him 
prisoner.
Lavrushka 
was 
one 
of 
those 
coarse, 
bare-faced 
lackeys 
who 
have 
seen 
all
sorts 
of 
things, 
consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
do 
everything 
in 
a 
mean 
and
cunning 
way, 
are 
ready 
to 
render 
any 
sort 
of 
service 
to 
their 
master,
and 
are 
keen 
at 
guessing 
their 
master's 
baser 
impulses, 
especially 
those
prompted 
by 
vanity 
and 
pettiness.

Finding 
himself 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Napoleon, 
whose 
identity 
he 
had 
easily
and 
surely 
recognized, 
Lavrushka 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
abashed 
but 
merely
did 
his 
utmost 
to 
gain 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/CX30.html">new</a> 
master's 
favor.

He 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
this 
was 
Napoleon, 
but 
Napoleon's 
presence 
could
no 
more 
intimidate 
him 
than 
Rostov's, 
or 
a 
sergeant 
major's 
with 
the
rods, 
would 
have 
done, 
for 
he 
had 
nothing 
that 
either 
the 
sergeant 
major
or 
Napoleon 
could 
deprive 
him 
of.

So 
he 
rattled 
on, 
telling 
all 
the 
gossip 
he 
had 
heard 
among 
the
orderlies. 
Much 
of 
it 
true. 
But 
when 
Napoleon 
asked 
him 
whether 
the
Russians 
thought 
they 
would 
beat 
Bonaparte<p>
or 
not, 
Lavrushka 
screwed 
up
his 
eyes 
and 
considered.

In 
this 
question 
he 
saw 
subtle 
cunning, 
as 
men 
of 
his 
type 
see 
cunning
in 
everything, 
so 
he 
frowned 
and 
did 
not 
answer 
immediately.

"It's 
like 
this," 
he 
said 
thoughtfully, 
"if 
there's 
a 
battle 
soon, 
yours
will 
win. 
That's 
right. 
But 
if 
three 
days 
pass, 
then 
after 
that, 
well,
then 
that 
same 
battle 
will 
not 
soon 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/pb9epgGc7M7G.html">be</a> 
over."

Lelorgne 
d'Ideville 
smilingly 
interpreted 
this 
speech 
to 
Napoleon 
thus:
"If 
a 
battle 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
next 
three 
days 
the 
French 
will
win, 
but<p>
if 
later, 
God 
knows 
what 
will 
happen." 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
smile,
though 
he 
was 
evidently 
in 
high 
good 
humor, 
and 
he 
ordered 
<a href="/cZl/pM8O1Xs.html">these</a> 
words
to 
be 
repeated.

Lavrushka 
noticed 
this 
and 
to 
entertain 
him 
further, 
pretending 
not 
to
know 
who 
Napoleon 
was, 
<a href="/cZl/Im8jbFN5O6ACoNJ.html">added:

"We</a> 
know 
that 
you 
have 
Bonaparte 
and 
that 
he 
has 
beaten 
everybody 
in 
the
world, 
but 
we 
are 
a 
different 
matter..."-without 
knowing 
why 
or 
how 
this
bit 
of 
boastful 
patriotism<p>
slipped 
out 
at 
the 
end.

The 
interpreter 
translated 
these 
words 
without 
the 
last 
phrase, 
and
Bonaparte 
smiled. 
"The 
young 
Cossack 
made 
his 
mighty 
interlocutor
smile," 
says 
Thiers. 
After 
riding 
a 
few 
paces 
in 
silence, 
Napoleon
turned 
to 
Berthier 
and 
said 
he 
wished 
to 
see 
how

news 
that 
he 
was

Emperor

continued

When 
the

the

cleared 
away 
the 
broken

and 
everybody
sat 
down 
again, 
smiling 
at 
the

exchanging

The

a 
squad 
of 
soldiers 
arrived 
and 
Pierre 
with
thirteen 
others 
was 
led 
to 
the 
Virgin's 
Field. 
It 
was 
a 
fine 
day, 
sunny
after 
rain, 
and 
the 
air 
was 
unusually 
pure. 
The 
smoke 
did 
not 
hang 
low
as 
on 
the 
day 
when 
Pierre 
had 
been 
taken 
from 
the 
guardhouse 
on 
the
Zubovski 
rampart, 
but 
rose 
through 
the 
pure 
air 
in 
columns. 
No 
flames
were 
seen, 
but 
columns<p>
of 
smoke 
rose 
on 
all 
sides, 
and 
all 
Moscow<p>
as 
far
as 
Pierre 
could 
see 
was 
one 
vast 
charred 
ruin. 
On 
all 
sides 
there 
were
waste 
spaces 
with 
only 
stoves 
and 
chimney 
stacks 
still 
standing, 
and
here 
and 
there 
the 
blackened 
walls 
of 
some 
brick 
houses. 
Pierre 
gazed
at 
the 
ruins 
and 
did 
not 
recognize 
districts 
he 
had 
known 
well. 
Here 
and
there 
he 
could 
see 
churches 
that 
had 
not 
been 
burned. 
The 
Kremlin, 
which
was 
not 
destroyed, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">gleamed</a> 
white 
in 
the 
distance 
with 
its 
towers 
and
the 
belfry 
of 
Ivan 
the 
Great. 
The 
domes 
of 
the 
New 
Convent 
of 
the 
Virgin
glittered 
brightly 
and 
its 
bells 
were 
ringing 
particularly 
clearly.
These 
bells 
reminded 
Pierre 
that 
it 
was 
Sunday 
and 
the 
feast 
of 
the
Nativity 
of 
the 
Virgin. 
But 
there 
seemed 
to 
be 
no 
one 
to 
celebrate 
this
holiday: 
everywhere 
were 
blackened 
ruins, 
and 
the 
few 
Russians 
to 
be
seen 
were<p>
tattered 
and 
frightened 
people 
who 
tried 
to 
hide 
when 
they 
saw
the 
French.

It 
was 
plain 
that 
the 
Russian 
<a href="/cZl/Wj2NDX9oP3vuxZ.html">nest</a> 
was 
ruined 
and 
destroyed, 
but 
in
place 
of<p>
the 
Russian 
order 
of 
life 
that 
had 
been 
destroyed, 
Pierre
unconsciously 
felt 
that 
a 
quite 
different, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kI50jl0AHAK.html">firm,</a> 
French 
order 
had 
been
established 
over 
this 
ruined 
nest. 
He 
felt 
this 
in 
the 
looks 
of
the 
soldiers 
who, 
marching 
in 
regular 
ranks 
briskly 
and 
gaily, 
were
escorting 
him 
and 
the 
other 
criminals; 
he 
felt 
it 
in 
the 
looks 
of 
an
important 
French 
official 
in 
a 
carriage 
and 
pair 
driven 
by 
a 
soldier,
whom 
they 
met 
on 
the 
way. 
He 
felt 
it 
in 
the 
merry 
sounds 
of 
regimental
music 
he 
heard 
from 
the 
left 
side 
of 
the 
field, 
and 
felt 
and 
realized
it 
especially 
from 
the 
list 
of 
prisoners 
the 
French 
officer 
had 
read 
out
when 
he 
came 
that 
morning.<p>
Pierre 
had 
been 
taken 
by 
one 
set 
of 
soldiers
and 
led 
first 
to 
one 
and 
then 
to 
another 
place 
with 
dozens 
of 
other 
men,
and 
it 
seemed 
that 
they 
might 
have 
forgotten 
him, 
or 
confused 
him 
with
the 
others. 
But 
no: 
the 
answers 
he 
had 
given 
when 
questioned 
had 
come
back 
to 
him 
in 
his 
designation 
as 
"the 
man 
who 
does 
not 
give 
his 
name,"
and 
under 
that 
appellation, 
which 
to 
Pierre 
seemed 
terrible, 
they 
were
now 
leading<p>
him 
somewhere 
with 
unhesitating 
assurance 
on 
their 
faces
that 
he 
and 
all 
the 
other 
prisoners 
<a href="/aVzUge/iO5ieowf7qUgk2AzQCY.html">were</a> 
exactly 
the 
ones 
they 
wanted
and 
that 
they 
were 
being 
taken 
to 
the 
proper 
place. 
Pierre 
felt 
himself
to 
be 
an 
insignificant 
chip 
fallen 
among 
the 
wheels 
of 
a 
machine 
whose
action 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
but 
which 
was 
working 
well.

He 
and 
the 
other 
prisoners 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
right 
side 
of 
the 
Virgin's
Field, 
to 
a 
large 
white 
house 
with 
an 
immense 
garden 
not 
far 
from 
the
convent. 
This 
was 
Prince 
Shcherbatov's 
house, 
where 
Pierre 
had 
often
been 
in 
other 
days, 
and 
which, 
as 
he 
learned 
from 
the 
talk 
of 
the
soldiers, 
was 
now 
occupied 
by 
the 
marshal, 
the 
Duke 
of 
Eckmuehl 
(Davout).

They 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
entrance 
and 
led 
into 
the 
house 
one 
by 
one.
Pierre 
was 
the 
sixth 
to 
enter. 
He 
was 
conducted 
through 
a 
glass 
gallery,
an 
anteroom, 
and 
a 
hall,

there. 
He 
had
gone 
to 
Petersburg, 
but 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
glad 
to 
hear 
this. 
His 
mind
was 
occupied 
by 
the 
interests 
of 
the 
center 
that 
was 
conducting
a 
gigantic 
war, 
and 
he 
was 
glad 
to 
be 
free 
for 
a 
while 
from 
the
distraction 
caused 
by 
the 
thought 
of 
Kuragin. 
During 
the 
<a href="/cZl/IH5S3rP1L.html">first</a> 
four
days, 
while 
no 
duties 
were 
required 
of 
him, 
Prince 
Andrew 
rode 
round 
the
whole 
fortified 
camp 
and, 
by 
the<p>
aid 
of 
his 
own 
knowledge 
and 
by
talks 
with 
experts, 
tried 
to 
form 
a 
definite 
opinion 
about 
it. 
But 
the
question 
whether 
the 
camp 
was 
advantageous 
or 
disadvantageous 
remained
for 
him 
undecided. 
Already 
from 
his 
military 
experience 
and 
what 
he 
had
seen 
in 
the 
Austrian 
campaign, 
he 
had 
come 
to 
the 
conclusion 
that 
in
war 
the 
most 
deeply 
considered 
plans 
have 
no 
significance 
and 
that 
all
depends 
on 
the 
way 
unexpected 
movements 
of 
the 
enemy-that 
cannot 
be
foreseen-are 
met, 
and 
on 
how 
and 
by 
whom 
the 
whole 
matter 
is 
handled.
To 
clear 
up 
this 
last 
point 
for 
himself, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
utilizing 
his
position 
and 
acquaintances, 
tried 
to 
fathom 
the 
character 
of 
the 
control
of 
the 
army 
and 
of 
the 
men 
and 
parties 
engaged 
in 
it, 
and 
he 
deduced 
for
himself 
the 
following 
of 
the 
state 
of 
affairs.

While 
the 
Emperor 
had 
still 
been 
at 
Vilna, 
the 
forces 
had 
been 
divided
into 
three 
armies. 
First, 
the 
army 
under 
Barclay 
de 
Tolly, 
secondly, 
<a href="/cZl/SNe5NX8bZDWZ7UhXdK.html">the
army</a> 
under 
Bagration,<p>
and 
thirdly, 
the 
one 
commanded 
by 
Tormasov. 
The
Emperor 
was 
with 
the 
first 
army, 
but 
not 
as 
commander 
in 
chief. 
In 
the
orders 
issued 
it 
<a href="/aVzUge/on4s8bOIDr7iGjCy.html">was</a> 
stated, 
not 
that 
the 
Emperor 
would 
take 
command,
but 
only 
that 
he 
would 
be 
with 
the 
army. 
The 
Emperor, 
moreover, 
had
with 
him 
not 
a 
commander 
in 
chief's 
staff 
but 
the 
imperial 
headquarters
staff. 
In 
attendance 
on 
him 
was 
the 
head 
of 
the 
imperial 
staff,
Quartermaster 
General 
Prince 
Volkonski, 
as 
well 
as 
generals, 
imperial
aides-de-camp, 
diplomatic 
officials, 
and 
a 
large 
number 
of<p>
foreigners,
but 
not 
the 
army 
staff. 
Besides 
these, 
there 
were 
in 
attendance 
on 
the
Emperor 
without 
any 
definite 
appointments: 
Arakcheev, 
the 
ex-Minister
of 
War; 
Count 
Bennigsen, 
the 
senior 
general 
in 
rank; 
the 
Grand 
Duke
Tsarevich 
Constantine 
Pavlovich; 
Count 
Rumyantsev, 
the 
Chancellor;
Stein, 
a 
former 
Prussian 
minister; 
Armfeldt, 
a 
Swedish 
general; 
Pfuel,
the 
chief 
author 
of 
the 
plan 
of 
campaign; 
Paulucci, 
an 
adjutant 
general
and 
Sardinian 
emigre; 
Wolzogen-and 
many 
others. 
Though 
these 
men 
had 
no
military 
appointment 
in 
the 
<a href="/cZl/AXs2Z0uFRs2pufMC.html">army,</a>

The 
German

hearing 
Rostov's 
loud
voice, 
popped 
her 
head 
in 
at 
the 
door.

"Eh, 
is 
she 
pretty?" 
he 
asked 
with 
a

"Why 
do

so? 
You'll 
frighten

said 
Boris. 
"I 
did
not

today," 
he 
added. 
"I 
only

you 
the 
note 
yesterday
by 
Bolkonski-an 
adjutant 
of 
Kutuzov's, 
who's 
a 
friend 
of 
mine.
I 
did 
not

he 
would 
get 
it 
to

so 
quickly.... 
Well, 
how 
are 
you?
Been 
under 
fire 
already?" 
asked 
Boris.

Without 
answering, 
Rostov 
shook 
the 
soldier's 
Cross 
of 
St. 
George
fastened 
to 
the 
cording 
of 
his 
uniform 
and, 
indicating 
a 
bandaged 
arm,
glanced 
at 
Berg 
with 
a 
smile.

"As 
you 
see," 
he 
said.

"Indeed? 
Yes, 
yes!" 
said 
Boris, 
with 
a 
smile. 
"And 
we 
too 
have
had 
a

the

And 
the 
two 
friends 
told 
each 
other 
of 
their 
doings, 
the 
one 
of 
his
hussar 
revels 
and 
life 
in 
the 
fighting 
line, 
the 
other 
of 
the 
pleasures
and 
advantages 
of 
service 
under 
members 
of 
the 
Imperial 
family.

"Oh, 
you 
Guards!" 
said 
Rostov. 
"I 
say, 
send 
for 
some 
wine."

Boris 
made 
a 
grimace.

"If 
you 
really 
want 
it," 
said 
he.

He 
went 
to 
his 
bed, 
drew 
a 
purse 
from 
under 
the 
clean 
pillow, 
and 
sent
for 
wine.

"Yes, 
and 
I 
have 
some 
money 
and 
a 
letter 
to 
give 
you," 
he 
added.

Rostov 
took 
the 
letter 
and, 
throwing 
the 
money 
on 
the 
sofa, 
put 
both
arms 
on 
the 
table 
and 
began 
to 
read. 
After 
reading 
a 
few 
lines, 
he
glanced 
angrily 
at 
Berg, 
then, 
meeting 
his 
eyes, 
hid 
his 
face 
behind 
the
letter.

"Well, 
they've 
sent 
you 
a 
tidy 
sum," 
said 
Berg, 
eying 
the 
heavy
purse 
that 
sank 
into 
the 
sofa. 
"As 
for 
us, 
Count, 
we 
get 
along 
on 
our

I 
can 
tell 
you

Do

he
exclaimed, 
and 
immediately 
seizing 
him 
by 
the 
shoulder 
and 
looking
amiably 
into 
his 
face, 
evidently<p>
wishing 
to 
soften 
the 
rudeness 
of 
his
words, 
he 
added, 
"Don't

"Oh,

Berg,
getting 
up

speaking 
in

"Go

At<p>

he 
heard 
in

the

was, 
the 
long-drawn
shouts 
of 
thousands 
of 
voices. 
His 
horse<p>
and 
the 
horse 
of 
the 
hussar
near 
him 
pricked 
their 
ears 
at 
these 
shouts. 
Over 
there, 
where 
the
shouting 
came 
from, 
a 
fire 
flared 
up 
and 
went 
out 
again, 
then 
another,
and 
all 
along 
the 
French 
line 
on 
the 
hill 
fires 
flared 
up 
and 
the
shouting 
grew 
louder 
and 
louder. 
Rostov 
could 
hear 
the 
sound 
of 
French
words 
but 
could 
not 
distinguish 
them. 
The 
din 
of 
many 
voices 
was 
too
great; 
all 
he 
could 
hear 
was: 
"ahahah!" 
and 
"rrrr!"

"What's 
that? 
What 
do 
you 
make 
of 
it?" 
said 
Rostov 
to 
the 
hussar
beside 
him. 
"That 
must 
be 
the 
enemy's 
camp!"

The 
hussar 
did 
not 
reply.

"Why, 
don't 
you 
hear 
it?" 
Rostov 
asked 
again, 
after 
waiting 
for 
a
reply.

"Who 
can 
tell, 
your 
honor?" 
replied 
the 
hussar 
reluctantly.

"From 
the 
direction, 
it 
must 
be 
the 
enemy," 
repeated 
Rostov.

"It 
may 
be 
he 
or 
it 
may 
be 
nothing," 
muttered 
the 
hussar. 
"It's
dark... 
Steady!" 
he 
cried 
to 
his 
fidgeting 
horse.

Rostov's 
horse 
was 
also 
getting 
restive: 
it 
pawed 
the 
frozen 
ground,
pricking 
its 
ears 
at 
the 
noise 
and 
looking 
at 
the 
lights. 
The 
shouting
grew 
still 
louder 
and 
merged 
into 
a 
general 
roar 
that 
only 
an 
army
of 
several 
thousand 
men 
could 
produce. 
The 
lights 
spread 
farther 
and
farther, 
probably 
along 
the 
line 
of 
the 
French 
camp. 
Rostov 
no 
longer
wanted 
to 
sleep. 
The 
gay 
triumphant 
shouting 
of 
the 
enemy 
army 
had 
a
stimulating 
effect 
on 
him. 
"Vive 
l'Empereur! 
l'Empereur!" 
he 
now
heard 
distinctly.

"They 
can't 
be 
far 
off, 
probably 
just 
beyond 
the 
stream," 
he 
said
to 
the 
hussar 
beside 
him.

The 
hussar 
only 
sighed 
without 
replying 
and 
coughed 
angrily. 
The 
sound
of 
horse's 
hoofs 
approaching 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
line 
of 
hussars 
was
heard, 
and 
out 
of 
the 
foggy 
darkness 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
sergeant 
of 
hussars
suddenly 
appeared, 
looming 
huge 
as 
an 
elephant.

"Your 
honor, 
the 
generals!" 
said 
the 
sergeant, 
riding 
up 
to 
Rostov.

Rostov, 
still 
looking 
round 
toward 
the 
fires 
and 
the 
shouts, 
rode 
with
the 
sergeant 
to 
meet 
some

were

longer
hearing 
the 
terrible 
sounds 
of 
the 
crowd, 
Rostopchin 
grew 
physically
calm 
and, 
as 
always 
happens, 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
became 
physically 
tranquil
his 
mind 
devised 
reasons 
why 
he 
should 
be 
mentally 
tranquil 
too. 
The
thought 
which 
tranquillized 
Rostopchin 
was 
not 
a 
new 
one. 
Since 
the
world 
began 
and 
men 
have 
killed 
one 
another 
no 
one 
has 
ever 
committed
such 
a 
crime 
against 
his 
<a href="/cZl/cw2Ptam8tUD0iPTJ.html">fellow</a> 
man 
without 
comforting 
himself 
with
this 
same 
idea. 
This 
idea 
is 
le 
bien 
public, 
the 
hypothetical 
welfare 
of
other 
people.

To 
a 
man 
not 
swayed 
by 
passion 
that 
welfare 
is 
never 
certain, 
but 
he
who 
commits 
such 
a 
crime 
always 
knows 
just 
where 
that 
welfare 
lies. 
And
Rostopchin 
now 
knew 
it.

Not 
only 
did 
his 
reason 
not 
reproach 
him 
for 
what 
he 
had 
done, 
but
he 
even 
found 
cause 
for 
self-satisfaction 
in 
having 
so 
successfully
contrived 
to 
avail 
himself 
of 
a 
convenient 
opportunity 
to 
punish 
a
criminal 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
pacify 
the 
mob.

"Vereshchagin 
was<p>
tried 
and 
condemned<p>
to 
death," 
thought 
Rostopchin
(though 
the 
Senate 
had 
only 
condemned 
Vereshchagin 
to 
hard 
labor), 
"he
was 
a

sad.

The 
peasants-even

have

said 
the 
soldier 
behind 
the 
cart,
addressing 
Pierre 
with 
a 
sad 
smile. 
"No

made 
nowadays....
They 
want

a

They

In 
spite 
of 
the 
obscurity 
of 
the 
soldier's 
words 
Pierre 
understood 
what
he 
wanted 
to 
say 
and 
nodded 
approval.

The 
road 
was 
clear 
again; 
Pierre 
descended

drove

He

Among 
the 
opinions 
and 
voices 
in 
this 
immense, 
restless, 
brilliant,
and 
proud 
sphere, 
Prince 
Andrew 
noticed 
the 
following 
sharply 
defined
subdivisions 
of 
tendencies 
and 
parties:

The 
first 
party 
consisted 
of 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents-military 
theorists
who 
believed 
in 
a 
science 
of 
war 
with 
immutable 
laws-laws 
of 
oblique
movements, 
outflankings, 
and 
so 
forth. 
Pfuel 
and 
his 
adherents 
demanded
a 
retirement 
into 
the 
depths 
of 
the 
country 
in 
accordance 
with 
precise
laws 
defined 
by 
a 
pseudo-theory 
of 
war, 
and 
they 
saw 
only 
barbarism,
ignorance, 
or 
evil 
intention 
in 
every 
deviation 
from 
that 
theory. 
To
this 
party 
belonged 
the 
foreign 
nobles, 
Wolzogen, 
Wintzingerode, 
and
others, 
chiefly 
Germans.

The 
second 
party 
was 
directly 
opposed 
to 
the 
first; 
one 
extreme, 
as
always 
happens, 
was 
met 
by 
representatives 
of 
the 
other. 
The 
members 
of
this 
party<p>
were 
those 
who 
had 
demanded 
an 
advance 
from 
Vilna 
into 
Poland
and 
freedom 
from 
all 
prearranged 
plans. 
Besides 
being 
advocates 
of 
bold
action,

he 
remarked.

An 
elderly 
sergeant<p>
who 
had 
approached 
the 
officer 
while 
he 
was 
giving
these 
explanations 
had 
waited 
in 
silence 
for 
him 
to 
finish 
speaking, 
but
at 
this 
point, 
evidently 
not 
liking 
the 
officer's 
remark, 
interrupted
him.

"Gabions 
must 
be 
sent 
for," 
said 
he 
sternly.

The 
officer 
appeared 
abashed, 
as 
though 
he 
understood 
that 
one 
might
think 
of 
how 
many 
men 
would 
be

"Well,

the 
officer 
replied 
hurriedly.

"And 
you, 
are 
you 
one 
of 
the 
doctors?"

"No, 
I've 
come

my

answered 
Pierre, 
and 
he 
went 
down 
the 
hill
again, 
passing 
the 
militiamen.

"Oh, 
those 
damned 
fellows!" 
muttered 
the 
officer 
who 
followed 
him,
holding 
his 
nose 
as 
he 
ran 
past 
the 
men 
at 
work.

"There 
they 
are... 
bringing 
her, 
coming... 
There 
they 
are... 
They'll 
be
here 
in 
a 
minute..." 
voices 
were 
suddenly 
heard 
saying; 
and 
officers,
soldiers, 
and 
militiamen 
began 
running 
forward 
along 
the 
road.

A 
church 
procession 
was 
coming 
up 
the 
hill 
from 
Borodino. 
First 
along
the 
dusty 
road 
came 
the 
infantry 
in 
ranks, 
bareheaded 
and 
with 
arms
reversed. 
From<p>
behind 
them 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
church<p>
singing.

Soldiers 
and 
militiamen 
ran 
bareheaded 
past 
Pierre 
toward 
the
procession.

"They 
are 
bringing 
her, 
our 
Protectress!... 
The 
Iberian 
Mother 
of 
God!"
someone 
cried.

"The 
Smolensk 
Mother 
of 
God," 
another 
corrected 
him.

The 
militiamen, 
both 
those 
who 
had 
been 
in 
the 
village 
and 
those 
who 
had
been 
at 
work 
on 
the 
battery, 
threw 
down 
their 
spades 
and 
ran 
to 
meet 
the
church 
procession. 
Following 
the 
battalion 
that 
marched 
along 
the 
dusty
road 
came 
priests 
in 
their 
vestments-one 
little 
old 
man 
in 
a 
hood 
with
attendants 
and 
singers. 
Behind 
them 
soldiers 
and 
officers 
bore 
a 
large,
dark-faced 
icon 
with 
an 
embossed 
metal 
cover. 
This 
was 
the 
icon 
that 
had
been 
brought 
from 
Smolensk 
and 
had 
since 
accompanied 
the 
army. 
Behind,
before, 
and 
on 
both 
sides, 
crowds 
of 
militiamen 
with 
bared 
heads 
walked,
ran, 
and 
bowed 
to 
the 
ground.

At 
the 
summit 
of 
the 
hill 
they 
stopped 
with 
the 
icon; 
the 
men 
who 
had
been 
holding 
it 
up 
by 
the 
linen 
bands 
attached 
to 
it 
were 
relieved 
by
others, 
the 
chanters 
relit 
their 
censers, 
and 
service 
began. 
The 
hot
rays 
of 
the 
sun 
beat 
down 
vertically 
and 
a 
fresh 
soft 
wind 
played 
with
the 
hair 
of 
the 
bared 
heads 
and 
with 
the 
ribbons 
decorating 
the 
icon.
The 
singing 
did 
not 
sound 
loud 
under 
the 
open 
sky. 
An 
immense 
crowd
of 
bareheaded 
officers, 
soldiers, 
and 
militiamen 
surrounded 
the 
icon.
Behind 
the 
priest 
and 
a 
chanter 
stood 
the 
notabilities 
on 
a 
spot
reserved 
for 
them. 
A 
bald 
general 
with 
a 
St. 
George's 
Cross 
on 
his 
neck
stood 
just 
behind 
the 
priest's 
back, 
and 
without 
crossing 
himself 
(he
was 
evidently 
a 
German) 
patiently 
awaited 
the 
end 
of 
the 
service, 
which
he 
considered 
it 
necessary 
to 
hear 
to 
the 
end, 
probably 
to 
arouse 
the
patriotism 
of 
the 
Russian 
people. 
Another 
general 
stood 
in 
a 
martial
pose, 
crossing 
himself 
by 
shaking 
his 
hand 
in 
front 
of 
his 
chest
while 
looking 
about 
him. 
Standing 
among 
the

tobacco 
smoke, 
they 
talked
of 
the 
war 
that 
had 
been 
announced 
in 
a 
manifesto, 
and 
about 
the
recruiting. 
None 
of 
them 
had 
yet 
seen 
the 
manifesto, 
but 
they 
all 
knew
it 
had 
appeared. 
The 
count 
sat 
on 
the 
sofa 
between 
two 
guests<p>
who 
were
smoking 
and 
talking. 
He 
neither 
smoked 
nor<p>
talked, 
but 
bending 
his 
head
first 
to 
one 
side 
and 
then 
to 
the 
other 
watched 
the 
smokers 
with 
evident
pleasure 
and 
listened 
to 
the 
conversation 
of 
his 
two 
neighbors, 
whom 
he
egged 
on 
against 
each 
other.

One 
of 
them 
was 
a 
sallow, 
clean-shaven 
civilian 
with 
a 
thin 
and 
wrinkled
face, 
already 
growing 
old, 
though 
he 
was 
dressed 
like 
a 
most 
fashionable
young 
man. 
He 
sat 
with 
his 
legs 
up 
on 
the 
sofa 
as 
if 
quite 
at 
home 
and,
having 
stuck 
an 
amber 
mouthpiece 
far 
into 
his 
mouth, 
was 
inhaling 
the
smoke 
spasmodically 
and 
screwing 
up 
his 
eyes. 
This 
was 
an 
old 
bachelor,
Shinshin, 
a 
cousin 
of 
the 
countess', 
a 
man 
with 
"a 
sharp 
tongue"
as 
they 
said 
in 
Moscow 
society.<p>
He 
seemed 
to 
be 
condescending 
to
his 
companion. 
The 
latter, 
a 
fresh, 
rosy 
officer 
of 
the 
Guards,
irreproachably 
washed, 
brushed, 
and 
buttoned, 
held 
his 
pipe 
in 
the
middle 
of 
his 
mouth 
and 
with 
red 
lips 
gently 
inhaled 
the 
smoke, 
letting
it 
escape 
from 
his 
handsome 
mouth 
in 
rings. 
This 
was 
Lieutenant 
Berg, 
an
officer 
in 
the 
Semenov 
regiment 
with 
whom 
Boris 
was 
to 
travel 
to 
join
the 
army, 
and 
about 
whom 
Natasha 
had 
teased 
her 
elder 
sister 
Vera,
speaking 
of 
Berg 
as 
her 
"intended." 
The 
count 
sat 
between 
them 
and
listened 
attentively. 
His 
favorite 
occupation 
when 
not 
playing 
boston, 
a
card

was 
very 
fond 
of, 
was

and 
was 
awakened 
soon 
after 
midnight 
by 
a 
courier
bringing 
him 
a 
letter 
from 
Kutuzov. 
This 
letter 
requested 
the 
count 
to
send 
police 
officers 
to 
guide 
the 
troops 
through 
the 
town, 
as 
the 
army
was 
retreating 
to 
the 
Ryazan 
road 
beyond 
Moscow. 
This 
was 
not 
news 
to
Rostopchin. 
He 
had 
known 
that 
Moscow 
would 
be 
abandoned 
not 
merely 
since
his 
interview 
the 
previous 
day 
with 
Kutuzov 
on 
the 
Poklonny 
Hill 
but
ever 
since 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino, 
for 
all 
the 
generals 
who 
came 
to
Moscow 
after 
that 
battle 
had 
said 
unanimously 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to
fight 
another 
battle, 
and 
since 
then 
the 
government 
property 
had 
been
removed 
every 
night, 
and 
half 
the 
inhabitants 
had 
left 
the 
city
with 
Rostopchin's 
own 
permission. 
Yet 
all 
the 
same 
this 
information
astonished 
and 
irritated 
the 
count, 
coming 
as 
it 
did 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a
simple 
note 
with 
an 
order 
from 
Kutuzov, 
and 
received 
at 
night, 
breaking
in 
on 
his 
beauty 
sleep.

When 
later 
on 
in 
his 
memoirs 
Count 
Rostopchin 
explained 
his 
actions 
at
this 
time, 
he 
repeatedly 
says 
that 
he 
was 
then 
actuated 
by 
two 
important
considerations: 
to 
maintain 
tranquillity 
in 
Moscow 
and 
expedite 
the
departure 
of 
the 
inhabitants. 
If 
one 
accepts 
this 
twofold 
aim<p>
all
Rostopchin's 
actions 
appear 
irreproachable. 
"Why 
were 
the 
holy 
relics,
the 
arms, 
ammunition, 
gunpowder, 
and 
stores 
of 
corn 
not 
removed? 
Why
were 
thousands 
of 
inhabitants 
deceived 
into 
believing 
that 
Moscow 
would
not 
be 
given 
up-and 
thereby 
ruined?" 
"To 
preserve 
the 
tranquillity
of 
the 
city," 
explains 
Count 
Rostopchin. 
"Why 
were 
bundles 
of 
useless
papers 
from 
the 
government 
offices, 
and 
Leppich's<p>
balloon 
and 
other
articles 
removed?" 
"To 
leave 
the 
town 
empty," 
explains 
Count 
Rostopchin.
One 
need 
only 
admit 
that 
public 
tranquillity 
is<p>
in 
danger 
and 
any 
action
finds 
a 
justification.

All 
the 
horrors 
of 
the 
reign 
of 
terror 
were 
based 
only 
on 
solicitude 
for
public 
tranquillity.

On 
what, 
then, 
was 
Count 
Rostopchin's 
fear 
for 
the 
tranquillity 
of
Moscow 
based 
in 
1812? 
What 
reason 
was 
there 
for 
assuming 
any 
probability
of 
an 
uprising 
in<p>
the 
city? 
The 
inhabitants 
were 
leaving 
it 
and 
the
retreating 
troops 
were 
filling 
it. 
Why 
should 
that 
cause 
the 
masses 
to
riot?

Neither 
in 
Moscow 
nor 
anywhere 
in 
Russia 
did 
anything 
resembling 
an
insurrection 
ever 
occur 
when 
the 
enemy 
entered 
a 
town. 
More 
than
ten 
thousand 
people 
were 
still 
in 
Moscow 
on 
the 
first 
and 
second 
of
September, 
and 
except 
for 
a 
mob 
in 
the 
governor's 
courtyard, 
assembled
there 
at 
his 
bidding, 
nothing 
happened. 
It 
is 
obvious 
that 
there 
would
have 
been 
even 
less 
reason 
to 
expect 
a 
disturbance 
among 
the 
people
if 
after 
the 
battle 
of 
Borodino, 
when 
the 
surrender 
of 
Moscow 
became
certain 
or 
at 
least 
probable, 
Rostopchin 
instead 
of 
exciting 
the 
people
by 
distributing 
arms 
and 
broadsheets 
had 
taken 
steps 
to 
remove 
all
the 
holy 
relics, 
the 
gunpowder, 
munitions, 
and 
money, 
and 
had 
told 
the
population 
plainly 
that 
the 
town 
would 
be 
abandoned.

Rostopchin, 
though 
he 
had 
patriotic 
sentiments, 
was 
a 
sanguine 
and
impulsive 
man 
who 
had 
always 
moved 
in<p>
the 
highest 
administrative 
circles
and 
had 
no 
understanding 
at 
all 
of 
the 
people 
he 
supposed 
himself 
to
be 
guiding. 
Ever 
since 
the 
enemy's 
entry 
into 
Smolensk 
he 
had 
in
imagination 
been 
playing 
the 
role 
of 
director 
of 
the 
popular 
feeling
of 
"the 
heart 
of 
Russia." 
Not 
only 
did 
it 
seem 
to 
him 
(as 
to 
all
administrators) 
that 
he 
controlled 
the 
external 
actions 
of 
Moscow's
inhabitants, 
but 
he 
also 
thought 
he 
controlled 
their 
mental 
attitude 
by
means 
of 
his 
broadsheets 
and 
posters, 
written 
in 
a 
coarse 
tone 
which 
the
people 
despise 
in 
their 
own 
class 
and 
do 
not 
understand 
from 
those 
in
authority. 
Rostopchin 
was 
so 
pleased 
with 
the 
fine 
role 
of 
leader 
of
popular 
feeling, 
and 
had 
grown 
so 
used 
to 
it, 
that 
the 
necessity 
of
relinquishing 
that 
role 
and 
abandoning 
Moscow 
without 
any 
heroic 
display
took 
him 
unawares 
and 
he 
suddenly 
felt

CHAPTER 
IV

The 
flood 
of 
nations 
begins 
to 
subside 
into 
its 
normal 
channels. 
The
waves 
of 
the 
great 
movement 
abate, 
and 
on 
the 
calm 
surface 
eddies 
are
formed 
in

A 
minute 
later 
the 
old 
man's 
large 
stout 
figure 
in 
full-dress 
uniform,
his 
chest 
covered 
with 
orders 
and 
a 
scarf 
drawn 
round 
his 
stomach,
waddled 
out 
into 
the 
porch. 
He 
put 
on 
his 
hat 
with 
its 
peaks 
to 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/dc12G3.html">the
sides</a> 
and, 
holding 
his 
gloves 
in 
his 
hand 
and 
walking 
with 
an 
effort
sideways 
down 
the 
steps 
to 
the 
level 
of 
the 
street, 
took 
in 
his 
hand 
the
report 
he 
had 
prepared 
for 
the 
Emperor.

There 
was 
running 
to 
and 
fro 
and 
whispering; 
another 
troyka 
flew
furiously 
up, 
and 
then 
all 
eyes 
were 
turned 
on 
an 
approaching 
sleigh
in 
which 
the 
figures 
of 
the 
Emperor 
and 
Volkonski 
could 
already 
be
descried.

From 
the 
habit 
of 
fifty 
years 
all 
this 
had 
a 
physically 
agitating 
effect
on 
the 
old 
general. 
He 
carefully 
and 
hastily 
felt 
himself 
all 
over,
readjusted 
his 
hat, 
and 
pulling 
himself 
together 
drew 
himself 
up 
and,
at 
the 
very 
moment 
when 
the 
Emperor, 
having 
alighted 
from 
the 
sleigh,
lifted 
his 
eyes 
to 
him, 
handed 
him 
the 
report 
and 
began 
speaking 
in 
his
smooth, 
ingratiating 
voice.

The 
Emperor 
with 
a 
rapid 
glance 
scanned 
Kutuzov 
from 
head 
to 
foot,
frowned 
for 
an 
instant, 
but 
immediately 
mastering 
himself 
went 
up 
to 
the
old 
man, 
extended 
his 
arms 
and 
embraced 
him. 
And 
this 
embrace 
too, 
owing
to 
a 
long-standing 
impression 
related 
to 
his 
innermost 
feelings, 
had 
its
usual 
effect 
on 
Kutuzov 
and 
he 
gave 
a 
sob.

The 
Emperor 
greeted 
the 
officers<p>
and 
the 
Semenov 
guard, 
and 
again
pressing 
the 
old 
man's 
hand 
went 
with 
him 
into 
the 
castle.

When 
alone 
with 
the 
field 
marshal 
the 
Emperor 
expressed 
his
dissatisfaction 
at 
the 
slowness 
of 
the 
pursuit 
and 
at 
the 
mistakes 
made
at 
Krasnoe 
and 
the 
Berezina, 
and 
informed 
him 
of 
his 
intentions 
for 
a
future 
campaign 
abroad. 
Kutuzov 
made 
no 
rejoinder 
or 
remark. 
The 
same
submissive, 
expressionless 
look 
with 
which 
he 
had 
listened 
to 
the
Emperor's 
commands 
on 
the 
field 
of 
Austerlitz 
seven 
years 
before 
settled
on 
his 
face 
now.

When 
Kutuzov 
came 
out 
of 
the 
study 
and 
with 
lowered 
head 
was 
crossing
the 
ballroom 
with 
his 
heavy 
waddling 
gait, 
he 
was 
arrested 
by 
someone's
voice 
saying:

"Your 
Serene<p>
Highness!"

Kutuzov 
raised 
his 
head 
and 
looked 
for 
a 
long 
while 
into 
the 
eyes 
of
Count 
Tolstoy, 
who 
stood 
before 
him 
holding 
a 
silver 
salver 
on 
which 
lay
a 
small 
object. 
Kutuzov 
seemed 
not 
to 
understand 
what 
was 
expected 
of
him.

Suddenly 
he 
seemed 
to 
remember; 
a 
scarcely 
perceptible 
smile 
flashed
across 
his 
puffy 
face, 
and 
bowing 
low 
and 
respectfully 
he 
took 
the
object 
that 
lay 
on 
the 
salver. 
It 
was 
the 
Order 
of 
St. 
George 
of 
the
First 
Class.





CHAPTER 
XI

Next 
day 
the 
field 
marshal 
gave 
a 
dinner 
and 
ball 
which 
the 
Emperor
honored 
by<p>
his 
presence. 
Kutuzov 
had 
received 
the 
Order 
of 
St. 
George
of 
the 
First 
Class 
and 
the 
Emperor 
showed 
him 
the 
highest 
honors, 
but
everyone 
knew 
of 
the 
imperial 
dissatisfaction 
with 
him. 
The 
proprieties
were 
observed 
and 
the 
Emperor 
was 
the 
first 
to 
set 
that 
example,
but 
everybody 
understood 
that 
the 
old 
man 
was 
blameworthy 
and
good-for-nothing. 
When 
Kutuzov, 
conforming 
to 
a 
custom 
of 
Catherine's
day, 
ordered 
the 
standards<p>
that 
had 
been 
captured 
to 
be 
lowered 
at 
the
Emperor's 
feet 
on 
his 
entering 
the 
ballroom, 
the 
Emperor 
made 
a 
wry 
face
and 
muttered 
something 
in 
which 
some 
people 
caught 
the<p>
words, 
"the 
old
comedian."

The 
Emperor's 
displeasure 
with 
Kutuzov 
was 
specially 
increased 
at 
Vilna
by 
the 
fact 
that 
Kutuzov 
evidently 
could 
not 
or 
would 
not 
understand 
the
importance 
of 
the 
coming 
campaign.

When 
on 
the 
following 
morning 
the 
Emperor 
said 
to 
the 
officers 
assembled
about 
him: 
"You 
have 
not 
only 
saved 
Russia, 
you 
have 
saved 
Europe!" 
they
all 
understood 
that 
the 
war 
was 
not 
ended.

Kutuzov 
alone 
would 
not 
see 
this 
and 
openly 
expressed 
his 
opinion 
that
no 
fresh

an

"Colonel," 
interrupted 
the<p>
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
"You 
must 
be
quick 
or 
the 
enemy 
will 
bring 
up 
his 
guns 
to 
use 
grapeshot."

The 
colonel 
looked 
silently 
at 
the 
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
at 
the 
stout
staff 
officer, 
and 
at 
Zherkov, 
and 
he 
frowned.

"I 
will 
the 
bridge 
fire," 
he 
said 
in 
a 
solemn 
tone 
as 
if 
to 
announce
that 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
unpleasantness 
he 
had 
to 
endure 
he 
would 
still
do 
the 
right 
thing.

Striking 
his 
horse 
with 
his 
long 
muscular 
legs 
as 
if 
it 
were 
to 
blame
for 
everything, 
the 
colonel 
moved 
forward 
and 
ordered 
the 
second
squadron, 
that 
in 
which 
Rostov 
was 
serving 
under 
Denisov, 
to 
return 
to
the 
bridge.

"There, 
it's 
just 
as 
I 
thought," 
said 
Rostov 
to 
himself. 
"He
wishes 
to 
test 
me!" 
His 
heart 
contracted 
and 
the 
blood 
rushed 
to 
his
face. 
"Let 
him 
see 
whether 
I 
am 
a 
coward!" 
he 
thought.

Again 
on 
all 
the 
bright 
faces 
of 
the 
squadron 
the 
serious 
expression
appeared 
that 
they 
had 
worn 
when 
under 
fire. 
Rostov 
watched 
his 
enemy,
the 
colonel, 
closely-to 
find 
in 
his 
face 
confirmation 
of 
his 
own
conjecture, 
but 
the 
colonel 
did 
not 
once 
glance 
at 
Rostov, 
and 
looked
as 
he 
always 
did 
when 
at 
the 
front, 
solemn 
and 
stern. 
Then 
came 
the 
word
of 
command.

"Look 
sharp! 
Look 
sharp!" 
several 
voices 
repeated 
around 
him.

Their 
sabers 
catching 
in 
the 
bridles 
and 
their 
spurs 
jingling, 
the
hussars 
hastily 
dismounted, 
not 
knowing 
what 
they 
were 
to 
do. 
The 
men
were 
crossing 
themselves. 
Rostov 
no 
longer 
looked 
at 
the 
colonel, 
he
had 
no 
time. 
He 
was 
afraid 
of 
falling 
behind 
the 
hussars, 
so 
much 
afraid
that 
his 
heart 
stood 
still. 
His 
hand 
trembled 
as 
he 
gave 
his 
horse 
into
an 
orderly's 
charge, 
and 
he 
felt 
the 
blood 
rush 
to 
his 
heart 
with
a 
thud. 
Denisov 
rode 
past 
him, 
leaning 
back 
and 
shouting 
something.
Rostov 
saw 
nothing 
but 
the 
hussars 
running 
all 
around 
him, 
their 
spurs
catching 
and 
their 
sabers 
clattering.

"Stretchers!" 
shouted 
someone 
behind 
him.

Rostov 
did 
not 
think 
what 
this 
call 
for 
stretchers 
meant; 
he 
ran 
on,
trying 
only 
to 
be 
ahead 
of 
the 
others; 
but 
just 
at 
the 
bridge, 
not
looking 
at 
the 
ground, 
he 
came 
on 
some 
sticky, 
trodden 
mud, 
stumbled,
and 
fell 
on 
his 
hands. 
The 
others 
outstripped 
him.

"At 
boss 
zides, 
Captain," 
he 
heard 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
colonel,<p>
who,
having 
ridden 
ahead, 
had 
pulled 
up 
his 
horse 
near 
the 
bridge, 
with 
a
triumphant, 
cheerful 
face.

Rostov 
wiping 
his 
muddy 
hands 
on 
his 
breeches 
looked 
at 
his 
enemy 
and
was 
about 
to 
run 
on, 
thinking 
that 
the 
farther 
he 
went 
to 
the 
front
the 
better. 
But 
Bogdanich, 
<a href="/cZl/vf3gJL1H5UTE.html">without</a> 
looking 
at 
or 
recognizing 
Rostov,
shouted 
to 
him:

"Who's 
that 
running 
on<p>
the 
middle 
of 
the 
bridge? 
To 
the 
right! 
Come
back, 
Cadet!" 
he 
cried 
angrily; 
and 
turning 
to 
<a href="/cZl/qZ41SUlC6ZNkA.html">Denisov,</a> 
who, 
showing
off 
his 
courage, 
had 
ridden 
on 
to 
the 
planks 
of 
the 
bridge:

"Why 
run 
risks, 
Captain? 
You 
should 
dismount," 
he 
said.

"Oh, 
every 
bullet 
has 
its 
<a href="/cZl/QJ8oqw2H6T.html">billet,"</a> 
answered<p>
Vaska 
Denisov, 
turning
in 
his

Zherkov, 
and 
the

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kU2vxtj0vGX5ny.html">of</a>

"To

the 
tortured 
Frenchman 
and 
the 
crowd 
<a href="/cZl/jl6NPl04.html">surrounding</a> 
the
Lobnoe

Pierre 
had 
so 
definitely 
made 
up 
his 
mind 
that 
he 
could 
no

remain 
in 
Moscow 
and 
would 
leave

him 
that 
either 
he 
had 
told 
the 
coachman 
this 
or 
that 
the
man 
ought 
to 
have 
known 
it 
for 
himself.

On 
reaching 
home 
Pierre 
gave 
orders 
to 
Evstafey-his 
head 
coachman 
who
knew 
everything, 
could 
do 
anything, 
and 
was 
known 
to 
all 
Moscow-that
he 
would 
leave 
that 
night 
for 
the 
army 
at 
Mozhaysk, 
and 
that 
his 
saddle
horses 
should 
be 
sent 
there. 
This 
could 
not 
all 
be 
arranged 
that 
day,
so 
on 
Evstafey's 
representation 
Pierre 
had 
to 
put 
off

CHAPTER 
VII

Two 
months 
had 
elapsed 
since 
the 
news 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Austerlitz 
and
the 
loss 
of 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
reached 
Bald 
Hills, 
and 
in 
spite 
of 
the
letters 
sent 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/nB9UJpiB5Wtf8tc.html">through</a> 
the 
embassy 
and 
all 
the 
searches 
made, 
his 
body 
had
not 
<a href="/cZl/jf4H02Npkec.html">been</a> 
found 
nor 
was 
he 
on 
the 
list 
of 
prisoners. 
What 
was 
worst 
of
all 
for 
his 
relations 
was 
the 
fact 
that 
there 
was 
still 
a 
possibility 
of
his 
having 
been 
picked 
up 
on 
the 
battlefield 
by 
the 
people 
of 
the
place 
and 
that 
he 
might 
now 
be 
lying, 
recovering 
or 
dying, 
alone 
among
strangers 
and 
unable 
to 
send 
news 
of 
himself. 
The 
gazettes 
from 
which
the 
old 
prince<p>
first 
heard 
of 
the 
defeat 
at 
Austerlitz 
stated, 
as 
usual
very 
briefly 
and 
vaguely, 
that 
after 
brilliant 
engagements 
the 
Russians
had 
had 
to 
retreat 
and 
had 
made 
their 
withdrawal 
in 
perfect 
order. 
The
old 
prince 
understood 
from 
this 
official 
report 
that 
our 
army 
had 
been
defeated. 
A 
week 
after 
the 
gazette 
report 
of 
the 
battle 
of 
Austerlitz
came 
a 
letter 
from 
Kutuzov 
informing 
the 
prince 
of 
the 
fate 
that 
had
befallen 
his 
son.

"Your 
son,"<p>
wrote 
Kutuzov, 
"fell 
before 
my 
eyes, 
a 
standard 
in
his 
hand 
and 
at 
the 
head 
of 
a 
regiment-he 
fell 
as 
a 
hero, 
worthy 
of
his 
father 
and 
his 
fatherland. 
To 
the 
great 
regret 
of 
myself 
and 
of 
the
whole 
army 
it 
is 
<a href="/aVzUge/WU9KXJ0ACoNJ.html">still</a> 
uncertain 
whether 
he 
is 
alive 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ct7o64GFXfk.html">or</a> 
not. 
I 
comfort
myself 
and 
you 
with 
the 
hope 
that 
your 
son 
is 
alive, 
for 
otherwise
he 
would 
have 
been 
mentioned 
among 
the 
officers 
found 
on 
the 
field 
of
battle, 
a 
list 
of 
whom 
has 
been 
sent 
me 
under 
flag 
of 
truce."

After 
receiving 
this 
news 
late 
in 
the 
evening, 
when 
he 
was 
alone 
in 
his
study,

of 
the</h1>forest 
into 
the
bright 
firelight 
stepped 
two 
strangely 
clad<p>
human 
figures 
clinging 
to
one 
another.

These 
were 
two 
Frenchmen 
who 
had 
been 
hiding 
in 
the 
forest. 
They 
came 
up
to 
the 
fire, 
hoarsely 
uttering 
something 
in 
a 
language 
our 
soldiers 
did
not 
understand. 
One 
was 
taller 
than 
the 
other; 
he 
wore 
an 
officer's 
hat
and 
seemed 
quite 
exhausted. 
On 
approaching 
the 
fire 
he 
had 
been 
going 
to
sit 
down, 
but 
fell. 
The 
other, 
a 
short 
sturdy 
soldier 
with 
a 
shawl
tied 
round 
his 
head, 
was 
stronger. 
He 
raised 
his<p>
companion<p>
and 
said
something, 
pointing 
to 
his 
mouth. 
The 
soldiers 
surrounded 
the 
Frenchmen,
spread 
a 
greatcoat 
on 
the 
ground 
for 
the 
sick 
man, 
and 
brought 
some
buckwheat 
porridge 
and 
vodka 
for 
both 
of 
them.

The 
exhausted 
French 
officer 
was 
Ramballe 
and 
the 
man 
with 
his 
head
wrapped 
in 
the 
shawl 
was 
Morel, 
his 
orderly.

When 
Morel 
had 
drunk 
some 
vodka 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/gJL2AgW2UGRY0uIRD.html">finished</a> 
his 
bowl 
of 
porridge 
he
suddenly 
became 
unnaturally 
merry 
and 
chattered 
incessantly 
to 
the
soldiers, 
who 
could 
not 
understand 
him. 
Ramballe 
refused 
food 
<a href="/cZl/PK8tHLaX8sfA3mTUVM.html">and
resting</a> 
his 
head 
on 
his 
elbow 
lay 
silent 
beside 
the 
campfire, 
looking<p>
at
the 
Russian 
soldiers 
with 
red 
and 
vacant 
eyes. 
Occasionally 
he 
emitted
a 
long-drawn 
groan 
and 
then 
again 
became 
silent. 
Morel, 
pointing 
to 
his
shoulders, 
tried 
to 
impress 
on 
the 
soldiers 
the 
fact 
that 
Ramballe 
was
an 
officer 
and 
ought 
to 
be 
warmed. 
A 
Russian 
officer 
who 
had 
come 
up
to 
the 
fire 
sent 
to 
ask 
his 
colonel 
whether 
he 
would 
not 
take 
a 
French
officer 
into 
his 
hut 
to 
warm 
him, 
and 
when 
the 
messenger 
returned 
and
said 
that 
the 
colonel 
wished 
the 
officer 
to 
be 
brought 
to 
him, 
Ramballe
was 
told 
to 
go. 
He 
rose 
and 
tried 
to 
walk, 
but 
staggered 
and 
would 
have
fallen 
had 
not 
a 
soldier 
standing 
by 
held 
him 
up.

"You 
won't 
do 
it 
again, 
eh?" 
said 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers, 
winking 
and
turning 
mockingly 
to 
Ramballe.

"Oh, 
you 
fool! 
Why 
talk 
rubbish, 
lout 
that 
you 
are-a 
real 
peasant!" 
came
rebukes 
from 
all 
sides 
addressed 
to 
the 
jesting 
soldier.

They 
surrounded 
Ramballe, 
lifted 
him 
on 
the 
crossed 
arms 
of 
two
soldiers, 
and 
carried 
him 
to 
the 
hut. 
Ramballe 
put 
his 
arms 
around 
their
necks 
while 
they 
carried 
him 
and 
began 
wailing 
plaintively:

"Oh, 
you<p>
fine 
fellows, 
my 
kind, 
kind 
friends! 
These 
are 
men! 
Oh, 
my
brave, 
kind 
friends," 
and 
he 
leaned 
his 
head 
against 
the 
shoulder 
of 
one
of 
the 
men 
like 
a 
child.

Meanwhile 
Morel 
was 
sitting 
in 
the 
best 
place 
by 
the 
fire, 
surrounded 
by
the 
soldiers.

Morel, 
a 
short 
sturdy 
Frenchman 
with 
inflamed 
and 
streaming 
eyes, 
was
wearing 
a 
woman's 
cloak 
and 
had 
a 
shawl 
tied 
woman<p>
fashion 
round 
his
head 
over 
his 
cap. 
He 
was 
evidently 
tipsy, 
and 
was 
singing 
a 
French 
song
in 
a 
hoarse 
broken 
voice, 
with 
an 
arm 
thrown 
round 
the 
nearest 
soldier.
The 
soldiers 
simply 
held 
their 
sides 
as 
they 
watched 
him.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then, 
teach 
us 
how 
it 
goes! 
I'll 
soon 
pick 
it 
up. 
How 
is
it?" 
said 
the 
man-a 
singer 
and 
a 
wag-whom 
Morel 
was 
embracing.

"Vive 
Henri 
Quatre! 
Vive 
ce 
roi 
valiant!" 
sang 
Morel, 
winking. 
"Ce
diable 
a

come
back 
to 
him 
in 
his 
designation 
as 
"the 
man 
who 
does 
not 
give 
his 
name,"
and 
under 
that 
appellation, 
which 
to 
Pierre 
seemed 
terrible, 
they 
were
now 
leading 
him 
somewhere 
with 
unhesitating 
assurance 
on 
their 
faces
that 
he 
and 
all 
the 
other 
prisoners 
were 
exactly 
the 
ones 
they 
wanted
and 
that 
they 
were 
being 
taken 
to 
the 
proper<p>
place. 
Pierre 
felt 
himself
to 
be 
an 
insignificant 
chip 
fallen 
among 
the 
wheels 
of 
a 
machine<p>
whose
action 
he 
did 
not 
<a href="/cZl/AR8XHd0BF6AJH.html">understand</a> 
but 
which 
was 
working 
well.

He 
and 
the 
other 
prisoners 
were<p>
taken 
to 
the 
right 
side 
of 
the 
Virgin's
Field, 
to 
a 
large 
white 
house 
with 
an 
immense 
garden 
not 
far 
from 
the
convent. 
This 
was 
Prince 
Shcherbatov's 
house, 
where 
Pierre 
had 
often
been 
in 
other 
days, 
and 
which, 
as 
he 
learned 
from 
the 
talk 
of 
the
soldiers, 
was 
now 
occupied 
by 
the 
marshal, 
the 
Duke 
of 
Eckmuehl 
(Davout).

They 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
entrance 
and 
led 
into 
the 
house 
one 
by 
one.
Pierre 
was 
the 
sixth 
to 
enter. 
He 
was 
conducted 
through 
a 
glass 
gallery,
an 
anteroom, 
and 
a 
hall, 
which 
were 
familiar 
to 
him, 
into 
a 
long 
low
study 
at 
the 
door 
of 
which 
stood 
an 
adjutant.

Davout, 
spectacles 
on 
nose, 
sat 
bent 
over 
a 
table 
at 
the 
further 
end 
of
the 
room. 
Pierre 
went 
close 
up 
to 
him, 
but 
Davout, 
evidently 
consulting
a 
paper 
that 
lay 
before 
him, 
did 
not 
look 
up. 
Without 
raising 
his 
eyes,
he 
said 
in 
a<p>
low 
voice:

"Who 
are 
you?"

Pierre 
was 
silent 
because 
he 
was 
incapable 
of 
uttering 
a 
word. 
To 
him
Davout 
was 
not 
merely<p>
a 
French 
general, 
but 
a 
man 
notorious 
for 
his
cruelty. 
Looking 
at 
his 
cold 
face, 
as 
he 
sat 
like 
a 
stern 
schoolmaster
who 
was 
prepared 
to 
wait 
awhile 
for 
an 
answer, 
Pierre 
felt 
that 
every
instant 
of 
delay 
might 
cost 
him 
his 
life; 
but 
he 
did 
not 
know 
what
to 
say. 
He 
did 
not 
venture 
to 
repeat 
what 
<a href="/aVzUge/CB4W7ZhuM9hpNsY.html">he</a> 
had<p>
said 
at 
his 
first
examination, 
yet 
to 
disclose 
his 
rank 
and 
position 
was 
dangerous 
and
embarrassing. 
So 
he 
was 
silent. 
But 
before 
he 
had 
decided 
what 
to 
do,
Davout 
raised 
his 
head, 
pushed 
his 
spectacles 
back 
on 
his 
forehead,
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes, 
and 
looked 
intently 
at 
<a href="/aVzUge/bv7AHAK9LoN2ikR.html">him.

"I</a>

he

The

reason 
Princess 
Mary 
did 
not 
realize 
the 
full 
significance 
of
this 
war 
was 
that 
the 
old 
prince 
never 
spoke 
of 
it, 
did 
not 
recognize
it, 
and 
laughed 
at 
Dessalles 
when 
he 
mentioned 
it 
at 
dinner.
The 
prince's 
tone 
was 
so 
calm 
and 
confident 
that 
Princess 
Mary
unhesitatingly 
believed 
him.

All 
that 
July 
the 
old 
prince 
was 
exceedingly 
active 
and 
even 
animated.
He 
planned 
another 
garden 
and 
began 
a 
new 
building 
for 
the 
domestic
serfs. 
The 
only 
thing 
that 
made 
Princess 
Mary 
anxious 
about 
him 
was 
that
he 
slept 
very 
little 
and, 
instead 
of 
sleeping 
in 
his 
study 
as 
usual,
changed 
his 
sleeping

day. 
One

The 
news 
of 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
death 
reached 
us 
before 
your 
letter
and 
my 
father 
was 
much 
affected 
by 
it. 
He 
says 
the 
count 
was 
the 
last
representative 
but 
one 
of 
the 
great 
century, 
and 
that 
it 
is 
his 
own
turn 
now, 
but 
that 
he 
will 
do 
all 
he 
can 
to 
let 
his 
turn 
come 
as 
late 
as
possible. 
God 
preserve 
us 
from 
that 
terrible 
misfortune!

I 
cannot 
agree 
with 
you 
about 
Pierre, 
whom 
I 
knew 
as 
a 
child. 
He 
always
seemed 
to 
me 
to 
have 
an 
excellent 
heart, 
and 
that 
is 
the 
quality 
I 
value
most<p>
in 
people. 
As 
to 
his 
inheritance 
and 
the 
part 
played 
by 
Prince
Vasili, 
it 
is 
very 
sad 
for 
both. 
Ah, 
my 
dear 
friend, 
our 
divine
Saviour's 
words, 
that 
it 
is 
easier 
for 
a 
camel 
to 
go 
through 
the
eye 
of 
a 
needle 
than 
for 
a 
rich 
man 
to 
enter 
the 
Kingdom 
of 
God, 
are
terribly 
true. 
I 
pity 
Prince 
Vasili 
but 
am 
still 
more 
sorry 
for 
Pierre.
So 
young, 
and 
burdened 
with 
such 
riches-to 
what 
temptations 
he 
will 
be
exposed! 
If 
I 
were 
asked 
what 
I 
desire 
most 
on 
earth, 
it 
would 
be 
to 
be
poorer 
than 
the 
poorest 
beggar. 
A 
thousand 
thanks, 
dear 
friend, 
for 
the
volume 
you 
have 
sent 
me 
and 
which 
has 
such 
success 
in 
Moscow. 
Yet 
since
you 
tell 
me 
that 
among 
some 
good 
things 
it 
contains 
others 
which 
our
weak 
human 
understanding 
cannot 
grasp, 
it 
seems 
to 
me 
rather 
useless 
to
spend 
time 
in 
reading 
what 
is 
unintelligible 
and 
can 
therefore 
bear
no 
fruit. 
I 
never 
could 
understand 
the 
fondness 
some 
people 
have 
for
confusing 
their 
minds 
by 
dwelling 
on 
mystical 
books 
that 
merely 
awaken
their 
doubts 
and 
excite 
their 
imagination, 
giving 
them 
a 
bent 
for
exaggeration 
quite<p>
contrary 
to 
Christian 
simplicity. 
Let 
us 
rather 
read
the 
Epistles 
and 
Gospels. 
Let 
us 
not 
seek 
to 
penetrate 
what 
mysteries
they 
contain;

how

went

In

stood 
carriages 
without 
horses 
and 
things 
were 
being 
packed
into

still
horrified 
by 
her 
spiritual 
baseness 
and 
trying 
to 
arrange 
her 
thoughts
before 
going 
to 
her

The 
doctor 
came 
downstairs 
and 
went 
out 
to
her.

"He 
is 
a 
little 
better 
today," 
said 
he. 
"I 
was 
looking 
for

One 
can

Princess 
Mary's

so 
violently 
at 
this 
news

she 
grew 
pale
and 
leaned 
against

keep 
from

a 
torment

"Come," 
said 
the 
doctor.

Princess 
Mary 
entered 
her 
father's 
room 
and 
went 
up 
to 
his 
bed. 
He 
was
lying 
on 
his 
back 
propped 
up 
high, 
and 
his 
small 
bony 
hands 
with
their 
knotted 
purple 
veins 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
quilt; 
his 
left 
eye 
gazed
straight 
before 
him, 
his 
right 
eye 
was 
awry, 
and 
his 
brows 
and 
lips
motionless. 
He 
seemed 
altogether 
so 
thin, 
small, 
and 
pathetic. 
His 
face
seemed 
to 
have 
shriveled 
or 
melted; 
his 
features 
had 
grown 
smaller.
Princess 
Mary 
went 
up 
and 
kissed 
his 
hand. 
His 
left 
hand 
pressed 
hers
so 
that 
she 
understood 
that 
he 
had 
long 
been 
waiting 
for 
her 
to 
come. 
He
twitched 
her 
hand, 
and 
his 
brows 
and 
lips 
quivered 
angrily.

She 
looked 
at 
him 
in 
dismay 
trying 
to 
guess 
what<p>
he 
wanted 
of 
her. 
When
she 
changed 
her 
position 
so 
that 
his 
left 
eye 
could 
see 
her 
face 
he
calmed 
down, 
not 
taking 
his 
eyes 
off 
her 
for 
some 
seconds. 
Then 
<a href="/aVzUge/ugX4It21Fv.html">his</a> 
lips
and

moved, 
sounds

he 
began 
to 
speak, 
gazing 
timidly 
and
imploringly 
at 
her, 
evidently 
afraid 
that 
she 
might 
not 
understand.

Straining 
all 
her 
faculties 
Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
him. 
The 
comic
efforts 
with 
which 
he 
moved 
his 
tongue 
made 
her 
drop 
her 
eyes 
and 
with
difficulty 
repress 
the 
sobs 
that 
rose 
to 
her 
throat. 
He 
said 
something,
repeating 
the 
same 
words 
several 
times. 
She 
could 
not 
understand 
them,
but 
tried 
to 
guess 
what 
he 
was 
saying 
and 
inquiringly 
repeated 
the 
words
he 
uttered.

"Mmm...ar...ate...ate..." 
he 
repeated 
several 
times.

It 
was 
quite 
impossible 
to 
understand 
these 
sounds. 
The 
doctor 
thought
he 
had 
guessed 
them, 
and 
inquiringly 
repeated: 
"Mary, 
are 
you 
afraid?"
The 
prince 
shook 
his 
head, 
again 
repeated 
the 
same 
sounds.

"My 
mind, 
my 
mind 
aches?" 
questioned 
Princess 
Mary.

He 
made 
a 
mumbling 
sound 
in 
confirmation 
of 
this, 
took 
her 
hand, 
and
began 
pressing 
it 
to 
different 
parts 
of 
his 
breast 
as 
if 
trying 
to 
find
the 
right 
place 
for 
it.

"Always 
thoughts... 
about 
you... 
thoughts..." 
he 
then 
uttered 
much
more 
clearly 
than 
he 
had 
done 
before, 
now 
that 
he 
was 
sure 
of 
being
understood.

Princess 
Mary 
pressed 
her 
head 
against 
his 
hand, 
trying<p>
to 
hide 
her 
sobs
and 
tears.

He 
moved 
his 
hand 
over 
her 
hair.

"I

Little 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
education, 
her 
brother 
Andrew, 
and 
religion
were 
Princess 
Mary's 
joys 
and 
consolations; 
but 
besides 
that, 
since
everyone 
must 
have 
personal 
hopes, 
Princess 
Mary 
in 
the 
profoundest
depths 
of 
her 
heart 
had 
a 
hidden 
dream 
and 
hope 
that 
supplied 
the 
chief
consolation 
of 
her 
life. 
This 
comforting 
dream 
and 
hope 
were 
given 
her
by 
God's 
folk-the 
half-witted<p>
and 
other 
pilgrims 
who 
visited
her 
without 
the 
prince's 
knowledge. 
The 
longer 
she 
lived, 
the 
more
experience 
and 
observation 
she 
had 
of 
life, 
the 
greater 
was 
her 
wonder
at 
the 
short-sightedness 
of 
men 
who 
seek 
enjoyment 
and 
happiness 
here
on 
earth: 
toiling, 
suffering, 
struggling, 
and 
harming 
one 
another, 
to
obtain 
that 
impossible, 
visionary, 
sinful 
happiness. 
Prince 
Andrew 
had
loved 
his 
wife, 
she 
died, 
but 
that 
was 
not 
enough: 
he 
wanted 
to 
bind
his 
happiness 
to 
another 
woman. 
Her 
father 
objected 
to 
this 
because 
he
wanted 
a 
more 
distinguished 
and 
wealthier 
match 
for 
Andrew. 
And 
they
all 
struggled 
and 
suffered 
and 
tormented 
one 
another 
and 
injured 
their
souls, 
their 
eternal 
souls, 
for 
the 
attainment 
of 
benefits 
which 
endure
but 
for<p>
an 
instant. 
Not 
only 
do 
we 
know 
this 
ourselves, 
but 
Christ, 
the
Son 
of 
God, 
came 
down 
to 
earth 
and 
told 
us 
that 
this 
life 
is 
but 
for
a 
moment 
and 
is 
a 
probation; 
yet 
we 
cling 
to 
it 
and 
think 
to 
find
happiness 
in 
it. 
"How 
is 
it 
that 
no 
one 
realizes 
this?" 
thought
Princess 
Mary. 
"No 
one 
except 
these 
despised 
God's 
folk 
who, 
wallet
on 
back, 
come 
to 
me 
by 
the 
back 
door, 
afraid 
of 
being 
seen 
by 
the
prince, 
not 
for 
fear 
of 
ill-usage

him 
but 
for 
fear 
of 
causing 
him
to 
sin. 
To

all 
the 
cares 
of 
worldly 
welfare, 
in

He

a

his

The

a

more

rose

porch

a 
veranda.

"Come,

argue 
then,"

"You 
talk 
of
schools," 
he 
went

crooking 
a

so 
forth;

want

to 
a

passed 
by

taking 
off

"from

animal

the

him,

you 
want 
to

what 
I 
am, 
without 
giving 
him 
my
means. 
Then 
you 
say, 
'lighten 
his

But 
as 
I 
see 
it, 
physical
labor 
is 
as 
essential 
to 
him, 
as 
much 
a 
condition 
of 
his

as

is 
to 
you

me.

the

come

I 
can't 
sleep

because 
I 
think 
and 
can't 
help 
thinking, 
just 
as
he 
can't 
help 
plowing

mowing; 
if 
he 
didn't, 
he 
would 
go 
to 
the

shop 
or 
fall 
ill. 
Just 
as 
I 
could 
not 
stand 
his 
terrible 
physical
labor 
but 
should 
die 
of 
it 
in 
a 
week, 
so 
he 
could 
not 
stand 
my 
physical
idleness, 
but 
would 
grow 
fat 
and 
die. 
The 
third 
thing-what 
else

it 
you 
talked 
about?" 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
crooked 
a 
third 
finger. 
"Ah,

medicine. 
He

a

you

then 
Julie, 
who 
by 
the
death 
of 
her 
brothers 
had 
become 
one 
of 
the 
richest 
heiresses 
in 
Moscow,
was 
in 
the 
full 
whirl 
of 
society 
pleasures. 
She 
was 
surrounded<p>
by 
young
men 
who, 
she 
fancied, 
had 
suddenly 
learned 
to 
appreciate 
her 
worth.
Julie 
was 
at 
that 
stage 
in 
the 
life 
of 
a 
society 
woman 
when 
she 
feels
that 
her 
last 
chance 
of 
marrying 
has 
come 
and 
that 
her 
fate 
must 
be
decided<p>
now 
or 
never. 
On 
Thursdays 
Princess 
Mary 
remembered 
with 
a
mournful 
smile 
that 
she 
now 
had 
no 
one 
to 
write 
to, 
since 
Julie-whose
presence 
gave 
her 
no 
pleasure 
was 
here 
and 
they 
met 
every 
week. 
Like 
the
old 
emigre 
who 
declined 
to 
marry 
the 
lady 
with 
whom 
he<p>
had 
spent 
his
evenings 
for 
years, 
she 
regretted 
Julie's 
presence 
and 
having 
no 
one
to 
write 
to. 
In 
Moscow 
Princess 
Mary 
had 
no 
one 
to 
talk 
to, 
no 
one 
to
whom 
to 
confide 
her 
sorrow, 
and 
much 
sorrow 
fell 
to 
her 
lot 
just 
then.
The 
time 
for 
Prince 
Andrew's 
return 
and 
marriage 
was 
approaching, 
but
his 
request 
to 
her 
to 
prepare 
his 
father 
for 
it 
had 
not 
been 
carried
out; 
in 
fact, 
it 
seemed 
as 
if 
matters 
were 
quite 
hopeless, 
for 
at 
every
mention 
of 
the 
young 
Countess 
Rostova 
the 
old 
prince 
(who 
apart 
from
that 
was 
usually 
in 
a 
bad 
temper) 
lost 
control 
of 
himself. 
Another
lately 
added 
sorrow 
arose 
from 
the 
lessons 
she 
gave 
her 
six 
year-old
nephew. 
To 
her 
consternation 
she 
detected 
in 
herself 
in 
relation 
to
little 
Nicholas 
some 
symptoms 
of 
her 
father's 
irritability. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tB1yf8C0UJpiB.html">However
often</a> 
she 
told 
herself 
that 
she 
must 
not 
get 
irritable 
when 
teaching 
her
nephew, 
almost 
every 
time 
that, 
pointer<p>
in 
hand, 
she 
sat 
down 
to 
show
him 
the 
French 
alphabet, 
she 
so 
longed 
to 
pour 
her 
own 
knowledge 
quickly
and 
easily 
into 
the 
child-who 
was 
already 
afraid 
that 
Auntie 
might 
at
any 
moment 
get 
angry-that 
at 
his 
slightest 
inattention 
she 
trembled,
became 
flustered 
and 
heated, 
raised 
her 
voice, 
and 
sometimes 
pulled 
him
by 
the 
arm 
and 
put 
him 
in 
the<p>
corner. 
Having 
put 
him 
in 
the 
corner
she 
would 
herself 
begin 
to 
cry 
over 
her 
cruel, 
evil 
nature, 
and 
little
Nicholas, 
following 
her 
example, 
would 
sob, 
and 
without 
permission 
would
leave 
his 
corner, 
come 
to 
her, 
pull 
her 
wet 
hands 
from 
her 
face, 
and
comfort 
her. 
<a href="/cZl/xX2z6Jk3Cr.html">But</a> 
what 
distressed 
the 
princess 
most 
of 
all 
was 
her
father's 
irritability, 
which 
was 
always 
directed 
against 
her 
and 
had
of 
late 
amounted 
to 
cruelty. 
Had 
he 
forced 
her 
to 
prostrate 
herself 
to
the 
ground 
all 
night, 
had 
he 
beaten 
her

made 
her 
fetch

or 
water,
it 
would 
never 
have 
entered 
her 
mind 
to 
think 
her 
position 
hard; 
but
this 
loving 
despot-the 
more 
cruel 
because 
he 
loved 
her 
and 
for 
that
reason 
tormented 
himself 
and 
her-knew 
how 
not 
merely 
to 
hurt 
and
humiliate 
her 
deliberately,

show 
her

CHAPTER 
XXXVI

Prince 
Andrew's 
regiment 
was 
among 
the 
reserves 
which 
till 
after 
one
o'clock 
were 
stationed 
inactive 
behind 
Semenovsk, 
under 
heavy 
artillery
fire. 
Toward 
two 
o'clock 
the 
regiment, 
having 
already 
lost 
more 
than
two 
hundred 
men, 
was 
moved 
forward 
into 
a 
trampled 
oatfield 
in 
the 
gap
between 
Semenovsk 
and 
the 
Knoll 
Battery, 
where 
thousands 
of 
men 
perished
that 
day 
and 
on 
which 
an 
intense, 
concentrated 
fire 
from 
several 
hundred
enemy 
guns 
was 
directed 
between 
one 
and 
two 
o'clock.

Without 
moving 
from 
that 
spot 
or 
firing 
a 
single 
shot 
the 
regiment 
here
lost 
another 
third 
of 
its 
men. 
From 
in 
front 
and 
especially 
from 
the
right, 
in 
the 
unlifting 
smoke 
the 
guns 
boomed, 
and 
out 
of 
the 
mysterious
domain 
of 
smoke 
that 
overlay 
the 
whole 
space 
in 
front, 
quick 
hissing
cannon 
balls 
and 
slow 
whistling 
shells 
flew 
unceasingly. 
At 
times, 
as
if 
to 
allow 
them 
a 
respite, 
a 
quarter 
of 
an 
hour 
passed 
during 
which
the 
cannon 
balls 
and 
shells 
all 
flew 
overhead, 
but 
sometimes 
several 
men
were 
torn 
from 
the 
regiment 
in 
a 
minute 
and 
the 
slain 
were 
continually

dragged 
away

gates 
of 
most</h1>of 
the 
houses
were 
locked 
and 
the 
shutters 
up. 
The 
streets 
and 
lanes 
were 
deserted.
The 
air 
was 
full 
of 
smoke 
and 
the 
smell 
of 
burning. 
Now 
and 
then 
he 
met
Russians 
with 
anxious 
and 
timid 
faces, 
and 
Frenchmen 
with 
an 
air 
not 
of
the 
city 
but 
of 
the 
camp, 
walking 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
streets. 
Both
the 
Russians 
and 
the 
French 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
surprise. 
Besides 
his
height 
and 
stoutness, 
and 
the 
strange 
morose 
look 
of 
suffering 
in 
his
face 
and 
whole 
figure, 
the 
Russians 
stared 
at 
Pierre 
because 
they 
could
not 
make 
out 
to 
what 
class 
he 
could 
belong. 
The 
French 
followed<p>
him 
with
astonishment 
in 
their 
eyes 
chiefly 
because 
Pierre, 
unlike 
all 
the
other 
Russians 
who 
gazed 
at 
the 
French 
with 
fear 
and 
curiosity, 
paid 
no
attention 
to 
them. 
At 
the 
gate 
of 
one 
house 
three 
Frenchmen, 
who 
were
explaining 
something 
to 
some 
Russians 
who 
did 
not 
understand 
them,
stopped 
Pierre 
asking 
if 
he 
did 
not 
know 
French.

Pierre 
shook 
his 
head 
and 
went 
on. 
In 
another 
side 
street 
a 
sentinel
standing 
beside 
a 
green 
caisson 
shouted 
at 
him, 
but 
only 
when 
the<p>
shout
was 
threateningly 
repeated 
and 
he 
heard 
the 
click 
of 
the 
man's 
musket 
as
he 
raised 
it 
did 
Pierre 
understand 
that 
he 
had 
to 
pass 
on 
the 
other 
side
of 
the 
street. 
He 
heard 
nothing 
and 
saw 
nothing 
of 
what 
went 
on 
around
him. 
He 
carried 
his 
resolution 
within 
himself 
in 
terror 
and 
haste, 
like
something 
dreadful 
and 
alien 
to 
him, 
for, 
after 
the 
previous 
night's
experience, 
he 
was 
afraid 
of<p>
losing 
it. 
But<p>
he 
was 
not 
destined 
to 
bring
his 
mood 
safely 
to 
his 
destination. 
And 
even 
had 
he 
not 
been 
hindered 
by
anything 
on 
the 
way, 
his 
intention 
could 
not 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak2v5mbEd1ahj.html">now</a> 
have 
been 
carried 
out,
for 
Napoleon 
had 
passed 
the 
Arbat 
more 
than 
four 
hours 
previously 
on 
his
way 
from 
the 
Dorogomilov 
suburb 
to 
the 
Kremlin, 
and 
was 
now 
sitting 
in
a 
very 
gloomy 
frame 
of 
mind 
in 
a 
royal 
study 
in 
the 
Kremlin, 
giving
detailed 
and 
exact 
orders 
as 
to 
measures 
to 
be 
taken 
immediately
to 
extinguish 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/jl2O0Vd6Yg.html">fire,</a> 
to 
prevent 
looting, 
and 
to 
reassure 
the
inhabitants. 
But 
Pierre 
did 
not 
know 
this; 
he 
was 
entirely 
absorbed
in 
what 
lay 
before 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SL6ej5WVP7nZs.html">him,</a> 
and 
was<p>
tortured-as 
those 
are 
who 
obstinately
undertake 
a 
task 
that 
is 
impossible 
for 
them 
not 
because 
of 
its
difficulty 
but 
because 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tHL2iU9hxx7.html">of</a> 
its 
incompatibility 
with 
their 
natures-by 
the
fear 
of 
weakening 
at 
the 
decisive 
moment 
and 
so 
losing 
his 
self-esteem.

Though 
he 
heard 
and 
saw 
nothing 
around 
him 
he 
found 
his 
way 
by 
instinct
and 
did 
not 
go 
wrong 
in 
the 
side 
streets 
that 
led<p>
to 
the 
Povarskoy.

As 
Pierre 
approached 
that 
street 
the 
smoke 
became 
denser 
and 
denser-he
even 
felt 
the 
heat 
of 
the 
fire. 
Occasionally 
curly 
tongues 
of 
flame 
rose
from 
under 
the 
roofs 
of 
the 
houses. 
He 
met 
more 
people 
in 
the 
streets
and 
they 
were 
more 
excited. 
But 
Pierre, 
though 
he 
felt 
that 
something
unusual 
was 
happening 
around 
him, 
did 
not 
realize 
that 
he 
was
approaching 
the 
fire. 
As 
he 
was 
going 
along 
a 
footpath 
across 
a
wide-open 
space 
adjoining 
<a href="/aVzUge/Bx6b5BYyw6v.html">the</a> 
Povarskoy 
on 
one 
side 
and 
the 
gardens
of 
Prince 
Gruzinski's 
house 
on 
the<p>
other, 
Pierre 
suddenly 
heard 
the
desperate 
weeping 
of 
a 
woman 
close 
to 
him. 
He 
stopped 
as 
if 
awakening
from 
a 
dream 
and 
lifted 
his 
head.

By 
the 
side 
of 
the 
path, 
on 
the 
dusty 
dry 
grass, 
all 
sorts 
of 
household
goods 
lay 
in 
a 
heap: 
featherbeds, 
a 
samovar, 
icons, 
and 
trunks. 
On 
the
ground, 
beside 
the 
trunks, 
sat 
a 
thin 
woman 
no 
longer 
young, 
with 
long,
prominent 
upper 
teeth, 
and 
wearing 
a 
black 
cloak 
and 
cap. 
This<p>
woman,
swaying 
to 
and 
fro 
and 
muttering 
something, 
was 
choking

She 
could 
not
sleep 
and 
several 
times 
went 
to 
the 
door 
and 
listened, 
wishing 
to 
enter
but 
not 
deciding 
to 
do 
so. 
Though 
he 
did 
not 
speak, 
Princess 
Mary 
saw
and 
knew 
how 
unpleasant 
every 
sign 
of 
anxiety<p>
on 
his 
account 
was 
to 
him.
She 
had 
noticed 
with 
what 
dissatisfaction 
he 
turned 
from 
the 
look 
she
sometimes 
involuntarily 
fixed 
on 
him. 
She 
knew 
that 
her 
going 
in 
during
the 
night 
at 
an 
unusual 
hour 
would 
irritate 
him.

But 
never 
had 
she 
felt 
so 
grieved 
for 
him 
or 
so 
much 
afraid 
of 
losing
him. 
She 
recalled 
all 
her 
life 
with 
him 
and 
in 
every 
word 
and 
act 
of 
his
found 
an 
expression 
of 
his 
love 
of 
her. 
Occasionally 
amid 
these 
memories
temptations 
of 
the 
devil 
would 
surge 
into 
her 
imagination: 
thoughts 
of
how 
things 
would 
be 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ga8Qc63.html">after</a><p>
his 
death, 
and 
how 
her 
new, 
liberated 
life
would 
be 
ordered. 
But 
she 
drove 
these 
thoughts 
away 
with 
disgust. 
Toward
morning 
he 
became 
quiet 
and 
she 
fell 
asleep.

She 
woke 
late. 
That 
sincerity 
which 
often 
comes 
with 
waking 
showed 
her
clearly 
what 
chiefly 
concerned 
her 
about 
her 
father's 
illness. 
On 
waking
she 
listened 
to 
what 
was 
going 
on 
behind 
<a href="/cZl/yQ5GSfdQ2zmeD7npky.html">the</a> 
door 
and, 
hearing 
him
groan, 
said 
to 
herself 
with 
a 
sigh 
that 
things 
were 
still 
the 
same.

"But 
what 
could 
have 
happened? 
What 
did 
I 
want? 
I 
want 
his 
death!" 
she
cried 
with 
a 
feeling 
of 
loathing 
for 
herself.

She 
washed, 
dressed,<p>
said 
her 
prayers, 
and 
went 
out 
to 
the 
porch. 
In
front 
of 
it 
stood 
carriages 
without 
horses 
and 
things 
were 
being 
packed
into 
the 
vehicles.

It 
was 
a 
warm, 
gray 
morning. 
Princess 
Mary 
stopped 
at 
the 
porch, 
still
horrified 
by 
her 
spiritual 
baseness 
and 
trying 
to 
arrange 
her 
thoughts
before 
going 
to 
her 
father. 
The 
doctor 
came 
downstairs 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Hi3AF3G4KqZP.html">and</a> 
went 
out 
to
her.

"He 
is 
a 
little 
better 
today," 
said 
he. 
"I 
was 
looking 
for 
you. 
One 
can
make 
out 
something 
of 
what 
he 
is 
saying. 
His 
head 
is 
clearer. 
Come 
in,
he 
is 
asking 
for 
you...."

Princess 
Mary's 
heart 
beat 
so 
violently 
at 
this 
news 
that 
she 
grew 
pale
and 
leaned 
against 
the 
wall 
to 
keep 
from 
falling. 
To 
see 
him, 
talk 
to
him, 
feel 
his 
eyes 
on 
her 
now 
that 
her 
whole 
soul 
was 
overflowing 
with
those 
dreadful, 
wicked 
temptations, 
was 
a 
torment 
of 
joy 
and 
terror.

"Come," 
said 
the 
doctor.

Princess 
Mary 
entered 
her 
father's 
room 
and 
went 
up 
to 
his 
bed. 
He 
was
lying 
on 
his 
back 
propped 
up 
high, 
and 
his 
small 
bony 
hands 
with
their 
knotted 
purple 
veins 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
quilt; 
his 
left 
eye 
gazed
straight 
before 
him, 
his 
right 
eye 
was 
awry, 
and 
his 
brows 
and<p>
lips
motionless. 
He 
seemed 
altogether 
so 
thin, 
small, 
and 
pathetic. 
His 
face
seemed 
to 
have 
shriveled 
or 
melted; 
his 
features 
had 
grown 
smaller.
Princess 
Mary 
went 
up 
and 
kissed 
his 
hand. 
His 
left 
hand 
pressed 
hers
so 
that 
she 
understood 
that 
he 
had 
long 
been 
waiting 
for 
her 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/di27Uijd.html">to</a> 
come. 
He
twitched 
her 
hand, 
and 
his 
brows<p>
and 
lips 
quivered 
angrily.

She 
looked 
at 
him 
in 
dismay 
trying 
to 
guess 
what 
he 
wanted 
of 
her. 
When
she 
changed 
her 
position 
so 
that 
his 
left 
eye 
could 
see 
her 
face 
he
calmed 
down, 
not 
taking 
his 
eyes 
off 
her 
for 
some 
seconds. 
Then 
his 
lips
and 
tongue 
moved, 
sounds 
came, 
and 
he 
began 
to 
speak, 
gazing 
timidly 
and
imploringly 
at 
her, 
evidently 
afraid 
that 
she 
might 
not 
understand.

Straining 
all 
her 
faculties 
Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
him. 
The 
comic
efforts 
with 
which 
he 
moved 
his 
tongue 
made 
her 
drop 
her 
eyes 
and 
with
difficulty 
repress 
the 
sobs 
that 
rose 
to 
her 
throat. 
He 
said 
something,
repeating 
the 
same 
words 
several 
times. 
She 
could 
not 
understand 
them,
but 
tried 
to 
guess 
what 
he 
was 
saying 
and 
inquiringly 
repeated 
the 
words
he 
uttered.

"Mmm...ar...ate...ate..." 
he 
repeated 
several 
times.

It 
was 
quite 
impossible 
to 
understand 
these 
sounds. 
The 
doctor 
thought
he 
had 
guessed 
them, 
and 
inquiringly 
repeated: 
"Mary, 
are 
<a href="/cZl/Uy6yuV92tQp.html">you</a> 
afraid?"
The 
prince 
shook 
his 
head,

Prince

asked:

Alpatych,

the

to 
their 
departure 
for
Bogucharovo, 
replied 
that 
they 
had 
left 
on 
the

and 
again<p>
went
into 
details 
concerning 
the

asking 
for

he 
inquired.

"What

thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
down 
on 
the
old 
man's 
bald 
head 
shining 
in 
the 
sun 
and 
seeing 
by 
the 
expression 
on
his 
face 
that 
the 
old 
man 
himself 
understood 
how 
untimely 
such 
questions
were 
and 
only 
asked<p>
them 
to 
allay 
his 
grief.

"Yes, 
let 
them 
have 
it," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew.

"If 
you 
noticed 
some 
disorder 
in 
the 
garden," 
said 
Alpatych, 
"it 
was
impossible 
to 
prevent 
it. 
Three 
regiments 
have 
been 
here 
and 
spent
the 
night, 
dragoons 
mostly. 
I 
took

"Well,

Will

asked 
Prince 
Andrew.

Alpatych 
turned 
his 
face 
to<p>
Prince 
Andrew, 
looked 
at 
him, 
and 
suddenly
with 
a 
solemn 
gesture 
raised 
his 
arm.

"He 
is 
my 
refuge! 
His 
will 
be 
done!" 
he 
exclaimed.

A 
group 
of 
bareheaded 
peasants 
was 
approaching 
across 
the 
meadow 
toward
the 
prince.

"Well, 
good-by!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
<a href="/cZl/SU1Kc94YE.html">bending</a> 
over

"You

Alpatych 
clung 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
leg 
and 
burst 
into 
sobs. 
Gently
disengaging 
himself, 
the 
prince 
spurred 
his 
horse 
and 
rode 
down 
the
avenue 
at 
a 
gallop.

The

CHAPTER 
VI

The 
duel 
between 
Pierre 
and 
Dolokhov 
was 
hushed 
up 
and, 
in 
spite 
of
the 
Emperor's 
severity 
regarding 
duels 
at 
that 
time, 
neither 
the
principals 
nor 
their 
seconds 
suffered 
for 
it.<p>
But 
the 
story 
of 
the 
duel,
confirmed 
by<p>
Pierre's 
rupture 
with 
his 
wife, 
was 
the 
talk 
of<p>
society.
Pierre 
who 
had 
been 
regarded 
with 
patronizing 
condescension 
when 
he 
was
an 
illegitimate 
son, 
and 
petted 
and 
extolled 
when 
he 
was 
the 
best
match 
in 
Russia, 
had 
sunk 
greatly 
in 
the 
esteem 
of 
society 
after 
his
marriage-when 
the 
marriageable 
daughters 
and 
their 
mothers 
had 
nothing
to 
hope 
from 
him-especially 
as 
he 
did 
not 
know 
how, 
and 
did 
not
wish, 
to 
court 
society's 
favor. 
Now 
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Fcn8HQTp6BPULq5fOHvf.html">alone</a> 
was 
blamed 
for 
what 
had
happened, 
he 
was 
said 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Li3a6l4X.html">be</a> 
insanely 
jealous 
and 
subject 
like 
his
father 
to 
fits 
of 
bloodthirsty 
rage. 
And 
when<p>
after 
Pierre's
departure 
Helene 
returned 
to 
Petersburg, 
she 
was 
received 
by 
all 
her
acquaintances 
not 
only 
cordially, 
but 
even 
with 
a 
shade 
of 
deference
due 
to 
her 
misfortune. 
When 
conversation 
turned 
on 
her 
husband 
Helene
assumed 
a 
dignified 
expression, 
which 
with 
characteristic 
tact 
she 
had
acquired 
though 
she 
did 
not 
understand 
its 
significance. 
This 
expression
suggested 
that 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/njR9fLYk6NSUp5Url.html">she</a> 
had 
resolved 
to 
endure 
her 
troubles 
uncomplainingly
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/wd8YyaBP8mTUVM0.html">that</a> 
her 
husband 
was 
a 
cross 
laid 
upon 
her 
by 
God. 
Prince 
Vasili
expressed 
his 
opinion 
more 
openly. 
He 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders 
when 
Pierre
was 
mentioned 
and, 
pointing 
to 
his 
forehead, 
remarked:

"A 
bit 
touched-I 
always 
said 
so."

"I 
said 
from 
the 
first," 
declared 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
referring 
to
Pierre, 
"I 
said 
at 
the 
time 
and 
before 
anyone 
else" 
(she 
insisted
on 
her 
priority) 
"that 
that 
senseless 
young 
man 
was 
spoiled 
by 
the
depraved 
ideas 
of 
these 
days. 
I 
said 
so 
even 
at 
the 
time 
when 
everybody
was 
in 
raptures 
about 
him, 
when 
he 
had 
just 
returned 
from 
abroad, 
and
when, 
if 
you 
remember, 
he 
posed 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
Marat 
at 
one 
of 
my 
soirees.
And 
how 
has 
it 
ended? 
I 
was 
against 
this 
marriage 
even 
then 
and 
foretold
all 
that 
has 
happened."

commands, 
were 
related 
to</h1>events, 
historians 
have 
assumed
that 
the 
events 
depended 
on 
those 
commands. 
But 
examining 
the 
events
themselves 
and 
the 
connection 
in 
which 
the 
historical 
persons 
stood 
to
the 
people, 
we 
have 
found 
that 
they<p>
and 
their 
orders 
were 
dependent 
on
events. 
The 
incontestable 
proof 
of 
this 
deduction 
is 
that, 
however 
many
commands 
were 
issued, 
the 
event 
does<p>
not 
take 
place 
unless 
there 
are
other 
causes 
for 
it, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
an 
event 
occurs-be 
it 
what 
it
may-then 
out 
of 
all 
the 
continually 
expressed 
wishes 
of 
different 
people
some 
will 
always 
be 
found 
which 
by 
their 
meaning 
and 
their 
time 
of
utterance 
are 
related 
as 
commands 
to 
the 
events.

Arriving 
at 
this 
conclusion 
we 
can 
reply 
directly 
and 
positively 
to
these 
two 
essential 
questions 
of 
history:

(1) 
What 
is 
power?

(2) 
What 
force 
produces 
the 
movement 
of 
the<p>
nations?

(1) 
Power 
is 
the 
relation 
of 
a 
given 
person 
to 
other 
individuals,
in 
which 
the 
more 
this 
person 
expresses 
opinions, 
predictions, 
and
justifications 
of 
the 
collective 
action 
that 
is 
performed, 
the 
less 
is
his 
participation 
in 
that 
action.

(2) 
The 
movement 
of 
nations 
is 
caused 
not 
by 
power, 
nor 
by 
intellectual
activity, 
nor<p>
even 
by 
a 
combination 
of 
the 
two 
as 
historians 
have
supposed, 
but 
by 
the 
activity 
of 
all 
the 
people 
who 
participate 
in
the 
events, 
and 
who 
always 
combine 
in 
such 
a 
way 
that 
those 
taking
the 
largest 
direct 
share 
in 
the 
event 
take 
on 
themselves 
the 
least
responsibility 
and 
vice 
versa.

Morally 
the 
wielder 
of 
power 
appears 
to 
cause 
the 
event; 
physically
it 
is 
those 
who 
submit 
to 
the 
power. 
But 
as 
the 
moral 
activity 
is
inconceivable 
without 
the 
physical, 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
event 
is 
neither 
in
the 
one 
nor 
in 
the 
other 
but

CHAPTER 
XX

Pierre 
did 
not 
stay 
for 
dinner, 
but 
left<p>
the 
room 
and 
went 
away 
at 
once.
He 
drove 
through 
the 
town 
seeking 
Anatole 
Kuragin, 
at 
the 
thought 
of
whom 
now 
the 
blood 
rushed 
to 
his 
heart 
and 
he 
felt 
a 
difficulty 
in
breathing. 
He 
was 
not 
at 
the 
ice 
hills, 
nor 
at 
the 
gypsies', 
nor 
at
Komoneno's. 
Pierre 
drove 
to 
the 
Club. 
In 
the 
Club 
all 
was 
going 
on 
as
usual. 
The 
members 
who 
were 
assembling 
for 
dinner 
were 
sitting 
about
in 
groups; 
they 
greeted 
Pierre 
and 
spoke 
of 
the 
town 
news. 
The 
footman
having 
greeted 
him, 
knowing 
his 
habits 
and 
his 
acquaintances, 
told 
him
there 
was 
a 
place 
left 
for 
him 
in 
the 
small 
dining 
room 
and 
that 
Prince
Michael 
Zakharych 
was 
in 
the 
library, 
but 
Paul 
Timofeevich 
had 
not 
yet
arrived. 
One 
of 
Pierre's 
acquaintances, 
while 
they 
were 
talking 
about
the 
weather, 
asked 
if 
he 
had<p>
heard 
of 
Kuragin's 
abduction 
of 
Rostova
which 
was 
talked 
of 
in 
the 
town, 
and 
was 
it 
true? 
Pierre 
laughed 
and
said 
it 
was 
nonsense 
for 
he 
had 
just 
come 
from 
the 
Rostovs'. 
He 
asked
everyone 
about 
Anatole. 
One 
man 
told 
him 
he 
had 
not 
come 
yet, 
and
another 
that 
he 
was 
coming 
to 
dinner.<p>
Pierre 
felt 
it 
strange 
to 
see 
this
calm, 
indifferent 
crowd 
of 
people 
unaware 
of 
what 
was 
going 
on 
in 
his
soul. 
He 
paced<p>
through 
the 
ballroom, 
waited 
till 
everyone 
had 
come, 
and
as 
Anatole 
had 
not 
turned 
up 
did 
not 
stay 
for 
dinner 
but 
drove 
home.

Anatole, 
for 
whom 
Pierre 
was 
looking, 
dined 
that 
day 
with 
Dolokhov,
consulting 
him 
as 
to 
how 
to 
remedy 
this 
unfortunate 
affair. 
It 
seemed 
to
him 
essential 
to 
see 
Natasha. 
In 
the 
evening 
he 
drove 
to 
his 
sister's
to 
discuss 
with 
her 
how 
to 
arrange 
a 
meeting. 
When 
Pierre 
returned 
home
after 
vainly 
hunting 
all 
over 
Moscow, 
his 
valet 
informed 
him 
that 
Prince
Anatole 
was 
with 
the 
countess. 
The 
countess' 
drawing 
room 
was 
full 
of
guests.

Pierre 
without 
greeting 
his 
wife 
whom 
he 
had 
not 
seen 
since 
his
return-at 
that 
moment 
she 
was 
more 
repulsive 
to 
him 
than 
ever-entered
the 
drawing 
room 
and 
seeing 
Anatole 
went 
up 
to 
him.

"Ah, 
Pierre," 
said 
the 
countess 
going 
up 
to 
her 
husband. 
"You 
don't 
know
what 
a 
plight 
our 
Anatole..."

She 
stopped, 
seeing 
in 
the 
forward 
thrust 
of 
her 
husband's 
head, 
in 
his
glowing 
eyes 
and 
his 
resolute 
gait, 
the 
terrible 
indications 
of 
that
rage 
and 
strength 
which 
she 
knew 
and 
had 
herself 
experienced 
after 
his
duel 
with 
Dolokhov.

"Where 
you 
are, 
there 
is 
vice 
and 
evil!" 
said 
Pierre 
to 
his 
wife.
"Anatole, 
come 
with 
me! 
I 
must 
speak 
to 
you," 
he 
added 
in 
French.

Anatole 
glanced 
round 
at 
his 
sister 
and 
rose 
submissively,<p>
ready 
to
follow 
Pierre. 
Pierre, 
taking 
him 
by 
the 
arm, 
pulled 
him 
toward 
himself
and 
was 
leading 
him 
from 
the 
room.

<a href="/cZl/Xo4fU44vb.html">of</a>

In

a

In<p>

In 
ten 
minutes 
the

On

And 
not

Petya

"Only,

hopelessly. 
"Are

an

"If

(he

"you'll

That

Then

said
gaily, 
with 
a 
wide 
swing 
of 
his 
arm.

"Yes, 
the 
ham 
was 
just 
delicious..." 
answered 
another 
with 
a 
loud
laugh. 
And 
they, 
too, 
passed 
on, 
so 
that 
Nesvitski 
did 
not 
learn 
who
had 
been 
struck 
on 
the

or 
what 
the 
ham 
had 
to 
do 
with 
it.

"Bah!

He

a

angrily

reproachfully.

"As

a

is
time 
to 
get 
on," 
he 
added, 
and, 
stepping 
off 
the 
raft, 
he 
looked 
up
at 
the 
sky 
to 
which 
Pierre 
had 
pointed, 
and 
for 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/HK3WVP4FWU2At.html">first</a> 
time 
since
Austerlitz 
saw 
that 
high, 
everlasting 
sky 
he 
had 
seen 
while 
lying 
on
that 
battlefield; 
and 
something 
that 
had 
long 
been 
slumbering, 
something
that 
was 
best 
within 
him, 
suddenly<p>
awoke, 
joyful 
and 
youthful, 
in 
his
soul. 
It 
vanished 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
returned 
to 
the 
customary 
conditions
of 
his 
life, 
but 
he 
knew 
that 
this 
feeling 
which 
he 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to
develop 
existed 
within 
him. 
His 
meeting 
with 
Pierre 
formed 
an 
epoch 
in
Prince 
Andrew's 
life. 
Though 
outwardly 
he 
continued 
to 
live 
in 
the
same 
old 
way, 
inwardly 
he 
began 
a 
new 
life.





CHAPTER 
XIII

It 
was 
getting 
dusk 
when 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
Pierre 
drove 
up 
to 
the 
front
entrance 
of 
the 
house 
at 
Bald<p>
Hills. 
As 
they 
approached 
the 
house,
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
a 
smile 
drew 
Pierre's 
attention 
to 
a 
commotion
going 
on 
at 
the 
back 
porch. 
A 
woman, 
bent 
with 
age, 
with 
a 
wallet 
on 
her
back, 
and 
a 
short, 
long-haired, 
young 
man

nothing 
vanishes 
in 
this

but 
that 
I 
shall 
always 
exist 
and 
always 
have 
existed. 
I 
feel
that 
beyond 
me 
and 
above 
me 
there 
are 
spirits, 
and 
that 
in 
this 
world
there 
is 
truth."

"Yes, 
that 
is 
Herder's 
theory," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"but 
it 
is
not 
that 
which 
can 
convince 
me, 
dear 
friend-life 
and 
death 
are 
what
convince. 
What 
convinces 
is 
when 
one 
sees 
a 
being 
dear 
to 
one, 
bound
up 
with 
one's 
own 
life, 
before<p>
whom 
one 
was 
to 
blame 
and 
had 
hoped 
to
make 
it 
right" 
(Prince 
Andrew's 
voice 
trembled 
and 
he 
turned 
away),
"and 
suddenly 
that 
being 
is 
seized 
with 
pain, 
suffers, 
and 
ceases 
to
exist.... 
Why? 
It 
cannot 
be 
that 
there 
is 
no 
answer. 
And 
I 
believe 
there
is.... 
That's 
what 
convinces, 
that 
is 
what 
has 
convinced 
me," 
said
Prince 
Andrew.

"Yes, 
yes, 
of 
course," 
said 
Pierre, 
"isn't 
that 
what 
I'm
saying?"

"No. 
All 
I 
say 
is 
that 
it 
is 
not 
argument 
that 
convinces 
me 
of 
the
necessity 
of 
a 
future 
life, 
but 
this: 
when 
you 
go 
hand 
in 
hand 
with
someone 
and 
all 
at 
once 
that 
person 
vanishes 
there, 
into 
nowhere, 
and
you 
yourself 
are 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Fcn8HQTp6BPULq5fOHvf.html">left</a> 
facing 
that 
abyss, 
and 
look 
in. 
And 
I 
have 
looked
in...."

"Well, 
that's 
it 
then! 
You 
know 
that 
there 
is 
a 
there 
and 
there 
is 
a
Someone? 
There 
is 
the 
future 
life. 
The 
Someone 
is-God."

Prince 
Andrew 
did 
not 
reply. 
The 
carriage 
and 
horses 
had 
long 
since 
been
taken 
off, 
onto 
the 
farther 
bank, 
and 
reharnessed. 
The 
sun 
had 
sunk 
half
below 
the 
horizon 
and 
an 
evening 
frost 
was 
starring 
the 
puddles 
near
the 
ferry, 
but 
Pierre 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mT8QrO73Bh.html">and</a> 
Andrew, 
to 
the 
astonishment 
of 
the 
footmen,
coachmen, 
and 
ferrymen, 
still 
stood 
on 
the 
raft 
and 
talked.

"If 
there 
is 
a 
God 
and 
future 
life, 
there 
is 
truth 
and 
good, 
and
man's 
highest 
happiness 
consists 
in 
striving 
to 
attain 
them. 
We 
must
live, 
we 
must

live 
forever, 
there, 
in
the 
Whole," 
said 
Pierre, 
and 
he 
pointed 
to 
the 
sky.

Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
leaning 
on 
the 
railing 
of 
the 
raft 
listening 
to
Pierre, 
and 
he 
gazed 
with 
his 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
the 
red 
reflection 
of 
the
sun 
gleaming 
on 
the 
blue 
waters. 
There 
was 
perfect 
stillness. 
Pierre
became 
silent. 
The 
raft 
had 
long 
since 
stopped 
and 
only 
the 
waves 
of 
the
current 
beat 
softly 
against 
it 
below. 
Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
as 
if 
the 
sound
of 
the 
waves 
kept 
up 
a 
refrain 
to 
Pierre's 
words, 
whispering:

"It 
is 
true, 
believe 
it."

He 
sighed, 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/su4KqZP7zlSDj6CNkX.html">glanced</a> 
with 
a 
radiant, 
childlike,

yet 
shy 
before<p>

"Yes,

said 
Prince 
Andrew. 
"However,

much 
that

and 
even

not

place. 
If 
I 
reflect 
on 
an

still
more 
remote, 
ten 
years 
ago 
or<p>
more, 
<a href="/cZl/TD4pM2CKMN4wvJ.html">then</a> 
the 
consequences 
of 
my

are 
still 
plainer 
to 
me

I 
find 
it 
hard 
to 
imagine 
what 
would 
have
happened 
had 
that<p>
action 
not 
been 
performed. 
The 
farther 
I 
go 
back
in

or 
what 
is 
the 
same 
thing 
the 
farther 
I 
go 
forward 
in 
my
judgment, 
the 
more 
doubtful 
becomes 
my 
belief 
in 
the 
freedom 
of 
my
action.

In 
history 
we 
find 
a 
very 
similar 
progress 
of 
conviction 
concerning
the 
part 
played 
by 
free 
will 
in 
the 
general 
affairs 
of 
humanity. 
A
contemporary 
event 
seems 
to 
us 
to 
be 
indubitably 
the 
doing 
of 
all 
the
known 
participants, 
but 
with 
a 
more 
remote 
event 
we 
already 
see 
its
inevitable 
results 
which 
prevent 
our 
considering 
anything 
else 
possible.
And 
the 
farther 
we 
go 
back 
in 
examining 
events 
the 
less 
arbitrary 
do
they 
appear.

The 
Austro-Prussian 
war 
appears 
to 
us 
undoubtedly 
the 
result 
of 
the
crafty 
conduct 
of 
Bismarck, 
and 
so 
on. 
The 
Napoleonic 
wars 
still 
seem
to 
us, 
though 
already 
questionably, 
to 
be 
the 
outcome 
of 
their 
heroes'
will. 
But 
in 
the 
Crusades 
we 
already 
see 
an 
event 
occupying 
its 
definite
place 
in 
history 
and 
without 
which 
we 
cannot 
imagine 
the 
modern 
history
of 
Europe, 
though 
to 
the 
chroniclers 
of 
the 
Crusades 
that 
event 
appeared
as 
merely 
due 
to 
the 
will 
of 
certain 
people. 
In 
regard 
to 
the 
migration
of 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NY9D9lLv5g.html">peoples</a> 
it 
does 
not 
enter 
anyone's 
head 
today 
to 
suppose 
that
the 
renovation 
of 
the 
European 
world 
depended 
on 
Attila's 
caprice. 
The
farther 
back 
in 
history 
the 
object 
of 
our 
observation 
lies, 
the 
more
doubtful 
does 
the 
free 
will 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NOe8cmeax7ny4epgGc.html">of</a> 
those 
concerned 
in 
the 
event 
become 
and
the 
more 
manifest 
the 
law 
of 
inevitability.

The 
third 
consideration 
is 
the 
degree 
to 
which 
we 
apprehend 
that
endless 
chain 
of 
causation 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hj8EbhW1ej1.html">inevitably</a> 
demanded 
by 
reason, 
in 
which 
each
phenomenon 
comprehended, 
and 
therefore 
man's 
every 
action, 
must 
have
its 
definite 
place 
as 
a 
result 
of 
what 
has 
gone 
before 
and 
as 
a 
cause 
of
what

Michael 
Ivanovich, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne,

When

the

man 
in 
his 
old-age
spectacles 
and 
white 
dressing

in 
which 
<a href="/aVzUge/EX9s94vSr.html">he</a> 
received 
no

his

sat 
at 
the

He 
glanced 
round.

"Going?" 
And 
he 
went 
on 
writing.

"I've 
come 
to 
say 
good-by."

"Kiss

here," 
and 
he 
touched 
his 
cheek: 
"Thanks,

"What 
do 
you 
thank 
me 
for?"

"For

and 
not 
hanging 
to 
a 
woman's 
apron 
strings.
The 
Service 
before 
everything. 
Thanks, 
thanks!" 
And 
he 
went 
on
writing, 
so 
that 
his 
quill 
spluttered 
and 
squeaked. 
"If 
you 
have
anything 
to 
say, 
say 
it. 
These 
two 
things 
can 
be 
done 
together,"<p>
he
added.

"About

I

"Why

"When

The 
old 
prince 
stopped 
writing 
and,<p>
as 
if 
not 
understanding, 
fixed 
his
stern 
eyes 
on 
his 
son.

"I 
know 
that 
no 
one 
can 
help 
if 
nature 
does 
not 
do

said
Prince 
Andrew, 
evidently 
confused. 
"I

only 
one 
goes 
wrong, 
but 
it 
is

and 
mine. 
They 
have 
been
telling 
her 
things. 
She 
has 
had 
a

"Hm... 
Hm..." 
muttered 
the 
old 
prince 
to 
himself, 
<a href="/cZl/iY9T0hyP6qd.html">finishing</a> 
what 
he
was 
writing. 
"I'll 
do

He 
signed 
with 
a 
flourish 
and 
suddenly 
turning 
to 
his 
son 
began 
to
laugh.

"It's 
a 
bad 
business, 
eh?"

"What 
is 
bad, 
Father?"

"The 
wife!" 
said 
the 
old 
prince, 
briefly 
and 
significantly.

"I 
don't 
understand!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

"No, 
it 
can't 
be 
helped, 
lad," 
said 
the 
<a href="/cZl/lg7mk5rqw7Yg.html">prince.</a> 
"They're
all

can't 
unmarry. 
Don't 
be 
afraid; 
I 
won't

but 
you

He 
seized 
his 
son 
by 
the 
hand 
with 
small 
bony 
fingers, 
shook 
it, 
looked
straight 
into 
his 
son's 
face 
with 
keen 
eyes 
which 
seemed 
to 
see
through 
him, 
and 
again 
laughed 
his 
frigid 
laugh.

The 
son 
sighed, 
thus 
admitting 
that 
his 
father 
had 
understood 
him. 
The
old 
man 
continued 
to 
fold 
and 
seal 
his 
letter, 
snatching 
up 
and 
throwing
down 
the 
wax, 
the 
seal, 
and 
the 
paper, 
with 
his<p>
accustomed 
rapidity.

"What's 
to 
be 
done? 
She's 
pretty! 
I 
will 
do 
everything. 
Make 
your
mind 
easy," 
said 
he 
in 
abrupt 
sentences 
while 
sealing 
his 
letter.

Andrew 
did 
not 
speak; 
he 
was 
both 
pleased 
and 
displeased 
that 
his 
father
understood 
him. 
The 
old 
man 
got 
up 
and 
gave 
the 
letter 
to 
his

"Listen!"

"But 
how 
are

to 
get

Pierre 
was 
beginning.

At 
that 
moment 
Anna<p>
Pavlovna 
came 
up<p>
and, 
looking 
severely 
at 
Pierre,
asked 
the 
Italian 
how

stood

The 
Italian's
face 
instantly 
changed 
and 
assumed<p>
an 
offensively 
affected, 
sugary
expression, 
evidently 
habitual 
to 
him 
when 
conversing 
with 
women.

"I 
am 
so 
enchanted 
by 
the 
brilliancy

that 
I

not

said 
he.

Not 
letting 
the 
abbe 
and 
Pierre 
escape, 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
the 
more
conveniently 
to 
keep 
them 
under 
observation, 
brought 
them 
into 
the
larger<p>

CHAPTER 
IV

Just 
then 
another 
visitor 
entered 
the 
drawing 
room: 
Prince 
Andrew
Bolkonski, 
the 
little 
princess' 
husband. 
He 
was 
a 
very 
handsome 
young
man, 
of 
medium 
height, 
with 
firm, 
clearcut 
features. 
Everything 
about
him, 
from 
his 
weary, 
bored 
expression 
to 
his 
quiet, 
measured 
step,
offered 
a 
most 
striking 
contrast 
to 
his 
quiet, 
little 
wife. 
It 
was
evident 
that 
he 
not 
only 
knew 
everyone 
in 
the 
drawing 
room, 
but 
had
found 
them 
to 
be 
so 
tiresome 
that 
it 
wearied 
him 
to 
look 
<a href="/cZl/jM2GLq7AjGP7ws.html">at</a> 
or 
listen 
to
them. 
And 
among 
all 
these 
faces 
that 
he 
found 
so 
tedious, 
none 
seemed
to 
bore 
him 
so 
much 
as 
that 
of 
his 
pretty 
wife. 
He 
turned 
away 
from
her 
with 
a 
grimace 
that<p>
distorted 
his 
handsome 
face, 
kissed 
Anna
Pavlovna's 
hand, 
and 
screwing 
up 
his 
eyes 
scanned 
the 
whole 
company.

"You 
are 
off 
to 
the 
war, 
Prince?" 
said 
Anna 
Pavlovna.

"General 
Kutuzov," 
said 
Bolkonski, 
speaking 
French 
and 
stressing
the 
last 
syllable 
of 
the 
general's 
name 
like 
a 
Frenchman, 
"has 
been
pleased 
to 
take 
me 
<a href="/cZl/Nz6YyaBP3SEu2IoNM.html">as</a> 
an 
aide-de-camp...."

"And 
Lise, 
your 
wife?"

"She 
will 
go 
to 
the 
country."

"Are 
you 
not 
ashamed 
to 
deprive 
us 
of 
your 
charming 
wife?"

"Andre," 
said 
his 
wife, 
addressing 
her 
husband 
in 
the 
same
coquettish 
manner 
in 
which 
she 
spoke 
to 
other 
men, 
"the 
vicomte 
has
been 
telling 
us 
such 
a 
tale 
about 
Mademoiselle 
George 
and 
Buonaparte!"

Prince 
Andrew 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes 
and 
turned 
away. 
Pierre, 
who 
from
the 
moment 
Prince 
Andrew 
entered 
the 
room 
had 
watched 
him 
with 
glad,
affectionate 
eyes, 
now 
came 
up 
and 
took 
his 
arm. 
Before 
he 
looked 
round
Prince 
Andrew 
frowned 
again, 
expressing 
his 
annoyance 
with 
whoever 
was
touching 
his 
arm, 
but 
when 
he 
saw 
Pierre's 
beaming 
face 
he 
gave 
him 
an
unexpectedly 
kind 
and 
pleasant 
smile.

"There 
now!... 
So 
you, 
too, 
are 
in 
the 
great 
world?" 
said 
he 
to
Pierre.

"I 
knew 
you 
would 
be 
here," 
replied 
Pierre. 
"I 
will 
come 
to 
supper
with 
you. 
May 
I?" 
he 
added 
in 
a 
low 
voice 
so 
as 
not 
to 
disturb 
the
vicomte 
who 
was 
continuing 
his 
story.

"No, 
impossible!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
laughing 
and 
pressing
Pierre's 
hand 
to 
show 
that 
there 
was 
no 
need 
to 
ask 
the 
question. 
He
wished

his 
black 
horses 
over 
the 
winter 
rye 
to 
the 
place 
reserved 
for 
him,
where 
a 
wolf 
might 
come 
out. 
Having 
straightened 
his 
coat 
and 
fastened
on 
his 
hunting 
knives 
and 
horn, 
he 
mounted 
his 
good, 
sleek, 
well-fed,
and 
comfortable 
horse, 
Viflyanka, 
which 
was 
turning 
gray, 
like 
himself.
His 
horses 
and 
trap 
were 
sent 
home. 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov, 
though 
not 
at
heart 
a 
keen 
sportsman, 
knew 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
hunt 
well, 
and 
rode 
to
the 
bushy 
edge 
of 
the 
road 
where 
he 
was 
to 
stand, 
arranged 
his 
reins,
settled 
himself 
in 
the 
saddle, 
and, 
feeling 
that 
he 
was 
ready, 
looked
about 
with 
a 
smile.

Beside 
him 
was 
Simon 
Chekmar, 
his 
personal 
attendant, 
an 
old 
horseman
now 
somewhat 
stiff 
in 
the 
saddle. 
Chekmar 
held 
in 
leash 
three
formidable 
wolfhounds, 
who 
had, 
however, 
grown 
fat 
like 
their 
master
and<p>
his 
horse. 
Two 
wise 
old 
dogs 
lay 
down 
unleashed. 
Some 
hundred 
paces
farther 
along 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
wood 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Md6W8CpNdk1.html">stood</a> 
Mitka, 
the 
count's 
other
groom, 
a 
daring 
horseman 
and 
keen 
rider 
to 
hounds. 
Before 
the 
hunt, 
by
old 
custom, 
the 
count 
had 
drunk 
a 
silver 
cupful 
of 
mulled 
brandy, 
taken
a 
snack, 
and 
washed 
it 
down 
with 
half 
a 
bottle 
of 
his 
favorite 
Bordeaux.

He 
was 
somewhat 
flushed 
with 
the 
wine 
and 
the 
drive. 
His 
eyes 
were
rather 
moist 
and 
glittered 
more 
than 
usual, 
and 
as 
he 
sat 
in 
his 
saddle,
wrapped 
up 
in 
his 
fur 
coat, 
he 
looked 
like 
a 
child 
taken 
out 
for 
an
outing.

The 
thin, 
hollow-cheeked 
Chekmar, 
having 
got 
everything 
ready, 
kept
glancing 
at 
his 
master 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
lived 
on 
the 
best 
of 
terms 
for
thirty 
years, 
and 
understanding 
the 
mood 
he 
was 
in 
expected 
a 
pleasant
chat. 
A 
third 
person 
rode 
up 
circumspectly 
through 
the 
wood 
(it 
was
plain 
that 
he 
had 
had 
a 
lesson) 
and 
stopped 
behind 
the 
count. 
This
person 
was 
a 
gray-bearded 
old 
man 
in 
a 
woman's 
cloak, 
with 
a 
tall
peaked 
<a href="/cZl/Xj19Ujvc9DLq.html">cap</a> 
on 
his 
head. 
He 
was 
the 
buffoon, 
who 
went 
by 
a 
woman's
name, 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna.

"Well, 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna!" 
whispered 
the 
count, 
winking 
at 
him.
"If 
you 
scare 
away 
the 
beast, 
Daniel'll 
give 
it 
you!"

"I 
know 
a 
thing 
or 
two 
myself!" 
said 
Nastasya 
Ivanovna.

"Hush!" 
whispered 
the 
count 
and 
turned 
to 
Simon. 
"Have 
you 
seen
the 
young 
countess?" 
he 
asked. 
"Where 
is 
she?"

"With 
young 
Count 
Peter, 
by 
the 
Zharov 
rank 
grass," 
answered 
Simon,
smiling. 
"Though 
she's 
a 
lady, 
she's 
very 
fond 
of 
hunting."

"And 
you're 
surprised 
at 
the 
way 
she 
rides, 
Simon, 
eh?"

Prince 
Andrew, 
having 
reached 
the 
front 
line, 
rode 
along 
it. 
Our 
front
line 
and 
that 
of 
the 
enemy 
were 
far 
apart 
on 
the 
right 
and 
left 
flanks,
but 
in 
the 
center 
where 
the 
men 
with 
a 
flag 
of 
truce 
had 
passed 
that
morning, 
the 
lines 
were 
so 
near 
together 
that 
the 
men 
could 
see 
one
another's 
faces 
and 
speak 
to 
one 
another. 
Besides 
the 
soldiers 
who
formed 
the 
picket 
line 
on 
either 
side, 
there 
were 
many 
curious 
onlookers
who, 
jesting 
and 
laughing, 
stared<p>
at 
their 
strange 
foreign 
enemies.

Since 
early 
morning-despite 
an 
injunction 
not 
to 
approach 
the 
picket
line-the 
officers 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
keep 
sight-seers 
away. 
The
soldiers 
forming 
the 
picket 
line, 
like 
showmen 
exhibiting 
a 
curiosity,
no 
longer 
looked 
at 
the 
French 
but 
paid 
attention 
to 
the 
sight-seers 
and
grew 
weary 
waiting 
to 
be 
relieved. 
Prince 
Andrew 
halted 
to 
have 
a 
look
at 
the 
French.

"Look! 
Look 
there!" 
one 
soldier 
was 
saying 
to 
another, 
pointing 
to 
a
Russian 
musketeer 
who 
had 
gone 
up 
to 
the 
picket 
line 
with 
an 
officer 
and
was 
rapidly 
and 
excitedly 
talking 
to 
a 
French 
grenadier. 
"Hark 
to 
him
jabbering! 
Fine, 
isn't 
it? 
It's 
all 
the 
Frenchy 
can 
do

There 
now, 
Sidorov!"

"Wait 
a 
bit 
and 
listen. 
It's 
fine!" 
answered 
Sidorov, 
who 
was
considered 
an 
adept 
at 
French.

The 
soldier 
to 
whom 
the 
laughers 
referred 
was 
Dolokhov. 
Prince 
Andrew
recognized 
him 
and 
stopped 
to 
listen 
to 
what 
he 
was<p>
saying. 
Dolokhov
had 
come 
from 
the 
left 
flank 
where 
their 
regiment 
was 
stationed, 
with
his 
captain.

"Now 
then, 
go 
on, 
go 
on!" 
incited 
the 
officer, 
bending 
forward 
and
trying 
not 
to 
lose 
a 
word 
of 
the 
speech 
which 
was 
incomprehensible 
to
him. 
"More, 
please: 
more! 
What's 
he 
saying?"

Dolokhov 
did 
not 
answer 
the 
captain; 
he 
had 
been 
drawn 
into 
a 
hot
dispute 
with 
the 
French 
grenadier. 
They 
were 
naturally 
talking 
about 
the
campaign. 
The 
Frenchman, 
confusing 
the 
Austrians 
with 
the 
Russians, 
was
trying 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
Russians 
had 
surrendered 
and 
had 
fled 
all
the 
way 
from 
Ulm, 
while 
Dolokhov 
maintained 
that 
the 
Russians 
had 
not
surrendered 
but 
had 
beaten 
the 
French.

"We 
have 
orders 
to 
drive 
you 
off 
here, 
and 
we 
shall 
drive 
you 
off,"
said 
Dolokhov.

"Only 
take 
care 
you 
and 
your 
Cossacks 
are 
not 
all 
captured!" 
said
the 
French 
grenadier.

The 
French 
onlookers 
and 
listeners 
laughed.

"We'll 
make 
you 
dance 
as 
we 
did 
under 
Suvorov...," 
* 
said
Dolokhov.

 
 
 
 
* 
"On 
vous 
fera 
danser."


"Qu' 
est-ce 
qu'il 
chante?" 
* 
asked 
a 
Frenchman.

 
 
 
 
* 
"What's 
he 
singing 
about?"


"It's 
ancient 
history," 
said 
another, 
guessing 
that 
it 
referred 
<a href="/aVzUge/rw7m8bju5FWU.html">to
a</a> 
former 
war. 
"The 
Emperor<p>
will 
teach 
your 
Suvara 
as 
he 
has 
taught 
the
others..."

"Bonaparte..." 
began 
Dolokhov, 
but 
the 
Frenchman 
interrupted 
him.

"Not 
Bonaparte. 
He 
is 
the 
Emperor! 
Sacre 
nom...!" 
cried 
he 
angrily.

"The 
devil 
skin 
your 
Emperor."

And 
Dolokhov 
swore 
at 
him 
in 
coarse 
soldier's<p>
Russian 
and 
shouldering
his 
musket 
walked 
away.

"Let 
us 
go, 
Ivan 
Lukich," 
he 
said 
to<p>
the 
captain.

"Ah, 
that's 
the 
way 
to 
talk 
French," 
said 
the 
picket 
soldiers.
"Now, 
Sidorov, 
you 
have 
a 
try!"

Sidorov, 
turning 
to 
the 
French, 
winked, 
and 
began 
to 
jabber 
meaningless
sounds 
very 
fast: 
"Kari, 
mala, 
tafa, 
safi, 
muter, 
Kaska," 
he 
said,
trying 
to 
give 
an 
expressive 
intonation 
to 
his 
voice.

"Ho! 
ho! 
ho! 
Ha! 
ha! 
ha! 
ha! 
Ouh! 
ouh!" 
came 
peals 
of 
such 
healthy
and 
good-humored 
laughter 
from 
<a href="/aVzUge/lnA2Q68tvrb.html">the</a>

to

and

as
quickly

But 
the

remained

the

in

looked 
out 
just 
as

Just 
then 
there 
was 
a 
whistle 
in 
the 
air; 
nearer 
and
nearer, 
faster 
and 
louder, 
louder 
and 
faster, 
a 
cannon 
ball, 
as

CHAPTER

Mounting 
his 
horse 
again 
Prince 
Andrew 
lingered 
with 
the 
battery,
looking 
at 
the 
puff 
from 
the 
gun 
that 
had 
sent 
the 
ball. 
His 
eyes
ran 
rapidly 
over 
the 
wide 
space, 
but 
he 
only 
saw 
that 
the 
hitherto
motionless 
masses 
of 
the 
French 
now 
swayed 
and 
that 
there 
really 
was
a 
battery 
to 
their 
left. 
The 
smoke 
above 
it 
had 
not 
yet 
dispersed. 
Two
mounted 
Frenchmen, 
probably 
adjutants, 
were

moving

the

probably 
to 
strengthen

The

Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
back
to 
Grunth 
to 
find 
Prince 
Bagration. 
He 
heard 
the 
cannonade 
behind 
him
growing 
louder 
and 
more 
frequent. 
Evidently 
our 
guns 
had 
begun 
to 
reply.
From 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
slope, 
where 
the 
parleys 
had 
taken 
place, 
came
the 
report 
of 
musketry.

Lemarrois 
had 
just 
arrived 
at 
a 
gallop 
with 
Bonaparte's 
stern 
letter,
and 
Murat, 
humiliated 
and 
anxious 
to 
expiate 
his 
fault, 
had 
at 
once
moved 
his 
forces 
to

said 
Pierre 
to

an

ran 
down 
his

In

in

his
horse 
with 
his 
spurs, 
and 
giving

the<p>

leaped 
lightly 
over. 
Only
a 
little 
earth 
crumbled 
from 
the 
bank 
under 
the 
horse's 
hind 
hoofs.
Turning 
the 
horse 
sharply, 
he 
again 
jumped 
the 
ditch, 
and 
deferentially
addressed 
the 
horseman 
with 
the 
white 
plumes, 
evidently 
suggesting
that 
he 
should 
do 
the 
same. 
The 
rider, 
whose 
figure 
seemed 
familiar
to 
Rostov 
and 
involuntarily 
riveted 
his 
attention, 
made 
a 
gesture 
of
refusal 
with 
his 
head 
and 
hand 
and 
by 
that 
gesture 
Rostov 
instantly
recognized 
his 
lamented 
and 
adored 
monarch.

"But 
it 
can't 
be 
he, 
alone 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
<a href="/cZl/Xo8fnBp1EPTad8Cr.html">this</a> 
empty 
field!"
thought 
Rostov. 
At 
that 
moment 
Alexander 
turned 
his 
head 
and 
Rostov
saw 
the 
beloved 
features 
that 
were 
so 
deeply 
engraved 
on 
his 
memory. 
The
Emperor 
was 
pale, 
his 
cheeks 
sunken 
and 
his 
eyes 
hollow, 
but 
the 
charm,
the 
mildness 
of 
his 
features, 
was 
all 
the 
greater. 
Rostov 
was 
happy
in 
the 
assurance 
that 
the 
rumors 
about 
the 
Emperor 
being 
wounded 
were
false. 
He 
was 
happy 
to 
be 
seeing 
him. 
He 
knew 
that 
he 
might 
and 
even
ought 
to 
go 
straight 
to 
him 
and 
give 
the 
message<p>
Dolgorukov 
had 
ordered
him 
to 
deliver.

But 
as 
a 
youth 
in 
love 
trembles, 
is 
unnerved, 
and 
dares 
not 
utter 
the
thoughts 
he 
has 
dreamed 
of 
for 
nights, 
but 
looks 
around 
for 
help 
or 
a
chance 
of 
delay 
and 
flight 
when 
the 
longed-for 
moment 
comes 
and 
he 
is
alone 
with 
her, 
so 
Rostov, 
now 
that 
he 
had 
attained 
what 
he 
had 
longed
for 
more 
than 
anything 
else 
in 
the 
world, 
did 
not 
know 
how 
to 
approach
the 
Emperor, 
and 
a 
thousand 
reasons 
occurred 
to 
him 
why 
it 
would 
be
inconvenient, 
unseemly, 
and 
impossible 
to 
do 
so.

"What! 
It 
is 
as 
if 
I 
were 
glad 
of 
a 
chance 
to 
take 
advantage 
of
his 
being 
alone 
and 
despondent! 
A 
strange 
face 
may 
seem 
unpleasant 
or
painful 
to 
him 
at 
this 
moment 
of 
sorrow; 
besides, 
what 
can 
I 
say 
to 
him
now, 
when 
my 
heart 
fails 
me 
and 
my 
mouth 
feels 
dry 
at 
the 
mere 
sight
of 
him?" 
Not 
one 
of 
the 
innumerable 
speeches 
addressed 
to 
the 
Emperor
that 
he 
had 
composed 
in 
his 
imagination 
could 
he 
now 
recall. 
Those
speeches 
were 
intended 
for<p>
quite 
other 
conditions, 
they 
were 
for 
the
most 
part 
to 
be 
spoken 
at 
a 
moment 
of 
victory 
and 
triumph, 
generally
when 
he 
was 
dying 
of 
wounds 
and 
the 
sovereign 
had 
thanked 
him 
for 
heroic
deeds, 
and 
while 
dying 
he 
expressed 
the 
love 
his 
actions 
had 
proved.

"Besides 
how 
can 
I 
ask 
the 
Emperor 
for 
his 
instructions 
for 
the 
right
flank 
now 
that 
it 
is 
nearly 
four 
o'clock 
and 
the 
battle 
is 
lost?
No, 
certainly 
I 
must 
not 
approach 
him, 
I 
must 
not 
intrude 
on 
his
reflections. 
Better 
die<p>
a 
thousand 
times 
than 
risk 
receiving 
an 
unkind
look 
or 
bad 
opinion 
from 
him," 
Rostov 
decided; 
and 
sorrowfully 
and
with 
a 
heart 
full 
despair 
he 
rode 
away, 
continually 
looking 
back 
at 
the
Tsar, 
who 
still 
remained 
in 
the 
same 
attitude 
of 
indecision.

While 
Rostov 
was 
thus 
arguing 
with 
himself 
and 
riding 
sadly 
away,
Captain 
von 
Toll 
chanced 
to 
ride 
to 
the 
same 
spot, 
and 
seeing 
the
Emperor 
at 
once 
rode 
up 
to 
him, 
offered 
his 
services, 
and 
assisted 
him
to 
cross 
the 
ditch 
on 
foot. 
The 
Emperor, 
wishing 
to 
rest 
and 
feeling
unwell, 
sat 
down 
under 
an 
apple 
tree 
and 
von 
Toll 
remained 
beside 
him.
Rostov 
from 
a 
distance 
saw 
with 
envy 
and 
remorse 
how 
von 
Toll 
spoke
long 
and 
warmly 
to 
the 
Emperor 
and 
how 
the 
Emperor, 
evidently 
weeping,
covered 
his 
eyes 
with 
his 
hand 
and 
pressed 
von 
Toll's 
hand.

"And 
I 
might 
have 
been 
in 
his 
place!" 
thought 
Rostov, 
and 
hardly
restraining 
his 
tears 
of 
pity 
for 
the 
Emperor, 
he 
rode 
on 
in 
utter
despair, 
not 
knowing 
where 
to 
or 
why 
he 
was 
now 
riding.

Nicholas.

He

he

so

He
never

He 
knew 
that 
his
every 
decision 
would 
be 
approved 
by 
them 
all 
with 
very 
few 
exceptions.

He

on 
or 
punish 
a

to

merely

he 
felt

but 
the 
standard 
was 
quite 
firm 
and 
definite 
in
his 
own 
mind.

Often,

with 
vexation

he 
would

XIII

That

night, 
having 
taken 
leave 
of 
the 
Minister 
of 
War, 
Bolkonski
set 
off 
to 
rejoin 
the 
army, 
not 
knowing 
where 
he 
would 
find

and
fearing 
to 
be 
captured 
by 
the 
French 
on 
the 
way 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Vd4GdRBS0DduKC9cLqy.html">to</a> 
Krems.

In 
Bruenn 
everybody 
attached 
to 
the 
court 
was 
packing 
up, 
and 
the 
heavy
baggage 
was 
already 
being 
dispatched 
to 
Olmuetz. 
Near 
Hetzelsdorf 
Prince
Andrew 
struck 
the 
high 
road 
along 
which 
the 
Russian 
army 
was 
moving 
with
great 
haste 
and 
in 
the 
greatest 
disorder. 
The 
road 
was 
so 
obstructed
with 
carts 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
get 
by 
in 
a 
carriage. 
Prince 
Andrew
took 
a 
horse 
and 
a 
Cossack 
from 
a 
Cossack<p>
commander, 
and 
hungry 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">and
weary,</a> 
making 
his 
way 
past 
the 
baggage 
wagons, 
rode 
in 
search 
of 
the
commander 
in 
chief 
and 
of 
his 
own 
luggage. 
Very 
sinister<p>
reports 
of 
the
position<p>
of 
the 
army 
reached 
him 
as 
he 
went 
along, 
and 
the 
appearance 
of
the 
troops 
in 
their 
disorderly 
flight 
confirmed 
these 
rumors.

not

It

long

listening 
to 
his

He
laughed 
blandly 
at 
her 
naive 
diplomacy 
but 
listened 
to 
what 
she 
had
to 
say, 
and 
sometimes 
questioned 
her 
carefully 
about 
the 
Penza 
and
Nizhegorod 
estates.

Julie 
had 
long 
been 
expecting 
<a href="/cZl/qj9eXK5ZNkA6pXQvm.html">a</a> 
proposal 
from 
her 
melancholy 
adorer 
and
was 
ready 
to 
accept 
it; 
but 
some 
secret 
feeling 
of 
repulsion 
for 
her,
for 
her 
passionate 
desire 
to 
get 
married, 
<a href="/cZl/Pw2SDFV7U1wKMFq.html">for</a><p>
her 
artificiality, 
and
a 
feeling 
of 
horror 
at 
renouncing 
the 
possibility 
of 
real 
love 
still
restrained 
Boris. 
His 
leave 
was 
expiring. 
He 
spent 
every 
day 
and 
whole
days 
at 
the 
Karagins', 
and 
every 
day 
on 
thinking 
the 
matter 
over
told 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
propose 
tomorrow. 
But 
in 
Julie's 
presence,
looking 
at 
her 
red 
face 
and 
chin 
(nearly 
always 
powdered), 
her 
moist
eyes, 
and 
her 
expression 
of 
continual 
readiness 
to 
pass 
at 
once 
from
melancholy 
to 
an 
unnatural 
rapture 
of 
married 
bliss, 
Boris 
could 
not
utter 
the 
decisive 
words, 
though 
in 
imagination 
he 
had 
long 
regarded
himself 
as 
the 
possessor 
of 
those 
Penza 
and 
Nizhegorod 
estates 
and
had 
apportioned 
the 
use 
of 
the 
income 
from 
them. 
Julie 
saw 
Boris'
indecision, 
and 
sometimes 
the 
thought 
occurred 
to 
her 
that 
she 
was
repulsive 
to 
him, 
but 
her 
feminine 
self-deception 
immediately 
supplied
her 
with 
consolation, 
and 
she 
told 
herself 
that 
he 
was 
only 
shy 
from
love. 
Her 
melancholy, 
however, 
began 
to 
turn 
to 
irritability, 
and 
not
long 
before 
Boris' 
departure 
she 
formed 
a 
definite 
plan 
of 
action.
Just 
as 
Boris' 
leave 
of 
absence 
was 
expiring, 
Anatole 
Kuragin 
made
his 
appearance 
in 
Moscow, 
and 
of 
course 
in 
the 
Karagins' 
drawing
room, 
and 
Julie, 
suddenly 
abandoning 
her 
melancholy, 
became 
cheerful 
and
very 
attentive 
to 
Kuragin.

"My 
dear," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
to 
her 
son, 
"I 
know 
from 
a
reliable 
source 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
has 
sent 
his 
son 
to 
Moscow 
to 
get
him 
married 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EJ8iU0FKLE4bmpaY.html">to</a> 
Julie. 
I 
am 
so 
fond 
of 
Julie 
that 
I 
should 
be 
sorry 
for
her. 
What 
do 
you 
think 
of 
it, 
my 
dear?"

The 
idea 
of 
being 
made 
a 
fool 
of 
and 
of 
having 
thrown 
away 
that 
whole
month 
of 
arduous 
melancholy 
service 
to 
Julie, 
and 
of 
seeing 
all
the 
revenue 
from 
the 
Penza 
estates 
which 
he 
had 
already 
mentally
apportioned 
and 
put 
to 
proper 
use 
fall 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
another, 
and
especially 
into 
the 
hands 
of 
that 
idiot 
Anatole, 
pained 
Boris. 
He 
drove
to 
the 
Karagins' 
with 
the 
firm 
intention 
of 
proposing. 
Julie 
met
him 
in 
a 
gay, 
careless 
manner, 
spoke 
casually 
of 
how 
she 
had 
enjoyed
yesterday's 
ball, 
and 
asked 
when 
he 
was 
leaving. 
Though 
Boris 
had
come 
intentionally 
to 
speak 
of 
his 
love 
and 
therefore 
meant 
to 
be
tender, 
he 
began 
speaking 
irritably 
of 
feminine 
inconstancy, 
of 
how
easily 
women 
can 
turn 
from 
sadness 
to 
joy, 
and 
how 
their 
moods 
depend
solely 
on 
who 
happens 
to 
be 
paying 
court 
to 
them. 
Julie 
was 
offended 
and
replied 
that 
it 
was 
true 
that 
a 
woman 
needs 
variety, 
and 
the 
same 
thing
over 
and 
over 
again 
would 
weary 
anyone.

"Then 
I 
should 
advise 
you..." 
Boris 
began, 
wishing 
to 
sting 
her;
but 
<a href="/cZl/Gs8dBoY0tjjJI2.html">at</a> 
that 
instant 
the 
galling 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him 
that 
he 
might
have 
to 
leave 
Moscow 
without 
having 
accomplished 
his 
aim, 
and 
have
vainly 
wasted 
his 
efforts-which 
was 
a 
thing 
he 
never 
allowed 
to
happen.

He 
checked 
himself 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
sentence, 
lowered 
his 
eyes 
to
avoid 
seeing 
her 
unpleasantly 
irritated 
and 
irresolute 
face, 
and 
said:

"I 
did 
not 
come 
here 
at 
all 
to 
quarrel 
with 
you. 
On 
the 
contrary..."

He 
glanced 
at 
her 
to 
make<p>
sure 
that 
he 
might 
go 
on.<p>
Her 
irritability 
had
suddenly 
<a href="/cZl/CS7GLq8IDLzm4oOe.html">quite</a> 
vanished, 
and 
her 
anxious, 
imploring 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
on
him 
with 
greedy 
expectation. 
"I 
can 
always 
arrange 
so 
as 
not 
to 
see
her 
often," 
thought 
Boris. 
"The 
affair 
has 
been

must 
be
finished!" 
He 
blushed 
hotly, 
raised 
his 
eyes

"All

at

He

Her 
face 
flushed.

"Oh, 
take

off...

she 
said,<p>

to 
his
spectacles.

Pierre 
took

off, 
and 
his 
eyes,

the 
strange 
look 
eyes 
have
from 
which 
spectacles 
have 
just

had 
also

was 
about 
to 
stoop 
over 
her 
hand 
and 
kiss 
it, 
but
with 
a 
rapid, 
almost 
brutal 
movement 
of 
her 
head, 
she 
intercepted 
his
lips 
and 
met 
them 
with 
her 
own. 
Her 
face 
struck 
Pierre, 
by 
its 
altered,
unpleasantly 
excited 
expression.

"It 
is 
too 
late 
now, 
it's 
done;

I

"I

Six 
weeks

CHAPTER 
III

Old 
Prince 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Prince 
Vasili
in 
November, 
1805, 
announcing 
that 
he 
and 
his 
son 
would 
be 
paying 
him
a 
visit. 
"I 
am 
starting 
on 
a 
journey 
of 
inspection, 
and 
of 
course 
I
shall 
think 
nothing 
of 
an 
extra 
seventy 
miles 
to 
come 
and 
see 
you 
at
the 
same 
time, 
my 
honored 
benefactor," 
wrote 
Prince 
Vasili. 
"My 
son
Anatole 
is 
accompanying 
me 
on 
his 
way 
to 
the 
army, 
so 
I 
hope 
you 
will
allow 
him 
personally 
to 
express 
the 
deep 
respect 
that, 
emulating 
his
father, 
he 
feels 
for 
you."

"It 
seems 
that 
there 
will 
be 
no 
need 
to 
bring 
Mary 
out, 
suitors 
are
coming 
to 
us 
of 
their 
own 
accord," 
incautiously 
remarked 
the 
little
princess 
on 
hearing 
the 
news.

Prince 
Nicholas 
frowned, 
but 
said 
nothing.

A 
fortnight 
after 
the 
letter 
Prince 
Vasili's 
servants 
came 
one
evening 
in 
advance 
of 
him, 
and 
he 
and 
his 
son 
arrived 
next 
day.

Old 
Bolkonski 
had 
always 
had 
a 
poor 
opinion 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's
character, 
but 
more 
so 
recently, 
since 
in 
the 
new 
reigns 
of 
Paul 
and
Alexander 
Prince 
Vasili 
had 
risen 
to 
high<p>
position 
and 
honors. 
And 
now,
from 
the 
hints 
contained 
in 
his 
letter 
and 
given 
by 
the 
little 
princess,
he 
saw 
which 
way 
the 
wind 
was 
blowing, 
and 
his 
low 
opinion 
changed 
into
a 
feeling 
of 
contemptuous 
ill 
will. 
He 
snorted 
whenever 
he 
mentioned
him. 
On 
the 
day 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's 
arrival, 
Prince 
Bolkonski 
was
particularly 
discontented 
and 
out 
of 
temper. 
Whether 
he 
was 
in 
a 
bad
temper 
because 
Prince 
Vasili 
was 
coming, 
or 
whether 
his 
being 
in 
a 
bad
temper<p>
made 
him 
specially 
annoyed 
at 
Prince 
Vasili's 
visit, 
he 
was
in 
a 
bad 
temper, 
and 
in 
the 
morning 
Tikhon 
had 
already 
advised 
the
architect 
not 
to 
go 
to 
the<p>
prince 
with 
his 
report.

"Do 
you 
hear 
how 
he's 
walking?" 
said 
Tikhon, 
drawing 
the
architect's 
attention 
to 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
prince's 
footsteps.
"Stepping 
flat 
on 
his 
heels-we 
know 
what 
that 
means...."

However, 
at 
nine 
o'clock 
the 
prince, 
in 
his 
velvet 
coat 
with 
a 
sable
collar 
and 
cap, 
went 
out 
for 
his 
usual 
walk. 
It 
had 
snowed 
the 
day
before 
and

his 
efforts 
that 
the 
whole 
population 
under 
his 
rule 
is
kept 
going, 
and 
in 
this 
consciousness 
of 
being 
indispensable 
every
administrator 
finds 
the 
chief 
reward 
of 
his 
labor 
and 
efforts. 
While 
the
sea 
of 
history 
remains 
calm 
the 
ruler-administrator 
in 
his 
frail 
bark,
holding 
on 
with 
a 
boat 
hook 
to 
the 
ship 
of 
the 
people 
and 
himself
moving, 
naturally 
imagines 
that 
his 
efforts 
move 
the 
ship 
he 
is 
holding
on 
to. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
a 
storm 
arises 
and 
the 
sea 
begins 
to 
heave 
and
the 
ship 
to 
move, 
such 
a 
delusion 
is 
no 
longer 
possible. 
The 
ship 
moves
independently 
with 
its 
own 
enormous 
motion, 
the 
boat 
hook 
no 
longer
reaches 
the 
moving 
vessel, 
and 
suddenly 
the 
administrator, 
instead
of 
appearing 
a 
ruler 
and 
a 
source 
of 
power, 
becomes 
an 
insignificant,
useless, 
feeble 
man.

Rostopchin 
felt 
this, 
and 
it 
was 
this 
which 
exasperated 
him.

This</h1>battle, 
which 
consisted 
in<p>
the 
capture 
of 
a 
French 
squadron, 
was
represented 
as 
a 
brilliant 
victory 
over 
the 
French, 
and 
so 
the
Emperor 
and 
the 
whole 
army, 
especially 
while 
the 
smoke 
hung 
over
the 
battlefield, 
believed 
that 
the 
French 
had 
been 
defeated 
and 
were
retreating 
against 
their 
will. 
A 
few 
minutes 
after 
the 
Emperor 
had
passed, 
the 
Pavlograd 
division 
was 
ordered 
to 
advance. 
In 
Wischau
itself, 
a 
petty 
German 
town, 
Rostov 
saw 
the 
Emperor 
again. 
In 
the
market 
place, 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gd2ioN4Kzb7qLBzM.html">where</a> 
there 
had 
been 
some 
rather 
heavy 
firing 
before 
the
Emperor's 
arrival, 
lay 
several 
killed 
and 
wounded 
soldiers 
whom 
there
had<p>
not 
been 
time 
to 
move. 
The 
Emperor, 
surrounded 
by 
his 
suite
of 
officers 
and 
courtiers, 
was 
riding 
a 
bobtailed 
chestnut 
mare, 
a
different 
one 
from 
that 
which 
he 
had 
ridden 
at 
the 
review, 
and 
bending
to 
one 
side 
he 
gracefully 
held 
a 
gold 
lorgnette 
to 
his 
eyes 
and 
looked
at 
a 
soldier 
who 
lay 
prone, 
with 
blood 
on 
his 
uncovered 
head. 
The
wounded 
soldier 
was 
so 
dirty, 
coarse, 
and 
revolting 
that 
his 
proximity
to 
the 
Emperor 
shocked 
Rostov. 
Rostov 
saw 
how 
the 
Emperor's 
rather
round 
shoulders 
shuddered 
as 
if 
a 
cold 
shiver 
had 
run 
down 
them, 
how 
his
left 
foot 
began 
convulsively 
tapping 
the 
horse's 
side 
with 
the 
spur,
and 
how 
the 
well-trained 
horse 
looked 
round 
unconcerned 
and 
did 
not
stir. 
An 
adjutant, 
dismounting, 
lifted 
the 
soldier 
under 
the 
arms 
to
place 
him 
on 
a 
stretcher 
that 
had 
been 
brought. 
The 
soldier 
groaned.

"Gently, 
gently! 
Can't<p>
you 
do 
it 
more 
gently?" 
said 
the 
Emperor
apparently 
suffering 
more 
than 
the 
dying 
soldier, 
and 
he 
rode 
away.

Rostov 
saw 
tears 
filling 
the 
Emperor's 
eyes 
and 
heard 
him, 
as 
he 
was
riding 
away, 
say 
to 
Czartoryski: 
"What 
a 
terrible 
thing 
war 
is: 
what
a 
terrible 
thing! 
Quelle 
terrible 
chose 
que 
la 
guerre!"

The 
troops 
of 
the 
vanguard 
were 
stationed 
before 
Wischau, 
within 
sight
of 
the 
enemy's 
lines, 
which 
all 
day 
long 
had 
yielded 
ground 
to 
us
at 
the 
least 
firing. 
The 
Emperor's 
gratitude 
was 
announced 
to 
the
vanguard, 
rewards 
were 
promised, 
and 
the 
men 
received 
a 
double 
ration 
of
vodka. 
The 
campfires 
crackled 
and 
the 
soldiers' 
songs 
resounded
even 
more 
merrily 
than 
on 
the 
previous 
night. 
Denisov 
celebrated 
his
promotion 
to 
the 
rank 
of 
major, 
and 
Rostov, 
who 
had 
already 
drunk
enough, 
at 
the 
end 
of 
the 
feast 
proposed 
the 
Emperor's 
health. 
"Not
'our 
Sovereign, 
the 
Emperor,' 
as 
they 
say 
at 
official 
dinners,"
said 
he, 
"but 
the

good, 
enchanting,

Let

"If

gave 
them 
<a href="/aVzUge/EY78hoZsa0.html">his</a> 
final
conclusions 
in 
the 
form 
of 
commands. 
Having 
listened 
to 
a 
suggestion
from 
Davout, 
who 
was 
now 
called 
Prince 
d'Eckmuehl, 
to 
turn 
the 
Russian
left 
wing, 
Napoleon 
said 
it 
should 
not 
be 
done, 
without 
explaining
why 
not. 
To 
a 
proposal 
made 
by 
General 
Campan 
(who 
was 
to 
attack 
<a href="/cZl/ml75ReoD3VEt.html">the
fleches)</a> 
to 
lead 
his 
division 
through 
the 
woods, 
Napoleon 
agreed, 
though
the 
so-called 
Duke 
of 
Elchingen 
(Ney) 
ventured 
to 
remark 
that 
a 
movement
through 
the 
woods 
was 
dangerous 
and 
might 
disorder 
the 
division.

Having 
inspected 
the 
country 
opposite 
the 
Shevardino 
Redoubt, 
Napoleon
pondered 
a 
little 
in 
silence 
and 
then 
indicated 
the 
spots 
where 
two
batteries 
should 
be 
set 
up 
by 
the 
morrow 
to 
act 
against 
the 
Russian
entrenchments, 
and 
the 
places 
where, 
in 
line 
with 
them, 
the 
field
artillery 
should 
be 
placed.

After 
giving 
these 
and 
other 
commands 
he 
returned 
to 
his 
tent, 
and 
the
dispositions 
for 
the

These

"Don't!<p>
Don't!

whispered 
their 
frightened
voices.

Dolokhov 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
clear, 
mirthful, 
cruel 
eyes, 
and 
that
smile 
of 
his 
which 
seemed 
to 
say, 
"Ah! 
This 
is 
what 
I 
like!"

"You 
shan't

he 
said 
distinctly.

Pale, 
with 
quivering 
lips, 
Pierre 
snatched 
the 
copy.

"You...! 
you... 
scoundrel! 
I 
challenge 
you!" 
he<p>
ejaculated, 
and,
pushing 
back 
his 
chair, 
he 
rose 
from 
the 
table.

At 
the 
very 
instant 
he 
did 
this 
and 
uttered 
those 
words, 
Pierre 
felt
that 
the 
question 
of 
his 
wife's 
guilt 
which 
had 
been 
tormenting 
him
the 
whole 
day 
was 
finally 
and 
indubitably 
answered 
in 
the<p>
affirmative.
He 
hated 
her 
and 
was 
forever 
sundered 
from 
her. 
Despite 
Denisov's
request 
that 
he 
would 
take 
no 
part 
in 
the 
matter, 
Rostov 
agreed 
to 
be
Dolokhov's 
second, 
and 
after 
dinner 
he 
discussed<p>
the 
arrangements 
for
the 
duel 
with 
Nesvitski, 
Bezukhov's 
second. 
Pierre 
went 
home, 
but
Rostov 
with 
Dolokhov 
and 
Denisov 
stayed 
on 
at 
the 
club<p>
till 
late,
listening 
to 
the 
gypsies 
and 
other 
singers.

"Well 
then, 
till 
tomorrow 
at 
Sokolniki," 
said 
Dolokhov, 
as 
he<p>
took
leave 
of 
Rostov 
in 
the 
club 
porch.

"And 
do 
you 
feel 
quite 
calm?" 
Rostov 
asked.

Dolokhov 
<a href="/cZl/nr9b2U5YysHj.html">paused.

"Well,</a> 
you 
see, 
I'll 
tell 
you 
the 
whole 
secret 
of 
dueling 
in 
two
words. 
If 
you 
are 
going 
to 
fight 
a 
duel, 
and 
you 
make 
a 
will 
and 
write
affectionate

your

if 
you 
think 
you 
may 
be
killed, 
you 
are 
a

But 
go 
with 
the

then 
all 
will 
be 
right, 
as 
our 
bear 
huntsman 
at 
Kostroma

to 
tell

'Everyone

Till 
tomorrow, 
my 
dear 
fellow.

Next 
day, 
at 
eight 
in 
the 
morning, 
Pierre 
and 
Nesvitski 
drove 
to 
the
Sokolniki 
forest 
and 
found 
Dolokhov, 
Denisov, 
and 
Rostov 
already
there. 
Pierre 
had 
the 
air 
of 
a 
man 
preoccupied 
with 
considerations 
which
had 
no 
connection 
with 
the 
matter 
in 
hand. 
His 
haggard 
face 
was 
yellow.
He 
had 
evidently 
not 
slept 
that 
night. 
He 
looked 
about 
distractedly 
and
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes 
as 
if 
dazzled 
by 
the 
sun. 
He 
was 
entirely 
absorbed
by 
two 
considerations: 
his 
wife's 
guilt, 
of 
which 
after 
his 
sleepless
night 
he 
had 
not 
the 
slightest 
doubt, 
and 
the 
guiltlessness 
of
Dolokhov, 
who 
had 
no 
reason 
to 
preserve 
the 
honor 
of 
a 
man 
who 
was
nothing 
to 
him.... 
"I 
should 
perhaps 
have 
done 
the 
same 
thing 
in 
his
place," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"It's 
even<p>
certain 
that 
I 
should 
have 
done
the 
same, 
then 
why 
this 
duel, 
this 
murder? 
Either 
I 
shall 
kill 
him, 
or
he 
will 
hit 
me 
in 
the 
head, 
or 
elbow, 
or 
knee. 
Can't 
I 
go 
away 
from
here, 
run 
away, 
bury 
myself 
somewhere?" 
passed 
through 
his 
mind. 
But
just 
at 
moments 
when 
such 
thoughts 
occurred 
to 
him, 
he 
would 
ask 
in 
a
particularly 
calm 
and 
absent-minded 
way, 
which 
inspired 
the 
respect 
of
the 
onlookers, 
"Will 
it 
be 
long? 
Are 
things 
ready?"

When 
all 
was 
ready, 
the 
sabers 
stuck 
in 
the 
snow 
to 
mark 
the 
barriers,
and 
the 
pistols 
loaded, 
Nesvitski 
went 
up 
to 
Pierre.

"I 
should 
not 
be 
doing 
my 
duty, 
Count," 
he 
said 
in 
timid 
tones,
"and 
should 
not 
justify 
your 
confidence 
and 
the 
honor 
you 
have 
done
me 
in 
choosing 
me 
for 
your 
second, 
if 
at 
this 
grave, 
this 
very
grave, 
moment 
I 
did 
not 
tell 
you 
the 
whole 
truth. 
I 
think 
there 
is 
no
sufficient 
ground 
for 
this 
affair, 
or 
for 
blood 
to 
be 
shed 
over 
it....
You

quite 
in 
the 
right,

Bogdanich

up

he

After

dismissal

Zherkov

he
could

and 
had 
succeeded

himself

Bagration. 
He 
now
came 
to 
his 
former 
chief 
with 
an 
order 
from 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
rear
guard.

"Colonel," 
he 
said, 
addressing 
Rostov's 
enemy 
with 
an 
air 
of
gloomy 
gravity 
and 
glancing 
round 
at 
his 
comrades, 
"there

"An

asked 
the

morosely.

"I

the

return

bridge.'"

Zherkov 
was 
followed 
by 
an 
officer 
of 
the 
suite 
who 
rode 
up 
to 
the
colonel 
of 
hussars 
with 
the 
same 
order. 
After 
him 
the 
stout 
Nesvitski
came 
galloping 
up 
on 
a 
Cossack 
horse 
that 
could 
scarcely 
carry 
his
weight.

"How's 
this, 
Colonel?" 
he 
shouted 
as 
he 
approached. 
"I 
told 
you
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
and 
now 
someone 
has 
gone 
and 
blundered; 
they 
are 
all
beside 
themselves 
over 
there 
and 
one 
can't 
make 
anything 
out."

The 
colonel 
deliberately 
stopped 
the 
regiment 
and 
turned 
to 
Nesvitski.

"You 
spoke 
to 
me 
of 
inflammable 
material," 
said 
he, 
"but 
you 
said
nothing 
about 
firing 
it."

"But, 
my 
dear 
sir," 
said 
Nesvitski 
as 
he 
drew 
up, 
taking 
off 
his
cap 
and 
smoothing 
his 
hair 
wet 
with 
perspiration 
with 
his 
plump 
hand,
"wasn't 
I 
telling 
you 
to 
fire 
the 
bridge, 
when 
inflammable 
material
had 
been 
put 
in 
position?"

"I 
am 
not 
your 
'dear 
sir,' 
Mr. 
Staff 
Officer, 
and 
you 
did 
not 
tell
me 
to 
burn 
the 
bridge! 
I 
know 
the 
service, 
and 
it 
is 
my 
habit 
orders
strictly 
to 
obey. 
You 
said 
the 
bridge 
would 
be 
burned, 
but 
who 
would
burn 
it, 
I 
could 
not 
know 
by 
the 
holy 
spirit!"

"Ah, 
that's 
always 
the 
way!" 
said 
Nesvitski 
with 
a 
wave 
of 
the
hand. 
"How 
did 
you 
get 
here?" 
said 
he, 
turning 
to 
Zherkov.

"On 
the 
same 
business. 
But 
you 
are 
damp! 
Let 
me 
wring 
you 
out!"

"You 
were 
saying, 
Mr. 
Staff 
Officer..." 
continued 
the 
colonel 
in 
an
offended 
tone.

"Colonel," 
interrupted 
the 
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
"You 
must 
be
quick 
or 
the 
enemy 
will 
bring 
up 
his 
guns 
to 
use 
grapeshot."

The 
colonel 
looked 
silently 
at 
the 
officer 
of 
the 
suite, 
at 
the 
stout
staff 
officer, 
and 
at 
Zherkov, 
and 
he 
frowned.

"I 
will 
the 
bridge 
fire," 
he 
said 
in 
a 
solemn 
tone 
as 
if 
to<p>
announce
that 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
the 
unpleasantness 
he 
had 
to 
endure 
he 
would 
still
do 
the 
right 
thing.

Striking 
his 
horse 
with 
his 
long 
muscular 
legs 
as 
if 
it 
were 
to 
blame
for 
everything, 
the 
colonel 
moved 
forward 
and 
ordered 
the 
second
squadron, 
that 
in 
which 
Rostov 
was 
serving 
under 
Denisov, 
to 
return 
to
the 
bridge.

"There, 
it's 
just 
as 
I 
thought," 
said 
Rostov 
to 
himself. 
"He
wishes 
to 
test 
me!" 
His 
heart 
contracted 
and 
the 
blood 
rushed 
to 
his
face. 
"Let 
him 
see 
whether 
I 
am 
a 
coward!" 
he 
thought.

Again 
on 
all 
the 
bright 
faces 
of 
the 
squadron 
the 
serious 
expression
appeared 
that 
they 
had 
worn 
when 
under 
fire. 
Rostov 
watched 
his 
enemy,
the 
colonel, 
closely-to 
find 
in 
his 
face 
confirmation 
of 
his 
own
conjecture, 
but 
the 
colonel 
did 
not 
once 
glance 
at 
Rostov, 
and 
looked

Hardly 
had 
he 
got 
rid 
of 
his 
hat 
before 
he 
ran 
into 
Prince
Andrew's 
room 
with 
a 
preoccupied 
air 
and 
at 
once 
began 
talking. 
He
had 
just<p>
heard 
particulars 
of 
that 
morning's 
sitting 
of 
the 
Council
of<p>
State 
opened 
by 
the 
Emperor, 
and 
he 
spoke 
of 
it 
enthusiastically. 
The
Emperor's 
speech 
had 
been 
extraordinary. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
speech 
such 
as
only 
constitutional 
monarchs 
deliver. 
"The 
Sovereign 
plainly 
said
that 
the 
Council 
and 
Senate 
are 
estates 
of 
the 
realm, 
he 
said 
that 
the
government 
must 
rest 
not 
on 
authority 
but 
on 
secure 
bases. 
The 
Emperor
said 
that 
the 
fiscal 
<a href="/aVzUge/mK9b97YIp.html">system</a> 
must 
be 
reorganized 
and 
the 
accounts
published," 
recounted 
Bitski, 
emphasizing 
certain 
words 
and 
opening
his 
eyes 
significantly.

"Ah, 
yes! 
Today's 
events 
mark 
an 
epoch, 
the 
greatest 
epoch 
in 
our
history," 
he 
concluded.

Prince 
Andrew 
listened 
to 
the 
account 
of 
the<p>
opening 
of 
the 
Council 
of
State, 
which 
he 
had 
so 
impatiently 
awaited 
and 
to 
which 
he 
had 
attached
such 
importance, 
and 
was 
surprised 
that 
this 
event, 
now 
that 
it 
had
taken 
place, 
did 
not 
affect 
him, 
and 
even 
seemed 
quite 
insignificant. 
He
listened 
with 
quiet 
irony 
to 
Bitski's 
enthusiastic 
account 
of 
it. 
A
very 
simple 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him: 
"What 
does 
it 
matter 
to 
me 
or 
to
Bitski 
what 
the 
Emperor 
was 
pleased 
to 
say 
at 
the 
Council? 
Can 
all 
that
make 
me 
any 
happier 
or 
better?"

And 
this 
simple 
reflection 
suddenly 
destroyed 
all 
the 
interest 
Prince
Andrew 
had 
felt 
in 
the 
impending 
reforms. 
He 
was 
going 
to 
dine 
that
evening 
at 
Speranski's, 
"with 
only 
a 
few 
friends," 
as 
the 
host
had 
said 
when 
inviting 
him. 
The 
prospect 
of 
that 
dinner 
in 
the 
intimate
home 
circle 
of 
the 
man 
he 
so 
admired 
had 
greatly 
interested 
Prince
Andrew, 
especially 
as 
he 
had 
not 
yet 
seen 
Speranski 
in 
his 
domestic
surroundings, 
<a href="/aVzUge/WI3bju49I.html">but</a> 
now 
he 
felt 
disinclined 
to 
go 
to 
it.

At 
the 
appointed 
hour, 
however, 
he 
entered 
the 
modest 
house 
Speranski
owned 
in 
the 
Taurida 
Gardens. 
In 
the 
parqueted 
dining 
room 
of 
this 
small
house, 
remarkable 
for 
its 
extreme 
cleanliness 
(suggesting 
that 
of 
a
monastery), 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
was 
rather 
late, 
found 
the 
friendly
gathering 
of 
Speranski's 
intimate 
acquaintances 
already 
assembled
at 
five 
o'clock. 
There 
were 
no 
ladies 
present 
except 
Speranski's
little 
daughter 
(long-faced 
like 
her 
father) 
and 
her 
governess. 
The
other 
guests 
were 
Gervais, 
Magnitski, 
and 
Stolypin. 
While 
still 
in
the 
anteroom 
Prince 
Andrew 
heard 
loud 
voices 
and 
a 
ringing 
staccato
laugh-a 
laugh 
such 
as 
one 
hears 
on 
the 
stage. 
Someone-it 
sounded
like 
Speranski-was 
distinctly 
ejaculating 
ha-ha-ha. 
Prince 
Andrew
had 
never 
before 
heard 
Speranski's 
famous 
laugh, 
and 
this 
ringing,
high-pitched 
laughter 
from 
a 
statesman 
made 
a 
strange 
impression 
on 
him.

He 
entered 
the 
dining 
room. 
The 
whole 
company 
were 
standing 
between 
two
windows 
at 
a 
small 
table 
laid 
with 
hors-d'oeuvres. 
Speranski, 
wearing
a 
gray 
swallow-tail 
coat 
with 
a 
star 
on 
the 
breast, 
and 
evidently 
still
the 
same 
waistcoat 
and 
high 
white 
stock 
he 
had 
worn 
at 
the 
meeting 
of
the 
Council 
of 
State, 
stood 
at 
the 
table 
with 
<a href="/cZl/WI7DaWbR2p3Ro.html">a</a> 
beaming 
countenance. 
His
guests 
surrounded 
him. 
Magnitski, 
addressing 
himself 
to 
Speranski,
was 
relating 
an 
anecdote, 
and 
Speranski 
was 
laughing 
in 
advance 
at
what 
Magnitski 
was 
going 
to 
say. 
When 
Prince 
Andrew 
entered 
the 
room
Magnitski's 
words 
were 
again 
crowned 
by 
laughter. 
Stolypin 
gave
a 
deep 
bass 
guffaw<p>
as 
he 
munched 
a 
piece 
of 
bread 
and 
cheese. 
Gervais
laughed 
softly 
with 
a<p>
hissing 
chuckle, 
and 
Speranski 
in 
a 
high-pitched
staccato 
manner.

Still 
laughing, 
Speranski 
<a href="/aVzUge/WI3bju49I.html">held</a> 
out 
his 
soft 
white 
hand

the

his 
people-strengthened 
this
idea.

The

evoking 
enthusiasm,

all

about

Count 
Ilya 
Rostov,

Catherine's

was 
sauntering 
with 
a

with 
all 
of

he

He

smile 
and 
nods 
of 
approval, 
as 
he

The

from

by 
his

His

was 
fresh 
and 
rosy, 
his 
white-plumed 
hat,
tilted 
to 
one 
side, 
disclosed 
his 
curled

hair 
besprinkled
with

"Yes, 
indeed, 
that's 
a 
true 
sage," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"He 
sees 
nothing
beyond 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the

nothing 
troubles 
him<p>
and 
so 
he

satisfied, 
and 
serene. 
What 
wouldn't<p>
I

he 
thought 
enviously.

In 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's 
anteroom 
the 
footman 
who 
helped 
him 
off 
with 
his
fur 
coat 
said 
that 
the 
mistress 
asked 
him 
to 
come 
to 
her 
bedroom.

When 
he 
opened 
the 
ballroom 
door 
Pierre 
saw 
Natasha 
sitting 
at 
the
window, 
with 
a 
thin, 
pale, 
and 
spiteful 
face. 
She 
glanced 
round 
at 
him,
frowned, 
and 
left 
the 
room 
with 
an 
expression 
of 
cold 
dignity.

"What 
has 
happened?" 
asked 
Pierre, 
entering 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's 
room.

"Fine 
doings!" 
answered 
Dmitrievna. 
"For 
fifty-eight 
years 
have 
I 
lived
in 
this 
world 
and 
never 
known 
anything 
so 
disgraceful!"

And 
having 
put 
him 
on 
his 
honor 
not 
to 
repeat 
anything 
she 
told 
him,
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
informed 
him 
that 
Natasha 
had 
refused 
Prince 
Andrew
without 
her 
parents' 
knowledge 
and<p>
that 
the 
cause 
of 
this 
was 
Anatole
Kuragin 
into 
whose 
society 
Pierre's 
wife 
had 
thrown 
her 
and<p>
with 
whom
Natasha 
had 
tried 
to 
elope 
during 
her 
father's 
absence, 
in 
order 
to 
be
married 
secretly.

Pierre 
raised 
his 
shoulders 
and 
listened 
open-mouthed 
to 
what 
was 
told
him, 
scarcely 
able 
to 
believe 
his 
own 
ears. 
That 
Prince 
Andrew's
deeply 
loved 
affianced 
wife-the 
same 
Natasha 
Rostova 
who 
used 
to 
be 
so
charming-should 
give 
up 
Bolkonski 
for 
that 
fool 
Anatole 
who 
was 
already
secretly 
married 
(as 
Pierre 
knew), 
and 
should 
be 
so 
in 
love 
with 
him 
as
to 
agree 
to 
run 
away 
with 
him, 
was 
something 
Pierre 
could 
not 
conceive
and 
could 
not 
imagine.

He 
could 
not 
reconcile 
the 
charming 
impression 
he 
had 
of 
Natasha, 
whom
he 
had 
known 
from 
a 
child, 
with 
this 
new 
conception 
of 
her 
baseness,
folly, 
and 
cruelty. 
He 
thought 
of 
his 
wife. 
"They 
are 
all 
alike!" 
he
said 
to 
himself, 
reflecting 
that 
he 
was 
not 
the 
only 
man 
unfortunate
enough 
to 
be 
tied 
to 
a 
bad 
woman. 
But 
still 
he 
pitied 
Prince 
Andrew 
to
the 
point 
of 
tears 
and 
sympathized 
with 
his 
wounded 
pride, 
and 
the 
more
he 
pitied 
his 
friend 
the 
more 
did 
he 
think 
with 
contempt 
and 
even 
with
disgust 
of 
that 
Natasha 
who 
had 
just 
passed 
him 
in 
the 
ballroom 
with
such 
a 
look 
of 
cold 
dignity. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
that 
Natasha's 
soul 
was
overflowing 
with 
despair, 
shame, 
and 
humiliation, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
not
her 
fault 
that 
her 
face 
happened 
to 
assume 
an 
expression 
of 
calm 
dignity
and 
severity.

"But 
how 
get 
married?" 
said 
Pierre, 
in 
answer 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"He
could 
not 
marry-he 
is 
married!"

"Things 
get 
worse 
from 
hour 
to 
hour!" 
ejaculated 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"A
nice 
youth! 
What 
a 
scoundrel! 
And 
she's 
expecting 
him-expecting 
him
since 
yesterday. 
She

Then

she

over 
the

the

Thousands

rose 
above 
the 
walls 
and 
circled 
in 
the
air, 
cawing 
and 
noisily 
flapping 
their

Together 
with 
that 
sound
came 
a 
solitary 
human 
cry 
from 
the

and 
amid 
the 
smoke 
appeared
the 
figure 
of 
a 
bareheaded 
man 
in 
a 
peasant's 
coat. 
He 
grasped 
a 
musket
and 
took 
aim 
at 
the 
French. 
"Fire!" 
repeated 
the 
officer 
once 
more,
and 
the 
reports 
of 
a 
musket 
and 
of 
two 
cannon 
shots 
were 
heard
simultaneously. 
The

smoke.

Nothing 
more 
stirred 
behind 
the 
screens 
and 
the 
French 
infantry 
soldiers

officers 
advanced 
to 
the

In

lay 
three 
wounded

Two 
men 
in

ran 
away 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
wall,
toward 
the 
Znamenka.

Thiers

dedicates 
a 
few 
eloquent 
lines 
to
their 
memory: 
"These 
wretches 
had 
occupied 
the 
sacred 
citadel, 
having
supplied 
themselves 
with 
guns 
from 
the 
arsenal, 
and 
fired" 
(the
wretches) 
"at 
the 
French. 
Some 
of 
them 
were 
sabered 
and 
the 
Kremlin 
was
purged 
of 
their 
presence."

Murat 
was 
informed 
that 
the 
way 
had<p>
been 
cleared. 
The 
French 
entered
the

the 
Senate 
Square. 
Out

the 
Senate 
House 
the 
soldiers 
threw

CHAPTER

On

At

did 
not

He 
felt 
that

"I 
will 
do 
it 
all, 
Father," 
he 
said.

"Well, 
now, 
good-by!" 
He 
gave 
his 
son 
his 
hand 
to 
kiss, 
and 
embraced
him. 
"Remember 
this, 
Prince 
Andrew, 
if 
they 
kill 
you 
it 
will 
hurt 
me,
your 
old 
father..." 
he 
paused 
unexpectedly, 
and 
then 
in 
a 
querulous
voice 
suddenly 
shrieked: 
"but 
if 
I 
hear 
that 
you 
have 
not 
behaved 
like
a 
son 
of 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski, 
I 
shall 
be 
ashamed!"

"You 
need 
not 
have 
said 
that 
to 
me, 
Father," 
said 
the 
son 
with 
a
smile.

The 
old 
man 
was 
silent.

"I 
also 
wanted 
to 
ask 
you," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"if 
I'm
killed 
and 
if 
I 
have 
a 
son, 
do 
not 
let 
him 
be 
taken

from 
you-as 
I
said 
yesterday... 
let 
him 
grow 
up

you.... 
Please."

"Not 
let 
the 
wife 
have<p>
him?" 
said 
the 
old 
man, 
and 
laughed.

They 
stood 
silent, 
facing 
one 
another. 
The 
old 
man's 
sharp 
eyes 
were
fixed 
straight 
on 
his 
son's. 
Something 
twitched 
in 
the 
lower 
part 
of
the 
old 
prince's 
face.

"We've 
said 
good-by. 
Go!" 
he 
suddenly 
shouted 
in 
a 
loud, 
angry
voice, 
opening 
his 
door.

"What 
is 
it? 
What?" 
asked 
both 
princesses 
when 
they 
saw 
for 
a 
moment
at 
the 
door 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
the 
figure 
of 
the 
old 
man 
in 
a 
white
dressing 
gown, 
spectacled 
and 
wigless, 
shouting 
in 
an 
angry 
voice.

Prince 
Andrew 
sighed 
and 
made 
no 
reply.

"Well!" 
he<p>
said, 
turning 
to 
his 
wife.

And 
this 
"Well!" 
sounded<p>
coldly 
ironic, 
as 
if 
he 
were 
saying: 
"Now
go 
through 
your 
performance."

"Andrew, 
already!" 
said 
the 
little 
princess, 
turning 
pale 
and
looking 
with 
dismay 
at 
her 
husband.

He 
embraced 
her. 
She 
screamed 
and 
fell 
unconscious 
on 
his 
shoulder.

He 
cautiously 
released 
the 
shoulder 
she 
leaned 
on, 
looked 
into 
her 
face,
and 
carefully 
placed 
her 
in 
an 
easy 
chair.

"Adieu, 
Mary," 
said 
he 
gently 
to 
his 
sister, 
taking 
her 
by 
the 
hand
and 
kissing 
her, 
and 
then 
he 
left 
the 
room 
with 
rapid 
steps.

The 
little 
princess 
lay 
in 
the 
armchair, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
chafing
her 
temples. 
Princess 
Mary, 
supporting 
her 
sister-in-law, 
still 
looked
with 
her 
beautiful 
eyes 
full 
of 
tears 
at 
the 
door 
through 
which 
Prince
Andrew 
had 
gone 
and 
made 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
cross 
in 
his 
direction. 
From
the 
study, 
like 
pistol 
shots, 
came 
the 
frequent 
sound 
of 
the 
old 
man
angrily 
blowing 
his 
nose. 
Hardly 
had 
Prince 
Andrew 
gone 
when 
the 
study
door 
opened 
quickly 
and 
the 
stern 
figure 
of 
the 
old 
man 
in 
the 
white
dressing 
gown 
looked 
out.

"Gone? 
That's 
all 
right!" 
said 
he; 
and 
looking 
angrily 
at 
the
unconscious 
little 
princess, 
he 
shook 
his 
head 
reprovingly 
and 
slammed
the 
door.





BOOK 
TWO: 
1805





CHAPTER 
I

In 
October, 
1805, 
a 
Russian 
army 
was 
occupying 
the 
villages 
and 
towns 
of
the 
Archduchy 
of 
Austria, 
and 
yet 
other 
regiments 
freshly 
arriving 
from
Russia 
were 
settling 
near 
the 
fortress 
of 
Braunau 
and 
burdening 
the
inhabitants 
on 
whom 
they 
were 
quartered. 
Braunau 
was 
the 
headquarters 
of
the 
commander 
in 
chief, 
Kutuzov.

On 
October 
11, 
1805, 
one 
of 
the 
infantry 
regiments 
that 
had 
just 
reached
Braunau 
had 
halted 
half 
a 
mile 
from 
the 
town, 
waiting 
to 
be 
inspected
by 
the 
commander 
in 
chief. 
Despite 
the 
un-Russian 
appearance 
of 
the
locality 
and 
surroundings-fruit 
gardens, 
stone 
fences, 
tiled 
roofs,
and 
hills 
in 
the 
distance-and 
despite 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
inhabitants
(who 
gazed 
with 
curiosity 
at 
the 
soldiers) 
were 
not 
Russians, 
<a href="/cZl/Of2bWUL8.html">the
regiment</a> 
had 
just 
the 
appearance 
of 
any 
Russian 
regiment 
preparing 
for
an 
inspection 
anywhere 
in 
the 
heart 
of 
Russia.

On 
the 
evening 
of 
the 
last 
day's 
march 
an 
order 
had 
been 
received 
that
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
would 
inspect 
the 
regiment 
on 
the 
march. 
Though
the 
words 
of 
the 
order 
were 
not 
clear 
to 
the 
regimental 
commander, 
and
the 
question 
arose 
whether 
the 
troops 
were 
to 
be

<a href="/cZl/SE5HI7VWVhi6iGjCy.html">vulgar.</a> 
It

Rostopchin

even 
all

from 
Moscow, 
and 
that 
there 
had

some 
spies

of

them; 
but 
this 
was 
told 
chiefly 
to 
introduce 
Rostopchin's 
witty
remark 
on 
that 
occasion. 
The 
foreigners 
were 
deported 
to 
Nizhni 
by
boat, 
and 
Rostopchin 
had 
said 
to 
them 
in 
French: 
"Rentrez 
en 
vous-memes;
entrez 
dans 
la 
barque, 
et 
n'en 
faites 
pas 
une<p>
barque 
de 
Charon." 
* 
There
was 
talk 
of 
all 
the 
government 
offices 
having 
been 
<a href="/cZl/FvO6hai1bvg.html">already</a> 
removed 
from
Moscow, 
and 
to 
this 
Shinshin's 
witticism 
was 
added-that 
for 
that 
alone
Moscow 
ought 
to 
be 
grateful 
to 
Napoleon. 
It 
was 
said 
that 
Mamonov's
regiment 
would 
cost 
him 
eight 
hundred 
thousand 
rubles, 
and 
that 
Bezukhov
had 
spent 
even 
more 
on 
his, 
but 
that 
the 
best 
thing 
about 
Bezukhov's
action 
was 
that 
he 
himself 
was 
going 
to 
don 
a 
uniform 
and 
ride 
at 
the
head 
of 
his

dare 
not 
even 
mention 
the 
matter

the

Pity 
these
wounded

might, 
it 
was 
evident 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/itU7CT29bqaJj.html">that</a>

Thirty

could 
not

wounded
and 
in 
the 
general 
catastrophe 
one 
could 
not 
disregard 
oneself 
and 
one's
own 
family. 
So 
thought 
the 
major-domo 
on 
his 
master's 
behalf.

On 
waking 
up 
that 
morning 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov 
left 
his 
bedroom 
softly, 
so
as 
not 
to 
wake 
the 
countess 
who 
had 
fallen 
asleep 
only 
toward 
morning,
and 
came 
out 
to 
the 
porch 
in 
his 
lilac 
silk 
dressing 
gown. 
In 
the 
yard
stood 
the 
carts 
ready 
corded. 
The 
carriages 
were 
at 
the 
front 
porch.
The 
major-domo 
stood 
at 
the 
porch 
talking 
to 
an 
elderly 
orderly 
and 
to
a 
pale 
young 
officer 
with 
a 
bandaged 
arm. 
On 
seeing 
the 
count 
the
major-domo 
made 
a 
significant 
and 
stern 
gesture 
to 
them 
both 
to 
go 
away.

"Well, 
Vasilich, 
is 
everything 
ready?" 
asked 
the 
count, 
and 
stroking 
his
bald 
head 
he 
looked<p>
good-naturedly 
at 
the 
officer 
and 
the 
orderly 
and
nodded 
to 
them. 
(He 
liked 
to 
see 
new 
faces.)

"We 
can

at 
once, 
your

"Well, 
that's

As 
soon 
as 
the

wakes 
we'll 
be 
off, 
God

What 
is 
it, 
gentlemen?" 
he 
added, 
turning 
to 
the 
officer. 
"Are
you 
staying 
in 
my 
house?"

The 
officer 
came 
nearer 
and 
suddenly 
his 
face 
flushed 
crimson.

"Count,

so 
good

But

that

rose

"What

Nonsense,

He 
went 
up 
to 
the 
map 
and 
speaking 
rapidly 
began 
proving 
that 
no
eventuality 
could 
alter 
the 
efficiency 
of 
the 
Drissa 
camp, 
that
everything 
had 
been

that 
if 
the

were 
really

outflank 
it, 
the 
enemy 
would 
inevitably 
be 
destroyed.

Paulucci,

questioning

Wolzogen 
came 
to

spoke 
French 
badly,

for 
him, 
hardly 
able

keep

Pfuel,

again 
on

complacently: 
"Let

that 
Lavrushka-that 
sly, 
bold

of 
Denisov's-was 
talking, 
as

Lavrushka 
was 
saying 
something 
about 
loaded 
wagons, 
biscuits,

oxen
he 
had 
seen 
when 
he 
had 
gone 
out 
for

Then 
Denisov's 
voice 
was 
heard 
shouting 
farther 
and 
farther 
away.
"Saddle! 
Second 
platoon!"

"Where 
are 
they 
off 
to 
now?" 
thought 
Rostov.

Five 
minutes 
later, 
Denisov 
came 
into 
the 
hut, 
climbed 
with 
muddy 
boots
on 
the 
bed, 
lit 
his 
pipe, 
furiously 
scattered 
his 
things 
<a href="/cZl/At7Jk8xt2r.html">about,</a> 
took
his 
leaded 
whip, 
buckled 
on 
his 
saber, 
and 
went 
out 
again. 
In 
answer 
to
Rostov's 
inquiry 
where 
he 
was 
going, 
he 
answered 
vaguely 
and 
crossly
that 
he 
had 
some 
business.

"Let 
God 
and 
our 
gweat 
monarch 
judge 
me 
afterwards!" 
said 
Denisov
going 
out, 
and 
Rostov 
heard 
the 
hoofs 
of 
several 
horses 
splashing
through 
the 
mud. 
He 
did 
not 
even 
trouble 
to

Denisov

gone. 
Having 
got 
warm 
in 
his

he 
fell 
asleep 
and 
did 
not 
leave
the 
hut 
till 
toward

Denisov

not

The

two 
officers

were
playing

him 
the 
storm 
had 
blown 
over, 
and 
that 
Kutuzov
would 
content 
himself<p>
with 
that 
hint.

"He's 
having 
a 
little 
fun 
at 
my 
expense," 
said 
Ermolov 
softly, 
nudging
with 
his 
knee 
Raevski 
who 
was 
at 
his 
side.

Soon 
after 
this, 
Ermolov 
moved 
up 
to 
Kutuzov 
and 
respectfully 
remarked:

"It 
is 
not 
too 
late 
yet, 
your 
Highness-the 
enemy 
has 
not 
gone 
away-if
you 
were 
to 
order 
an 
attack! 
If 
not, 
the 
Guards 
will 
not 
so 
much 
as 
see
a 
little 
smoke."

Kutuzov 
did 
not 
reply, 
but 
when 
they 
reported 
to 
him 
that 
Murat's 
troops
were 
in 
retreat 
he 
ordered 
an 
advance, 
though 
at 
every 
hundred 
paces 
he
halted 
for 
three 
quarters 
of 
an 
hour.

The 
whole 
battle 
consisted 
in 
what 
Orlov-Denisov's 
Cossacks 
had 
done:
the 
rest 
of 
the 
army 
merely 
lost 
some 
hundreds 
of 
men 
uselessly.

In 
consequence 
of 
this 
battle 
Kutuzov 
received 
a 
diamond 
decoration,
and 
Bennigsen 
some 
diamonds 
and 
a 
hundred 
thousand 
rubles, 
others 
also
received 
pleasant 
recognitions 
corresponding 
to 
their 
various 
grades,
and 
following 
the 
battle 
fresh 
changes 
were 
made 
in 
the 
staff.

"That's 
how 
everything 
is 
done 
with 
us, 
all 
topsy-turvy!" 
said 
the
Russian 
officers<p>
and 
generals 
after 
the 
Tarutino 
battle, 
letting 
it 
be
understood 
that 
some 
fool 
there 
is 
doing 
things 
all 
wrong 
but 
that
we 
ourselves 
should 
not 
have 
done 
so, 
just 
as 
people 
speak 
today. 
But
people 
who 
talk 
like 
that 
either 
do 
not 
know 
what 
they 
are 
talking 
about
or 
deliberately 
deceive 
themselves. 
No 
battle-Tarutino, 
Borodino, 
or
Austerlitz-takes 
place 
as 
those 
who 
planned 
it 
anticipated. 
That 
is 
an
essential 
condition.

A 
countless 
number 
of 
free 
forces 
(for 
nowhere 
is 
man 
freer 
than 
during
a 
battle, 
where 
it 
is 
a 
question 
of 
life 
and 
death) 
influence 
the 
course
taken 
by 
the 
fight, 
and 
that 
course 
never 
can 
be 
known 
in 
advance 
and
never 
coincides 
with 
the 
direction 
of 
any 
one 
force.

If 
many 
simultaneously 
and 
variously 
directed 
forces 
act 
on 
a 
given
body, 
the<p>
direction 
of 
its 
motion 
cannot 
coincide 
with 
any 
one 
of 
those
forces, 
but 
will 
always 
be 
a 
mean-what 
in 
mechanics 
is 
represented 
by
the 
diagonal 
of 
a 
parallelogram 
of 
forces.

If 
in 
the 
descriptions 
given 
by 
historians, 
especially 
French 
ones, 
we
find 
their 
wars 
and 
battles 
carried 
out 
in 
accordance 
with 
previously
formed 
plans, 
the 
only 
conclusion 
to 
be 
drawn 
is 
that 
those 
descriptions
are 
false.

The 
battle 
of 
Tarutino 
obviously 
did 
not 
attain 
the 
aim 
Toll 
had 
in
view-to 
lead 
the 
troops 
into 
action 
in 
the 
order 
prescribed 
by 
the
dispositions; 
nor 
that 
which 
Count 
Orlov-Denisov 
may 
have 
had 
in 
view-to
take 
Murat 
prisoner; 
nor 
the 
result 
of 
immediately 
destroying 
the 
whole
corps, 
which 
Bennigsen 
and 
others 
may 
have 
had 
in 
view; 
nor 
the 
aim 
of
the 
officer 
who 
wished

He 
did

"But 
how 
get 
married?" 
said 
Pierre, 
in 
answer 
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"He
could 
not 
marry-he 
is 
married!"

"Things 
get 
worse 
from

ejaculated 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"A

What 
a 
scoundrel! 
And 
she's 
expecting

him
since 
yesterday. 
She 
must 
be 
told! 
Then 
at 
least 
she 
won't 
go 
on
expecting 
him."

After 
hearing 
the 
details<p>
of 
Anatole's 
marriage 
from 
Pierre, 
and 
giving
vent 
to 
her 
anger 
against 
Anatole 
in 
words 
of 
abuse, 
Marya 
Dmitrievna
told 
Pierre 
why 
she 
had 
sent 
for 
him. 
She 
was 
afraid 
that 
the 
count 
or
Bolkonski, 
who 
might 
arrive 
at 
any 
moment, 
if 
they 
knew 
of 
this 
affair
(which 
she 
hoped 
to 
hide 
from 
them) 
might 
challenge 
Anatole 
to 
a 
duel,
and 
she 
therefore 
asked 
Pierre 
to 
tell 
his 
brother-in-law 
in 
her 
name 
to
leave 
Moscow 
and 
not 
dare 
to 
let 
her 
set 
eyes 
on 
him 
again. 
Pierre-only
now 
realizing 
the 
danger 
to 
the 
old 
count, 
Nicholas, 
and 
Prince
Andrew-promised 
to 
do 
as 
she 
wished. 
Having 
briefly 
and 
exactly
explained 
her 
wishes 
to 
him, 
she 
let 
him 
go 
to 
the 
drawing 
room.

"Mind, 
the 
count 
knows 
nothing. 
Behave 
as 
if 
you 
know 
nothing 
either,"
she 
said. 
"And 
I 
will 
go 
and 
tell 
her 
it 
is 
no 
use 
expecting 
him! 
And
stay 
to 
dinner 
if 
you 
care 
to!" 
she 
called 
after 
Pierre.

Pierre 
met 
the 
old 
count, 
who 
seemed 
nervous 
and 
upset. 
That 
morning
Natasha 
had 
told 
him 
that 
she 
had 
rejected 
Bolkonski.

"Troubles, 
troubles, 
my 
dear 
fellow!" 
he 
said 
to 
Pierre. 
"What 
troubles
one 
has 
with 
these 
girls 
without 
their 
mother! 
I 
do 
so 
regret 
having
come 
here.... 
I 
will 
be 
frank 
with 
you. 
Have 
you 
heard 
she 
has<p>
broken
off 
her 
engagement 
without 
consulting 
anybody? 
It's 
true 
this 
engagement
never 
was 
much 
to 
my 
liking. 
Of 
course 
he 
is 
an 
excellent 
man, 
but
still, 
with 
his 
father's 
disapproval 
they 
wouldn't 
have 
been 
happy, 
and
Natasha 
won't 
lack 
suitors. 
Still, 
it 
has 
been 
going 
on 
so 
long, 
and
to 
take 
such 
a 
step 
without 
father's<p>
or 
mother's 
consent! 
And 
now 
she's
ill, 
and 
God 
knows 
what! 
It's 
hard, 
Count, 
hard 
to 
manage 
daughters 
in
their 
mother's 
absence...."

Pierre 
saw 
that 
the 
count 
was 
much 
upset 
and 
tried 
to 
change 
the
subject, 
but 
the 
count 
returned 
to 
his 
troubles.

Sonya 
entered 
the 
room 
with 
an 
agitated 
face.

"Natasha 
is 
not 
quite 
well; 
she's 
in 
her 
room 
and 
would 
like 
to 
see 
you.
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
is 
with 
her 
and 
she 
too 
asks 
you 
to 
come."

"Yes, 
you 
are 
a 
great 
friend 
of 
Bolkonski's, 
no 
doubt 
she 
wants 
to 
send
him 
a 
message," 
said 
the 
count. 
"Oh 
dear! 
Oh 
dear! 
How 
happy 
it 
all
was!"

And 
clutching 
the 
spare 
gray 
locks 
on 
his 
temples 
the 
count 
left 
<a href="/cZl/vwO3AzQCY4xLYdP.html">the
room.

When</a> 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
told 
Natasha 
that 
Anatole 
was 
married, 
Natasha
did 
not 
wish 
to 
believe 
it 
and 
insisted 
on 
having 
it 
confirmed 
by 
Pierre
himself. 
Sonya 
told 
Pierre 
this 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dt17xHdu3.html">as</a> 
she 
led 
him 
along 
the 
corridor 
to
Natasha's 
room.

Natasha, 
pale 
and 
stern, 
was 
sitting 
beside 
Marya 
Dmitrievna, 
and 
her
eyes, 
glittering 
feverishly, 
met 
Pierre 
with 
a 
questioning 
look 
the
moment 
he 
entered. 
She 
did 
not 
smile 
or 
nod, 
but 
only 
gazed 
fixedly 
at
him, 
and 
her 
look 
asked 
only 
one 
thing: 
was 
he 
a 
friend, 
or 
like 
the
others 
an 
enemy 
in 
regard 
to 
Anatole? 
As 
for 
Pierre, 
he 
evidently 
did
not 
exist 
for 
her.

"He 
knows 
all 
about 
it," 
said 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
pointing 
to 
Pierre 
and
addressing 
Natasha. 
"Let 
him 
tell 
you 
whether 
I 
have 
told 
the 
truth."

Natasha 
looked<p>

to

and 
wounded

Yet 
some

"What

"If

hurry 
up

thought 
he 
on 
his 
way 
to 
the 
house.

On 
the 
Tverskoy 
Boulevard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
called 
to 
him.

"Pierre! 
Been 
back 
long?" 
someone 
shouted. 
Pierre 
raised 
his 
head. 
In
a 
sleigh 
drawn 
by 
two 
gray 
trotting-horses 
that 
were 
bespattering 
the
dashboard 
with 
snow, 
Anatole 
and 
his 
constant 
companion 
<a href="/cZl/Cc7O0iPTJ9l.html">Makarin</a> 
dashed
past. 
Anatole 
was 
sitting 
upright 
in 
the 
classic 
pose 
of 
military
dandies, 
the<p>
lower 
part 
of 
his 
face 
hidden 
by 
his 
beaver 
collar 
and 
his
head 
slightly 
bent. 
His 
face 
was 
fresh 
and 
rosy, 
his 
white-plumed 
hat,
tilted 
to 
one 
side, 
disclosed 
his 
curled 
and 
pomaded 
hair 
besprinkled
with 
powdery 
snow.

"Yes, 
indeed, 
that's 
a 
true 
sage," 
thought 
Pierre. 
"He 
sees 
nothing
beyond 
the 
pleasure 
of 
the 
moment, 
nothing 
troubles 
him 
and 
so 
he 
is
always 
cheerful, 
satisfied, 
and 
serene. 
What 
wouldn't 
I 
give 
to 
be

him!" 
he 
thought 
enviously.

In 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's 
anteroom 
the 
footman 
who 
helped 
him 
off 
with 
his
fur 
coat 
said 
that 
the 
mistress 
asked 
him 
to 
come 
to 
her 
bedroom.

When 
he 
opened 
the 
ballroom 
door 
<a href="/aVzUge/nI7CX0J2oqP.html">Pierre</a> 
saw 
Natasha 
sitting 
at 
the
window, 
with 
a 
thin, 
pale, 
and 
spiteful 
face. 
She 
glanced 
round 
at 
him,
frowned, 
and 
left 
the 
room 
with 
an 
expression 
of 
cold 
dignity.

"What

Pierre, 
entering 
Marya 
Dmitrievna's

"Fine

answered 
Dmitrievna. 
"For 
fifty-eight 
years 
have 
I 
lived
in 
this 
world 
and 
never

anything

disgraceful!"

And 
having 
put 
him 
on 
his 
honor 
not

repeat 
anything 
she 
told 
him,
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
informed

Pierre's

thrown 
her

with

Natasha 
had

during 
her 
father's 
absence, 
in 
order 
to 
be

secretly.

Pierre 
raised

could 
be 
<a href="/cZl/kt2kz2w9dJM.html">cruel</a>

to

Berg 
explained 
so 
clearly 
why 
he 
wanted 
to 
collect 
at<p>
his

a

Having 
prepared 
everything 
necessary 
for 
the 
party, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gl6U83vGF.html">the</a> 
Bergs 
were 
ready
for 
their 
guests' 
arrival.

In 
their 
new, 
clean, 
and 
light 
study 
with 
its 
small 
busts 
and 
pictures
and 
new 
furniture 
sat 
Berg 
and 
his 
wife. 
Berg, 
closely 
buttoned 
up 
in
his 
new 
uniform, 
sat 
beside 
his 
wife 
explaining 
to 
her 
that 
one 
always
could 
and 
should 
be 
acquainted 
with 
people 
above 
one, 
because 
only 
then
does 
one 
get 
satisfaction<p>
from 
acquaintances.

"You 
can 
get 
to 
know 
something, 
you 
can 
ask 
for 
something. 
See 
how 
I
managed 
from 
my 
first 
promotion." 
(Berg 
measured 
his 
life 
not 
by 
years
but 
by 
promotions.) 
"My 
comrades 
are 
still 
nobodies, 
while 
I 
am 
only
waiting 
for 
a 
vacancy 
to 
command 
a 
regiment, 
and 
have 
the 
happiness 
to
be 
your 
husband." 
(He 
rose 
and 
kissed 
Vera's 
hand, 
and 
on 
the 
way
to 
her 
straightened 
out 
a 
turned-up 
corner 
of 
the 
carpet.) 
"And
how 
have 
I 
obtained 
all 
this? 
Chiefly 
by 
knowing 
how 
to 
choose 
my
aquaintances. 
It 
goes 
without 
saying 
that 
one 
must 
be 
conscientious 
and
methodical."

Berg 
smiled 
with 
a 
sense<p>
of 
his 
superiority 
over 
a 
weak 
woman, 
and
paused, 
reflecting 
that 
this 
dear 
wife 
of 
his 
was 
after<p>
all 
but 
a 
weak
woman 
who 
could 
not 
understand 
all 
that 
constitutes 
a 
man's 
dignity,
what 
it 
was

zu 
sein.

with 
his 
bony

"What

Nonsense,

He 
went 
up 
to

speaking

proving 
that 
no

could 
alter 
the

of 
the

that
everything 
had 
been

that 
if

Paulucci, 
who 
did 
not 
know 
German, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JM10WMYlo2A.html">began</a> 
questioning 
him 
in<p>
French.
Wolzogen 
came 
to 
the 
assistance 
of 
his 
chief, 
who 
spoke 
French 
badly,
and 
began 
translating 
for 
him, 
hardly 
able 
to 
keep 
pace 
with 
Pfuel, 
who
was 
rapidly 
demonstrating 
that 
not 
only 
all 
that 
had 
happened, 
but 
all
that 
could 
happen, 
had 
been 
foreseen 
in 
his 
scheme, 
and 
that 
if 
there
were 
now 
any 
difficulties 
the 
whole 
fault 
lay 
in 
the 
fact 
that 
his 
plan
had 
not 
been 
precisely 
executed. 
He 
kept 
laughing 
sarcastically, 
he
demonstrated, 
and 
at 
last 
contemptuously 
ceased 
to 
demonstrate, 
like
a

Wolzogen

French,

But 
Pfuel,

In 
Petersburg,</h1>as 
in 
Moscow, 
Pierre 
found 
the 
same 
atmosphere 
of
gentleness 
and 
affection. 
He 
could 
not 
refuse 
the 
post, 
or 
rather 
the
rank 
(for 
he 
did 
nothing), 
that 
Prince 
Vasili 
had 
procured 
for 
him,
and 
acquaintances, 
invitations, 
and 
social 
occupations 
were 
so 
numerous
that, 
even 
more 
than 
in 
Moscow, 
he 
felt 
a 
sense 
of 
bewilderment, 
bustle,
and 
continual 
expectation 
of 
some 
good, 
always 
in 
front 
of 
him 
but 
never
attained.

Of 
his 
former 
bachelor 
acquaintances 
many 
were 
no 
longer 
in 
Petersburg.
The 
Guards 
had 
gone 
to 
the 
front; 
Dolokhov 
had 
been 
reduced 
to 
the
ranks; 
Anatole 
was 
in 
the 
army 
somewhere 
in 
the 
provinces; 
Prince 
Andrew
was 
abroad; 
so 
Pierre 
had 
not 
the 
opportunity 
to 
spend 
his 
nights 
as 
he
used 
to 
like 
to 
spend 
them, 
or 
to 
open 
his 
mind 
by 
intimate 
talks 
with
a 
friend 
older 
than 
himself 
and 
whom 
he 
respected. 
His 
whole 
time
was 
taken 
up 
with 
dinners 
and 
balls 
and 
was 
spent 
chiefly 
at 
Prince
Vasili's 
house 
in 
the 
company 
of 
the 
stout 
princess, 
his 
wife, 
and
his 
beautiful 
daughter 
Helene.

Like 
the 
others, 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
Scherer 
showed 
Pierre 
the 
change 
of
attitude 
toward 
him 
that 
had 
taken 
place 
in 
society.

Formerly 
in 
Anna 
Pavlovna's 
presence, 
Pierre 
had 
always 
felt 
that
what 
he<p>
was 
saying 
was 
out 
of 
place, 
tactless 
and 
unsuitable, 
that
remarks 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
clever 
while 
they 
formed 
in 
his 
mind 
became
foolish 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
uttered 
them, 
while 
on 
the 
contrary 
Hippolyte's
stupidest 
remarks 
came 
out 
clever 
and 
apt. 
Now 
everything 
Pierre 
said
was 
charmant. 
Even 
if 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
did 
not 
say 
so, 
he 
could 
see 
that
she 
wished 
to 
and 
only 
refrained 
out 
of 
regard 
for 
his 
modesty.

In 
the 
beginning 
of 
the 
winter 
of 
1805-6 
Pierre 
received 
one 
of 
Anna
Pavlovna's 
usual 
pink 
notes 
with 
<a href="/aVzUge/ZUI6tQp05Akk.html">an</a> 
invitation 
to 
which 
was 
added:
"You 
will 
find 
the 
beautiful 
Helene 
here, 
whom 
it 
is 
always
delightful 
to 
see."

When 
he 
read 
that 
sentence, 
Pierre 
felt 
for 
the 
first 
time 
that 
some
link 
which 
other 
people 
recognized 
had 
grown 
up 
between 
himself 
and
Helene, 
and 
that 
thought 
both 
alarmed 
him, 
as 
if 
some 
obligation 
were
being 
imposed 
on 
him 
which 
he 
could 
not 
fulfill, 
and 
pleased 
him 
as 
an
entertaining 
supposition.

Anna 
Pavlovna's 
"At 
Home" 
was 
like 
the 
former 
one, 
only 
the
novelty 
she 
offered 
her 
guests 
this 
time 
was 
not 
Mortemart, 
but 
a
diplomatist 
fresh 
from 
Berlin 
with 
the 
very 
latest 
details 
of 
the
Emperor 
Alexander's 
visit 
to 
Potsdam, 
and 
of 
how 
the 
two 
august
friends 
had 
pledged 
themselves 
in 
an 
indissoluble<p>
alliance 
to 
uphold
the 
cause 
of 
justice 
against 
the 
enemy 
of 
the 
human 
race.

The

together

governor's

the

in
Voronezh.

There 
were 
a 
great 
many

there 
were 
no

who 
could 
at 
all 
vie 
with 
the
cavalier 
of 
St. 
George, 
the 
hussar 
remount 
officer, 
the 
good-natured
and 
well-bred 
Count 
Rostov. 
Among 
the 
men 
was 
an 
Italian 
prisoner, 
an
officer 
of 
the 
French 
army; 
and 
Nicholas 
felt 
that 
the 
presence 
of 
that
prisoner 
enhanced 
his 
own 
importance 
as 
a 
Russian 
hero. 
The 
Italian
was, 
as 
it 
were, 
a 
war 
trophy. 
Nicholas 
felt 
this, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him
that 
everyone 
regarded 
the 
Italian 
in 
the 
same 
light, 
and 
he 
treated 
him
cordially 
though 
with 
dignity 
and 
restraint.

As 
soon 
as 
Nicholas 
entered 
in 
his 
hussar 
uniform, 
diffusing 
around 
him
a 
fragrance 
of 
perfume 
and 
wine, 
and 
had 
uttered 
the 
words 
"better 
late
than 
never" 
and 
heard 
them 
repeated 
several 
times 
by 
others, 
people
clustered 
around 
him; 
all 
eyes 
turned 
on 
him, 
and 
he 
felt 
at 
once
that 
he 
had 
entered 
into 
his 
proper 
position 
in 
the 
province-that 
of
a 
universal 
favorite: 
a<p>
very 
pleasant 
position, 
and 
intoxicatingly 
so
after 
his 
long 
privations. 
At 
posting 
stations, 
at 
inns, 
and<p>
in 
the
landowner's 
snuggery, 
maidservants 
had 
been 
flattered 
by 
his 
notice, 
and
here 
too 
at 
the 
governor's 
party 
there 
were 
(as 
it 
seemed 
to 
Nicholas)
an 
inexhaustible 
number 
of 
pretty 
young 
women, 
married 
and 
unmarried,
impatiently 
awaiting 
his 
notice. 
The 
women 
and 
girls 
flirted 
with 
him
and, 
from 
the 
first 
day, 
the 
people 
concerned 
themselves 
to 
get 
this
fine 
young 
daredevil 
of 
an 
hussar 
married 
and 
settled 
down. 
Among 
these
was 
the 
governor's 
wife 
herself, 
who<p>
welcomed 
Rostov 
as 
a 
near 
relative
and 
called 
him 
"Nicholas."

Catherine 
Petrovna 
did 
actually 
play 
valses 
and 
the 
ecossaise, 
and
dancing 
began 
in 
which 
Nicholas 
still 
further 
captivated 
the 
provincial
society 
by 
his 
agility. 
His 
particularly 
free 
manner<p>
of 
dancing 
even
surprised 
them 
all. 
Nicholas 
was 
himself 
rather 
surprised 
at 
the 
way 
he
danced 
that 
evening. 
He 
had 
never 
danced 
like 
that 
in 
Moscow 
and 
would
even 
have 
considered 
such 
a 
very 
free 
and 
easy 
manner 
improper 
and 
in
bad 
form, 
but 
here 
he 
felt 
it 
incumbent 
on 
him 
to 
astonish 
them 
all 
by
something 
unusual, 
something 
they 
would 
have 
to 
accept 
as 
the 
regular
thing 
in 
the 
capital 
though 
new 
to 
them 
in 
the 
provinces.

All 
the 
evening 
Nicholas 
paid 
attention 
to 
a 
blue-eyed, 
plump 
and
pleasing 
little 
blonde, 
the

of

two!" 
they
shouted.

This 
meant 
two 
stockings, 
which 
by 
a 
secret 
process 
known 
only 
to
herself 
Anna 
Makarovna 
used 
to 
knit 
at 
the 
same 
time 
on 
the 
same
needles, 
and 
which, 
when 
they 
were 
ready, 
she 
always 
triumphantly 
drew,
one 
out 
of 
the 
other, 
in 
the 
children's 
presence.





CHAPTER 
XIV

Soon 
after 
this 
the 
children 
came 
in 
to<p>
say 
good 
night. 
They 
kissed
everyone, 
the 
tutors 
and 
governesses 
made 
their 
bows, 
and 
they 
went 
out.
Only 
young 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
tutor 
remained. 
Dessalles 
whispered 
to 
the
boy 
to 
come 
downstairs.

"No, 
Monsieur 
Dessalles, 
I 
will 
ask 
my 
aunt 
to 
let 
me 
stay," 
replied
Nicholas 
Bolkonski 
also 
in 
a 
whisper.

"Ma 
tante, 
please 
let 
me 
stay," 
said 
he, 
going 
up 
to 
his 
aunt.

His 
face 
expressed 
entreaty, 
agitation, 
and 
ecstasy. 
Countess 
Mary
glanced 
at 
him 
and 
turned 
to 
Pierre.

"When 
you 
are 
here 
he 
can't 
tear 
himself 
away," 
she 
said.

"I 
will 
bring 
him 
to 
you 
directly, 
Monsieur 
Dessalles. 
Good 
night!"
said 
Pierre, 
giving 
his 
hand 
to 
the 
Swiss 
tutor, 
and 
he 
turned 
to 
young
Nicholas 
with 
a 
smile. 
"You 
and 
I 
haven't 
seen 
anything 
of 
one 
another
yet.... 
How 
like 
he 
is 
growing, 
Mary!" 
he 
added, 
addressing 
Countess
Mary.

"Like 
my 
father?" 
asked 
the 
boy, 
flushing 
crimson 
and 
looking 
up 
at
Pierre 
with 
bright, 
ecstatic 
eyes.

Pierre 
nodded, 
and 
went 
on 
with 
what 
he 
had 
been 
saying 
when 
the
children 
had 
interrupted. 
Countess 
Mary 
sat 
down 
doing 
woolwork; 
Natasha
did 
not 
take 
her 
eyes 
off 
her 
husband. 
Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
rose, 
asked
for 
their 
pipes, 
smoked, 
went 
to 
fetch 
more 
tea 
from 
Sonya-who 
sat 
weary
but 
resolute 
at 
the 
samovar-and 
questioned 
Pierre. 
The 
curly-headed,
delicate 
boy 
sat 
with 
shining 
eyes 
unnoticed 
in 
a 
corner, 
starting
every 
now 
and 
then 
and 
muttering 
something 
to 
himself, 
and 
evidently
experiencing 
a<p>
new 
and 
powerful 
emotion 
as 
he 
turned 
his 
curly 
head,
with<p>
his 
thin 
neck 
exposed 
by 
his 
turn-down 
collar, 
toward 
the 
place
where 
Pierre 
sat.

The 
conversation 
turned 
on<p>
the 
contemporary 
gossip 
about 
those 
in 
power,
in 
which 
most 
people 
see 
the 
chief 
interest 
of 
home 
politics. 
Denisov,
dissatisfied 
with 
the 
government 
on 
account 
of 
his 
own 
disappointments
in 
the 
service, 
heard 
with 
pleasure 
of 
the 
things 
done 
in 
Petersburg
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
stupid, 
and 
made 
forcible 
and 
sharp 
comments 
on 
what
Pierre 
told 
them.

"One 
used 
to 
have 
to 
be 
a 
German-now 
one 
must 
dance 
with 
Tatawinova
and 
Madame 
Kwuedener, 
and 
wead 
Ecka'tshausen 
and 
the 
bwethwen. 
Oh, 
they
should 
let 
that 
fine<p>
fellow 
Bonaparte 
loose-he'd 
knock 
all 
this 
nonsense
out 
of 
them! 
Fancy 
giving 
the 
command 
of 
the 
Semenov 
wegiment 
to 
a
fellow 
like 
that 
Schwa'tz!" 
he 
cried.

Nicholas, 
though 
free 
from 
Denisov's 
readiness 
to 
find 
fault 
with
everything, 
also 
thought 
that 
discussion 
of 
the 
government 
was 
a 
very
serious 
and 
weighty 
matter, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
A 
had 
been 
appointed

of

his
audience

"I 
say 
so," 
he 
continued 
desperately,

fled
from

suggested 
Anna

But 
Pierre 
continued 
his 
speech 
without 
heeding 
her.

"No," 
cried 
he, 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
eager, 
"Napoleon 
is 
great
because 
he 
rose 
superior

"Yes,

remarked 
the 
vicomte.

"He

desperate

twenty-seven; 
red-faced, 
with 
a

red 
thick

paper, 
all 
these 
columns
arrived 
at 
their

at

Everything

From 
the

a

like 
a 
bird
whirring 
in 
rapid 
flight

alighting 
on 
the

with 
little 
noise 
within 
two 
steps 
of 
Prince 
Andrew 
and 
close 
to 
the

commander's 
horse. 
The 
horse 
first, 
regardless 
of 
whether 
it
was 
right 
or 
wrong 
to 
show 
fear, 
snorted, 
reared 
almost 
throwing

galloped 
aside. 
The

terror 
infected 
the 
men.

"Lie 
down!" 
cried 
the 
adjutant, 
throwing 
himself 
flat 
on 
the 
ground.

Prince 
Andrew 
hesitated. 
The 
smoking 
shell 
spun 
like 
a 
top 
between 
him
and 
the 
prostrate 
adjutant, 
near 
a 
wormwood 
plant 
between 
the 
field 
and
the 
meadow.

"Can 
this 
be 
death?" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
with 
a 
quite 
new,
envious 
glance 
at 
the 
grass, 
the 
wormwood, 
and 
the 
streamlet 
of 
smoke
that 
curled 
up 
from 
the 
rotating 
black 
ball. 
"I 
cannot, 
I 
do 
not 
wish 
to
die. 
I 
love 
life-I 
love 
this 
grass, 
this 
earth, 
this 
air...." 
He 
thought
this, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
time 
remembered 
that 
people 
were 
looking 
at 
him.

"It's 
shameful, 
sir!" 
he 
said 
to 
the 
adjutant. 
"What..."

He 
did 
not 
finish 
speaking. 
At 
one

the

moment 
came 
the 
sound 
of
an 
explosion, 
a 
whistle 
of 
splinters 
as 
from 
a 
breaking 
window 
frame,
a 
suffocating 
smell 
of 
powder, 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
started 
to 
one 
side,
raising 
his 
arm, 
and 
fell 
on 
his 
chest. 
Several 
officers 
ran 
up 
to 
him.
From 
the 
right 
side 
of 
his 
abdomen, 
blood 
was 
welling 
out 
making 
a 
large
stain 
on 
the 
grass.

The 
militiamen 
with 
stretchers 
who 
were 
called 
up 
stood 
behind 
the
officers. 
Prince 
Andrew 
lay 
on 
his<p>
chest 
with 
his 
face 
in 
the 
grass,
breathing 
heavily 
and 
noisily.

"What 
are 
you 
waiting 
for? 
Come 
along!"

The 
peasants 
went 
up 
and 
took 
him 
by 
his 
shoulders 
and 
legs, 
but 
he
moaned 
piteously 
and, 
exchanging 
looks, 
they 
set 
him 
down 
again.

"Pick 
him 
up, 
lift 
him, 
it's 
all 
the 
same!" 
cried 
someone.

They 
again 
took 
him 
by 
the 
shoulders 
and 
laid 
him 
on 
the 
stretcher.

"Ah, 
God! 
My 
God! 
What 
is 
it? 
The 
stomach? 
That 
means 
death! 
My
God!"-voices 
among 
the 
officers 
were 
heard 
saying.

"It 
flew 
a 
hair's 
breadth 
past 
my 
ear," 
said<p>
the

The 
peasants, 
adjusting 
the 
stretcher 
to 
their 
shoulders, 
started
hurriedly 
along

path 
they 
had 
trodden 
down, 
to 
the 
dressing 
station.

"Keep

Ah...

an 
officer, 
seizing 
by
their

He

That

All 
the

gaily

The

who

with

continued 
to

a

The

began 
to 
disport 
themselves 
in 
the

sky: 
now 
flaring
up,

they

The 
day 
after

Rostovs 
went 
nowhere 
and 
nobody 
came 
to 
see
them. 
Marya 
Dmitrievna 
talked 
to

about 
something 
which 
they
concealed 
from 
Natasha. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ws76v3.html">Natasha</a>

She 
was 
expecting 
Prince 
Andrew 
any

twice 
that 
day 
sent 
a
manservant 
to 
the

ascertain 
whether

He 
had
not

She 
suffered 
more 
now 
than 
during 
her 
first 
days 
in 
Moscow.
To 
her 
impatience 
and 
pining 
for 
him 
were 
now 
added 
the 
unpleasant
recollection 
of 
her 
interview 
with 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
the 
old 
prince,
and 
a 
fear 
and 
anxiety 
of 
which 
she 
did 
not 
understand 
the 
cause. 
She
continually 
fancied 
that 
either 
he 
would 
never 
come 
or 
that 
something
would 
happen 
to 
her 
before 
he

She 
could 
no

think 
of 
him 
by
herself 
calmly

continuously

she 
had 
done 
before.

to

the 
recollection 
of 
the 
old 
prince, 
of 
Princess
Mary, 
of 
the 
theater, 
and 
of 
Kuragin 
mingled 
with 
her 
thoughts. 
The
question 
again 
presented 
itself 
whether 
she 
was<p>
not 
guilty, 
whether 
she
had 
not

The 
news 
that 
the 
Russians 
were 
attacking 
the 
left 
flank 
of 
the 
French
army 
aroused<p>
that 
horror 
in 
Napoleon. 
He 
sat 
silently 
on 
a 
campstool
below 
the 
knoll, 
with 
head 
bowed 
and 
elbows 
on 
his 
knees. 
Berthier
approached 
and 
suggested 
that 
they 
should 
ride 
along 
the 
line 
to
ascertain 
the 
position 
of 
affairs.

"What? 
What 
do 
you 
say?" 
asked 
Napoleon. 
"Yes, 
tell 
them 
to 
bring 
me 
my
horse."

He 
mounted 
and 
rode 
toward 
Semenovsk.

Amid 
the 
powder 
smoke, 
slowly 
dispersing 
over 
the 
whole 
space 
through
which 
Napoleon 
rode, 
horses 
and 
men 
were 
lying 
in 
pools 
of 
blood, 
singly
or 
in 
heaps. 
Neither 
Napoleon 
nor 
any 
of 
his 
generals 
had 
ever 
before
seen 
such 
horrors 
or 
so 
many 
slain 
in 
such 
a 
small 
area. 
The 
roar 
of
guns, 
that 
had 
not 
ceased 
for 
ten 
hours, 
wearied 
the 
ear 
and 
gave
a 
peculiar 
significance 
<a href="/aVzUge/jo8UVJhk1G5oSU.html">to</a> 
the 
spectacle, 
as 
music 
does 
to 
tableaux
vivants. 
Napoleon 
rode 
up 
the 
high 
ground 
at 
Semenovsk, 
and 
through 
the
smoke 
saw 
ranks 
of 
men 
in 
uniforms 
of 
a 
color 
<a href="/cZl/dG51mk.html">unfamiliar</a> 
to 
him. 
They
were 
Russians.

The<p>
Russians 
stood 
in 
serried 
ranks 
behind 
Semenovsk 
village 
and 
its
knoll, 
and 
their 
guns 
boomed 
incessantly 
along 
their 
line 
and 
sent
forth 
clouds 
of 
smoke. 
It 
was 
no 
longer 
a 
battle: 
it 
was 
a 
continuous
slaughter 
which 
could 
be 
of 
no 
avail 
either 
to 
the 
French 
or 
the
Russians. 
Napoleon 
stopped 
his 
horse 
and 
again 
fell 
into 
the 
reverie
from 
which 
Berthier 
had 
aroused 
him. 
He 
could 
not 
stop 
what 
was 
going 
on
before 
him 
and 
around 
him 
and 
was 
supposed 
to<p>
be 
directed 
by 
him 
and 
to
depend 
on 
him, 
and 
from 
its 
lack 
of 
success 
this 
affair, 
for 
the 
first
time, 
seemed 
to 
him 
unnecessary 
and 
horrible.

One 
of 
the 
generals 
rode 
up 
to 
Napoleon 
and 
ventured 
to 
offer 
to 
lead
the 
Old 
Guard 
into 
action. 
Ney 
and 
Berthier, 
standing 
near 
Napoleon,
exchanged 
looks 
and 
smiled 
contemptuously 
at 
this 
general's 
senseless
offer.

Napoleon 
bowed 
his

The
sensation 
of 
those 
terrible 
whistling 
sounds 
and 
of 
the 
corpses<p>
around
him 
merged 
in 
Rostov's 
mind 
into 
a 
single 
feeling 
of 
terror 
and 
pity
for 
himself. 
He 
remembered 
his 
mother's 
last 
letter. 
"What 
would 
she
feel," 
thought 
he, 
"if 
she 
saw 
me 
here 
now 
on 
this 
field 
with

aimed

In 
the 
village<p>
of 
Hosjeradek 
there 
were 
Russian 
troops 
retiring 
from
the 
field 
of 
battle, 
who 
though 
still 
in 
some 
confusion 
were 
less
disordered. 
The 
French 
cannon 
did 
not 
reach 
there 
and 
the 
musketry 
fire
sounded 
far 
away. 
Here 
everyone 
clearly 
saw 
and 
said 
that 
the 
battle
was 
lost. 
No 
one 
whom 
Rostov 
asked 
could 
tell 
him 
where 
the 
Emperor
or 
Kutuzov 
was. 
Some 
said 
the 
report 
that 
the 
Emperor 
was 
wounded 
was
correct, 
others 
that 
it 
was 
not,

Pierre 
straight 
in 
the

"Count

considerable<p>
pause 
which 
made

feel 
uncomfortable.

"Ah, 
Count 
Rostov!" 
exclaimed 
Pierre 
joyfully. 
"Then 
you 
are 
his
son, 
Ilya? 
Only 
fancy, 
I 
didn't 
know 
you 
at 
first. 
Do

how 
we 
went

Sparrow 
Hills 
with 
Madame 
Jacquot?... 
It's 
such 
an
age..."

"You 
are 
mistaken," 
said 
Boris 
deliberately, 
with 
a 
bold 
and
slightly 
sarcastic 
smile. 
"I 
am 
Boris, 
son 
of 
Princess 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
Drubetskaya. 
Rostov, 
the 
father, 
is 
Ilya, 
and 
his 
son 
is
Nicholas. 
I 
never 
knew 
any 
Madame 
Jacquot."

Pierre 
shook 
his 
head 
and 
arms 
as 
if 
attacked 
by 
mosquitoes 
or 
bees.

"Oh 
dear, 
what 
am 
I

about? 
I've 
mixed 
everything 
up. 
One
has 
so 
many 
relatives 
in 
Moscow! 
So 
you 
are 
Boris? 
Of 
course. 
Well, 
now
we 
know 
where 
we 
are. 
And 
what 
do 
you 
think 
of 
the 
Boulogne 
expedition?
The 
English 
will 
come 
off 
badly, 
you 
know, 
if 
Napoleon 
gets 
across 
the
Channel. 
I 
think 
the 
expedition 
is 
quite 
feasible. 
If 
only 
Villeneuve
doesn't 
make 
a 
mess 
of 
things!"

Boris 
knew 
nothing 
about 
the 
Boulogne 
expedition; 
he 
did 
not 
read 
the
papers 
and 
it 
was 
the 
first 
time 
he<p>
had 
heard 
Villeneuve's 
name.

"We 
here 
in 
Moscow 
are 
more 
occupied<p>
with 
dinner 
parties 
and 
scandal
than 
with 
politics," 
said 
he 
in 
his 
quiet 
ironical 
tone. 
"I 
know
nothing 
about 
it 
and 
have 
not 
thought 
about 
it. 
Moscow 
is 
chiefly 
busy
with 
gossip," 
he 
continued. 
"Just 
now 
they 
are 
talking 
about 
you 
and
your 
father."

Pierre 
smiled 
in 
his 
good-natured 
way 
as 
if 
afraid 
for 
his 
companion's
sake 
that 
the 
latter 
might 
say 
something 
he 
would 
afterwards 
regret.
But 
Boris 
spoke 
distinctly, 
clearly, 
and 
dryly, 
looking 
straight 
into
Pierre's 
eyes.

"Moscow 
has 
nothing 
else 
to 
do 
but 
gossip," 
Boris 
went 
on.
"Everybody 
is 
wondering 
to 
whom 
the

will 
leave 
his 
fortune,
though 
he 
may

will..."

"Yes, 
it 
is 
all 
very 
horrid," 
interrupted 
Pierre, 
"very 
horrid."

Pierre 
was 
still 
afraid 
that 
this 
officer 
might 
inadvertently 
say
something 
disconcerting 
to 
himself.

"And 
it 
must 
seem 
to 
you," 
said 
Boris 
flushing 
slightly, 
but 
not
changing 
his 
tone 
or 
attitude, 
"it

CHAPTER 
XIV

After 
receiving 
her 
visitors, 
the 
countess 
was 
so 
tired 
that 
she 
gave
orders 
to 
admit 
no 
more, 
but 
the 
porter 
was 
told 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hp3jM5Y3fY.html">be</a> 
sure 
to 
invite 
to
dinner 
all 
who 
came 
"to

The 
countess 
wished 
to 
have
a 
tete-a-tete 
talk 
with 
the 
friend 
of 
her 
<a href="/aVzUge/HIM9vxtj60IgdEd.html">childhood,</a> 
Princess 
Anna
Mikhaylovna, 
whom 
she 
had 
not 
seen 
properly 
since 
she 
returned 
from
Petersburg. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
with 
her 
tear-worn 
but 
pleasant 
face,
drew 
her 
chair 
nearer 
to 
that 
of 
the 
countess.

"With 
you 
I 
will 
be 
quite 
frank," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna. 
"There
are 
not 
many 
left 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/qQ69oFcgw4PUmnH.html">us</a>

That's 
why 
I 
so 
value 
your
friendship."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
looked 
at 
Vera 
and 
paused. 
The 
countess 
pressed 
her
friend's 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">hand.

"Vera,"</a> 
she<p>
said 
to 
her 
eldest 
daughter 
who 
<a href="/aVzUge/BA7QSaz1alHv5yxsz.html">was</a> 
evidently<p>
not 
a
favorite, 
"how 
is 
it 
you 
have 
so 
little 
tact? 
Don't 
you 
see 
you 
are
not 
wanted 
here? 
Go 
to 
the 
other 
girls, 
or..."

The 
handsome 
Vera 
smiled 
contemptuously 
but 
did 
not 
seem 
at 
all<p>
hurt.

"If 
you 
had 
told 
me 
sooner, 
Mamma, 
I 
would 
have 
gone," 
she 
replied
as 
she 
rose 
to 
go 
to 
her 
own 
room.

But 
as 
she 
passed 
the 
sitting 
room 
she 
noticed 
two 
couples 
sitting,
one 
pair 
at 
each 
window. 
She 
stopped 
and 
smiled 
scornfully. 
Sonya 
was
sitting 
close<p>
to 
Nicholas 
who 
was 
copying 
out 
some 
verses 
for 
her, 
the
first 
he 
had 
ever 
written. 
Boris 
and 
Natasha 
were 
at 
the 
other 
window
and 
ceased 
talking 
when 
Vera 
entered. 
Sonya 
and 
Natasha 
looked 
at
Vera 
with 
guilty, 
happy 
faces.

It 
was 
pleasant 
and 
touching 
to 
see 
these 
little 
girls 
in 
love; 
but

sight

The 
Emperor 
ceased 
speaking, 
the 
crowd 
began 
pressing 
round 
him, 
and
rapturous 
exclamations 
were 
heard 
from 
all 
sides.

"Yes, 
most 
precious... 
a 
royal 
word," 
said 
Count 
Rostov, 
with 
a 
sob. 
He
stood 
at 
the 
back, 
and, 
though 
he 
had 
heard 
hardly 
anything, 
understood
everything 
in 
his 
own 
way.

From 
the 
hall 
of 
the 
nobility 
the 
Emperor 
went 
to 
that 
of 
the 
merchants.
There 
he 
remained 
about 
ten 
minutes. 
Pierre 
was 
among 
those 
who 
saw 
him
come 
out 
from 
the 
merchants' 
hall 
with 
tears 
of 
emotion 
in 
his 
eyes.
As 
became 
known 
later, 
he 
had 
scarcely 
begun 
to 
address 
the 
merchants
before 
tears 
gushed 
from 
his<p>
eyes 
and 
he 
concluded 
in 
a 
trembling
voice. 
When 
Pierre 
saw 
the 
Emperor 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xa2t8Cv2U.html">he</a> 
was 
coming 
out 
accompanied 
by 
two
merchants, 
one 
of 
whom 
Pierre 
knew, 
a 
fat 
otkupshchik. 
The 
other 
was
the 
mayor, 
a 
man 
with 
a 
thin 
sallow 
face<p>
and 
narrow 
beard. 
Both 
were
weeping. 
Tears 
filled 
the 
thin 
man's 
eyes, 
and 
the 
fat 
otkupshchik
sobbed 
outright 
like 
a 
child 
and 
kept 
repeating:

"Our 
lives 
and 
property-take 
them, 
Your 
Majesty!"

Pierre's 
one 
feeling 
at 
the 
moment 
was 
a 
desire 
to 
show 
that 
he 
was
ready 
to 
go 
all 
lengths 
and 
was 
prepared 
to 
sacrifice 
everything. 
He 
now
felt 
ashamed 
of 
his 
speech 
with 
its 
constitutional 
tendency 
and 
sought
an 
opportunity 
of 
effacing 
it. 
Having 
heard 
that 
Count 
Mamonov 
was
furnishing 
a 
regiment, 
Bezukhov 
at 
once 
informed<p>
Rostopchin 
that 
he
would 
give 
a 
thousand 
men 
and 
their 
maintenance.

Old 
Rostov 
could 
not 
tell 
his 
wife 
of 
what 
had 
passed 
without 
tears, 
and
at 
once 
consented 
to 
Petya's 
request 
and 
went 
himself 
to 
enter 
his 
name.

Next 
day 
the 
Emperor 
left 
Moscow. 
The 
assembled 
nobles 
all 
took 
off
their 
uniforms 
and 
settled 
down 
again 
in 
their 
homes 
and 
clubs, 
and 
not
without 
some 
groans 
gave 
orders 
to 
their 
stewards 
about 
the 
enrollment,
feeling 
amazed 
themselves 
at 
what 
they 
had 
done.

Rostov

a 
very
important

"Come,

The

wife 
led 
him 
up

tall 
and 
very 
stout 
old 
lady 
with
a 
blue 
headdress, 
who 
had 
just 
finished 
her 
game 
of 
cards 
with 
the 
most
important 
personages 
of 
the 
town. 
This 
was 
Malvintseva, 
Princess 
Mary's
aunt 
on 
her 
mother's 
side, 
a 
rich, 
childless 
widow 
who 
always 
lived 
in
Voronezh. 
When 
Rostov 
approached 
her 
she 
was 
standing 
settling 
up 
for
the 
game. 
She 
looked 
at 
him 
and, 
screwing 
up 
her 
eyes 
sternly, 
continued
to 
upbraid 
the 
general 
who 
had 
won 
from 
her.

"Very 
pleased, 
mon 
cher," 
she 
then 
said, 
holding 
out 
her<p>
hand 
to
Nicholas. 
"Pray 
come 
and 
see 
me."

After 
a 
few 
words 
about 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
her 
late 
father, 
whom
Malvintseva 
had 
evidently 
not 
liked, 
and 
having 
asked 
what 
Nicholas
knew 
of 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
also 
was 
evidently 
no 
favorite 
of 
hers, 
the
important 
old 
lady 
dismissed 
Nicholas 
after 
repeating 
her 
invitation 
to
come 
to 
see 
her.

Nicholas 
promised 
to 
come 
and 
blushed 
again 
as 
he 
bowed. 
At 
the 
mention
of 
Princess 
Mary 
he 
experienced 
a 
feeling 
of 
shyness 
and 
even 
<a href="/aVzUge/WD9fOHvf2Wu9.html">of</a> 
fear,
which 
he 
himself 
did 
not

When 
he

parted 
from 
Malvintseva 
Nicholas 
wished 
to 
return 
to 
the
dancing, 
but 
the

placed 
her 
plump

on 
his

saying 
that 
she 
wanted 
to

him

from 
which 
those 
who 
were

withdrew
so 
as 
not

"Do

began 
the

the

of

<a href="/cZl/oz7EXJo37NPT.html">guided</a> 
his 
decisions 
merely 
gave 
them 
his 
final
conclusions 
in 
the 
form 
of 
commands. 
Having 
listened 
to 
a 
suggestion
from 
Davout, 
who 
was 
now 
called 
Prince 
d'Eckmuehl, 
to 
turn 
the 
Russian
left 
<a href="/aVzUge/LE260zSr.html">wing,</a> 
Napoleon 
said 
it 
should 
not 
be 
done, 
without 
explaining
why 
not. 
To 
a 
proposal 
made 
by 
General 
Campan 
(who 
was 
to 
attack 
the
fleches) 
to 
lead 
his 
division 
through 
the 
woods, 
Napoleon 
agreed, 
though
the 
so-called 
Duke 
of 
Elchingen 
(Ney) 
ventured 
to 
remark 
that 
a 
movement
through 
the 
woods 
was 
dangerous 
and 
might 
disorder 
the 
division.

Having 
inspected 
the 
country 
opposite 
the 
Shevardino 
Redoubt, 
Napoleon
pondered 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hI3tc2BnCGW3iLv.html">a</a> 
little 
in 
silence 
and 
then 
indicated 
the 
spots 
where 
two
batteries 
should 
be 
set 
up 
by 
the 
morrow 
to 
act 
against 
the 
Russian
entrenchments, 
and 
the 
places 
where, 
in 
line 
with 
them, 
the 
field
artillery 
should 
be 
placed.

After 
giving 
these 
and 
other 
commands 
he 
returned 
to 
his 
tent, 
and 
the
dispositions 
for 
the 
battle 
were 
written 
down 
from 
his 
dictation.

These 
dispositions, 
of 
which 
the 
French 
historians 
write 
with 
enthusiasm
and 
other 
historians 
with 
profound 
respect, 
were 
as 
follows:

At 
dawn 
the 
two 
new 
batteries 
established 
during 
the 
night 
on 
the
plain 
occupied 
by 
the 
Prince 
d'Eckmuehl

open 
fire

made 
the

It

dark. 
The

and 
breakfasting, 
the

munching 
biscuit 
and 
beating 
a

and 
everything 
that 
they
did 
not 
want 
or 
could 
not

away 
with

Austrian 
column 
guides
were 
moving 
in 
and 
out 
among 
the 
Russian 
troops 
and 
served 
as 
heralds
of 
the 
advance. 
As 
soon 
as 
an 
Austrian 
officer 
showed 
himself 
near
a 
commanding 
officer's 
quarters, 
the 
regiment 
began 
to 
move: 
the
soldiers 
ran 
from 
the 
fires, 
thrust 
their 
pipes 
into 
their 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">boots,</a> 
their
bags 
into 
the 
carts, 
got 
their 
muskets 
ready, 
and 
formed 
rank. 
The
officers 
buttoned 
up 
their 
coats, 
buckled 
on 
their 
swords 
and 
pouches,
and 
moved 
along 
the 
ranks 
shouting. 
The 
train 
drivers 
and 
orderlies
harnessed 
and 
packed 
the 
wagons 
and 
tied 
on 
the 
loads. 
The 
adjutants 
and
battalion 
and 
regimental 
commanders 
mounted, 
crossed 
themselves, 
gave
final 
instructions, 
orders, 
and 
commissions 
to 
the 
baggage 
men
who 
remained 
behind, 
and 
the 
monotonous 
tramp 
of 
thousands 
of 
feet
resounded. 
The 
column 
moved 
forward 
without 
knowing 
where 
and 
unable,
from 
the 
masses 
around 
them, 
the 
smoke 
and 
the 
increasing 
fog, 
to 
see
either 
the 
place 
they 
were 
leaving 
or 
that 
to 
which 
they 
were 
going.

A 
soldier 
on 
the 
march 
is 
hemmed 
in 
and 
borne 
along 
by 
his 
regiment 
as
much 
as 
a 
sailor 
is 
by 
his 
ship. 
However 
far 
he 
has 
walked, 
whatever
strange, 
unknown, 
and 
dangerous 
places 
he 
reaches, 
just 
as 
a 
sailor 
is
always 
surrounded 
by 
the 
same 
decks, 
masts, 
and 
rigging 
of 
his 
ship, 
so
the 
soldier 
always 
has 
around 
him 
the 
same 
comrades, 
the 
same 
ranks, 
the
same 
sergeant 
major 
Ivan 
Mitrich, 
the 
same 
company 
dog 
Jack, 
and 
the
same<p>
commanders. 
The 
sailor 
rarely 
cares 
to 
know 
the 
latitude 
in 
which
his 
ship 
is 
sailing, 
but 
on 
the 
day 
of 
battle-heaven 
knows 
how 
and
whence-a 
stern 
note 
of 
which 
all 
are 
conscious 
sounds 
in 
the 
moral
atmosphere 
of 
an 
army, 
announcing 
the 
approach 
of 
something 
decisive
and 
solemn, 
and 
awakening 
in 
the 
men 
an 
unusual 
curiosity. 
On 
the 
day 
of
battle 
the 
soldiers 
excitedly 
try 
to 
get 
beyond 
the 
interests<p>
of 
their
regiment, 
they 
listen 
intently, 
look 
about, 
and 
eagerly 
ask 
concerning
what 
is 
going 
on 
around 
them.

The 
fog 
had 
grown 
so 
dense 
that 
though 
it 
was 
growing 
light 
they 
could
not 
see 
ten 
paces 
ahead. 
Bushes 
looked 
like 
gigantic 
trees 
and 
level
ground 
like 
cliffs 
and 
slopes. 
Anywhere, 
on 
any 
side, 
one 
might
encounter 
an 
enemy 
invisible 
ten 
paces 
off. 
But 
the 
columns 
advanced
for 
a 
long 
time, 
always 
in 
the 
same 
fog, 
descending 
and 
ascending 
hills,
avoiding 
gardens 
and 
enclosures, 
going 
over 
new 
and 
unknown 
ground, 
and
nowhere 
encountering 
the 
enemy. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
soldiers 
became
aware 
that<p>
in 
front, 
behind, 
and 
on 
all 
sides, 
other 
Russian 
columns
were 
moving 
in 
the 
same 
direction. 
Every 
soldier 
felt 
glad 
to 
know 
that
to 
the 
unknown 
place 
where 
he 
was 
going, 
many 
more 
of 
our 
men 
were 
going
too.

"There 
now, 
the 
Kurskies 
have 
also 
gone 
past," 
was 
being 
said 
in
the 
ranks.

"It's

A 
third 
class 
of 
historians-the 
so-called 
historians 
of
culture-following 
the 
path 
laid 
down 
by 
the 
<a href="/cZl/al5bOIDr0VWVhi1U.html">universal</a> 
historians 
who
sometimes 
accept 
writers 
and 
ladies 
as 
forces 
producing 
events-again
take 
that 
force 
to 
be 
something 
quite 
different. 
They 
see 
it 
in 
what 
is
called 
culture-in 
mental 
activity.

The 
historians 
of 
culture 
are 
quite 
consistent 
in 
regard 
to 
their
progenitors, 
the 
writers 
of 
universal 
histories, 
for 
if 
historical
events 
may 
be 
explained 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
certain 
persons 
treated 
one
another 
in 
such 
and 
such 
ways, 
why 
not<p>
explain 
them 
by 
the 
fact 
that
such 
and 
such 
people 
wrote 
such 
and 
such 
books? 
Of 
the 
immense 
number 
of
indications 
accompanying 
every 
vital 
phenomenon, 
these 
historians 
select
the 
indication 
of 
intellectual 
activity 
and 
say 
that 
this 
indication 
is
the 
cause. 
But 
despite 
their 
endeavors 
to 
prove 
that 
the 
cause 
of 
events
lies 
in 
intellectual 
activity, 
only 
by 
a 
great 
stretch 
can 
one 
admit
that 
there 
is 
any 
connection 
between 
intellectual 
activity 
and 
the
movement

the 
life</h1>of 
a 
society 
woman 
when 
she 
feels
that 
her 
last 
chance 
of 
marrying 
has 
come 
and 
that 
her 
fate 
must 
be
decided 
now 
or 
never. 
On 
Thursdays 
Princess 
Mary 
remembered 
with 
a
mournful 
smile 
that 
she 
now 
had 
no 
one 
to 
write 
to, 
since 
Julie-whose
presence 
gave 
her 
no 
pleasure 
was 
here 
and 
they 
met 
every 
week. 
Like 
the
old 
emigre 
who 
declined 
to 
marry 
the 
lady 
with 
whom 
he 
had 
spent 
his
evenings 
for 
years, 
she 
regretted 
Julie's 
presence 
and 
having 
no 
one
to 
write 
to. 
In 
Moscow 
Princess 
Mary 
had 
no 
one 
to 
talk 
to, 
no 
one 
to
whom 
to 
confide 
her 
sorrow, 
and 
much 
sorrow 
fell 
to 
her 
lot 
just 
then.
The 
time 
for 
Prince 
Andrew's 
return 
and 
marriage 
was 
approaching, 
but
his 
request 
to 
her 
to 
prepare 
his 
father 
for 
it 
had 
not 
been 
carried
out; 
in 
fact, 
it 
seemed 
as 
if 
matters 
were 
quite 
hopeless, 
for 
at 
every
mention 
of 
the 
young 
Countess 
Rostova 
the 
old 
prince 
(who 
apart 
from
that 
was 
usually 
in 
a 
bad 
temper) 
lost 
control 
of 
himself. 
Another
lately 
added 
sorrow 
arose 
from 
the 
lessons 
she 
gave 
her 
six 
year-old
nephew. 
To 
her 
consternation 
she 
detected 
in 
herself 
in 
relation 
to
little 
Nicholas 
some 
symptoms 
of 
her 
father's 
irritability. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Er7trTR5ODiFp2ZR.html">However
often</a> 
she 
told 
herself 
that 
she 
must

almost 
every 
time 
that,

she 
sat

her 
own 
knowledge 
quickly
and 
easily 
into 
the 
child-who 
was 
already 
afraid 
that 
Auntie 
might 
at
any 
moment 
get 
angry-that 
at 
his 
slightest 
inattention 
she 
trembled,
became 
flustered 
and 
heated, 
raised 
her 
voice, 
and 
sometimes 
pulled 
him
by 
the 
arm 
and 
put 
him 
in 
the 
corner. 
Having 
put 
him 
in 
the 
corner
she 
would 
herself 
begin 
to 
cry 
over 
her 
cruel, 
evil 
nature, 
and 
little
Nicholas, 
following 
her 
example, 
would 
sob, 
and 
without 
permission 
would
leave 
his 
corner, 
come 
to 
her, 
pull 
her 
wet<p>
hands 
from 
her 
face, 
and
comfort 
her. 
But 
what 
distressed 
the 
princess 
most 
of 
all 
was 
her
father's 
irritability, 
which 
was 
always 
directed 
against 
her 
and 
had
of 
late 
amounted 
to 
cruelty. 
Had 
he 
forced 
her 
to 
prostrate 
herself 
to
the 
ground 
all 
night, 
had 
he 
beaten 
her 
or 
made 
her 
fetch 
wood 
or 
water,
it 
would 
never 
have 
entered 
her 
mind 
to 
think 
her 
position 
hard; 
but
this 
loving 
despot-the 
more 
cruel 
because 
he 
loved 
her 
and 
for 
that
reason 
tormented 
himself 
and 
her-knew 
how 
not 
merely 
to 
hurt 
and
humiliate 
her 
deliberately, 
but 
to 
show 
her 
that 
she<p>
was 
always 
to 
blame
for 
everything.

CHAPTER 
XXVII

At 
the 
appointed 
hour 
the 
prince, 
powdered 
and 
shaven, 
entered 
the
dining 
room 
where 
his 
daughter-in-law, 
Princess 
Mary, 
and 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne 
were 
already 
awaiting 
him 
together 
with 
his 
architect, 
who 
by
a 
strange 
caprice 
of 
his 
employer's 
was 
admitted 
to 
table 
though 
the
position 
of 
that 
insignificant 
individual 
was 
such 
as 
could 
certainly
not 
have 
caused 
him 
to 
expect 
that 
honor. 
The 
prince, 
who 
generally 
kept
very 
strictly 
to 
social 
distinctions 
and 
rarely 
admitted 
even 
important
government 
officials 
to 
his 
table, 
had 
unexpectedly 
selected 
Michael
Ivanovich 
(who 
always 
went 
into 
a 
corner 
to 
blow 
his 
nose 
on 
his
checked 
handkerchief) 
to<p>
illustrate 
the 
theory 
that 
all<p>
men 
are 
equals,
and 
had 
more 
than 
once 
impressed 
on 
his 
daughter 
that<p>
Michael 
Ivanovich
was 
"not 
a 
whit 
worse 
than 
you 
or 
I." 
At 
dinner 
the 
prince 
usually
spoke 
to 
the 
taciturn 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
more 
often 
than 
to 
anyone 
else.

In 
the 
dining 
room, 
which 
like 
all 
the 
rooms 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/Lu1l51UVJhk.html">the</a> 
house 
was
exceedingly 
lofty, 
the 
members 
of 
the 
household 
and 
the 
footmen-one
behind 
each 
chair-stood 
waiting 
for 
the 
prince 
to 
enter. 
The 
head
butler, 
napkin 
on 
arm, 
was 
scanning 
the 
setting 
of 
the 
table, 
making
signs 
to 
the 
footmen, 
and 
anxiously 
glancing 
from 
the 
clock 
to 
the 
door
by 
which 
the 
prince 
was 
to 
enter. 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
looking 
at 
a 
large
gilt 
frame, 
new 
to 
him, 
containing 
the 
genealogical 
tree 
of 
the 
Princes
Bolkonski, 
opposite 
which 
hung 
another 
such 
frame 
with 
a 
badly 
painted
portrait 
(evidently 
by 
the 
hand 
of 
the 
artist 
belonging 
to 
the 
estate)
of 
a 
ruling 
prince, 
in 
a 
crown-an 
alleged 
descendant 
of 
Rurik 
<a href="/cZl/Ri5U63U.html">and
ancestor</a> 
of 
the 
Bolkonskis. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
again 
at 
that
genealogical 
tree, 
shook 
his 
head, 
laughing 
as 
a 
man 
laughs 
who 
looks 
at
a 
portrait 
so 
characteristic 
of 
the 
original 
as 
to 
be 
amusing.

"How 
thoroughly 
like 
him 
that 
is!" 
he 
said 
to 
Princess 
Mary, 
who 
had
come 
up 
to 
him.

Princess 
Mary 
looked 
at 
her 
brother 
in 
surprise. 
She 
did 
not 
understand
what 
he 
was 
laughing 
at. 
Everything 
her 
father 
did 
inspired 
her 
with
reverence 
and 
was 
beyond 
question.

"Everyone 
has 
his 
Achilles' 
heel," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew.
"Fancy, 
with 
his 
powerful 
mind, 
indulging 
in 
such 
nonsense!"

Princess 
Mary 
could 
not 
understand 
the 
boldness 
of 
her 
brother's
criticism 
and 
was 
about 
to 
reply, 
when 
the 
expected 
footsteps 
were 
heard
coming 
from 
the 
study. 
The 
prince 
walked 
in 
quickly 
and 
jauntily 
as 
was
his 
wont, 
as 
if 
intentionally 
contrasting 
the 
briskness 
of 
his 
manners
with 
the 
strict 
formality 
of 
his 
house. 
At 
that 
moment 
the 
great 
clock
struck 
two 
and 
another 
with 
a

CHAPTER 
V

The 
<a href="/cZl/ONG9qQqw3Mm6.html">rain</a> 
had 
stopped, 
and 
only 
the 
mist 
was 
falling 
and 
drops 
from
the 
trees. 
Denisov, 
the 
esaul, 
and 
Petya 
rode 
silently, 
following 
the
peasant 
in 
the 
knitted 
cap 
who, 
stepping 
lightly 
with 
outturned 
toes
and 
moving 
noiselessly 
in 
his 
bast 
shoes 
over 
the 
roots 
and 
wet 
leaves,
silently 
led 
<a href="/aVzUge/nI91hOZs9om.html">them</a> 
to 
the 
edge 
of 
the 
forest.

He 
ascended 
an 
incline, 
stopped, 
looked 
about 
him, 
and 
advanced 
to 
where
the 
screen 
of<p>
trees 
was 
less 
dense. 
On 
reaching 
a 
large 
oak 
tree 
that
had 
not 
yet 
shed 
its 
leaves, 
he 
stopped 
and 
beckoned 
mysteriously 
to
them 
with 
his 
hand.

Denisov 
and 
Petya 
rode 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ce16rq6TtfY.html">up</a> 
to 
him. 
From 
the 
spot 
where 
the 
peasant 
was
standing 
they 
could 
see 
the 
French. 
Immediately 
beyond 
the 
forest, 
on 
a
downward 
slope, 
lay 
a 
field 
of 
spring 
rye. 
To 
the 
right, 
beyond 
a 
steep
ravine, 
was 
a 
small 
village 
and 
a 
landowner's 
house 
with 
a 
broken 
roof.
In 
the

in

in

by

jump 
up 
and 
run 
to 
fulfill 
it.

The 
entire 
household 
was 
governed 
according 
to 
Pierre's 
supposed 
orders,
that 
is, 
by 
his 
wishes 
which 
Natasha 
tried 
to 
guess. 
Their<p>
way 
of
life 
and 
place 
of 
residence, 
<a href="/cZl/rJ9U3bXmQ1hQrxS.html">their</a> 
acquaintances 
and 
ties, 
Natasha's
occupations, 
the 
children's 
upbringing, 
were 
all 
selected 
not 
merely
with 
regard<p>
to 
Pierre's 
expressed 
wishes, 
but 
to 
what 
Natasha 
from 
the
thoughts 
he 
expressed 
in 
conversation 
supposed 
his 
wishes 
to 
be. 
And 
she
deduced 
the 
essentials 
of 
his 
wishes 
quite<p>
correctly, 
and 
having 
once
arrived 
at 
them 
clung 
to 
them 
tenaciously. 
When 
Pierre 
himself 
wanted 
to
change 
his 
mind 
she 
would 
fight 
him 
with 
his 
own 
weapons.

Thus 
in 
a 
time 
of 
trouble 
ever 
memorable 
to 
him 
after 
the 
birth 
of 
their
first 
child 
who 
was 
delicate, 
when 
they 
had 
to 
change 
the 
wet 
nurse
three 
times 
and 
Natasha 
fell 
ill 
from 
despair, 
Pierre 
one 
day 
told 
her
of 
Rousseau's 
view, 
with 
which 
he 
quite 
agreed, 
that 
to 
have 
a 
wet
nurse 
is 
unnatural 
and 
harmful. 
When 
her 
next 
baby 
was 
born, 
despite
the 
opposition 
of 
her 
<a href="/cZl/rP5vE4Gj3M.html">mother,</a> 
the 
doctors, 
and 
even 
of 
her 
husband
himself-who 
were 
all 
vigorously 
opposed 
to 
her 
nursing 
her 
baby 
herself,
a 
thing 
then 
unheard 
of 
and 
considered<p>
injurious-she 
insisted 
on 
having
her 
own 
way, 
and 
after 
that 
nursed 
all 
her 
babies 
herself.

It 
very 
often 
happened 
that 
in 
a 
moment 
of 
irritation 
husband 
and 
wife
would 
have 
a 
dispute, 
but 
long 
afterwards 
Pierre 
to 
his 
surprise 
and
delight 
would 
find 
in 
his 
wife's 
ideas 
and 
actions 
the 
very 
thought
against 
which 
she 
had 
argued, 
but 
divested 
of 
everything 
superfluous
that 
in 
the 
excitement 
of 
the 
dispute 
he 
had 
added 
when 
expressing 
his
opinion.

After 
seven 
years 
of 
marriage 
Pierre 
had 
the 
joyous 
and 
firm
consciousness 
that 
he 
was 
not 
a 
bad 
man, 
and 
he 
felt 
this 
because 
he 
saw
himself 
reflected 
in 
his 
wife. 
He 
felt 
the 
good 
and 
bad 
within 
himself
inextricably 
mingled 
and 
overlapping. 
But 
only 
what 
was 
really 
good 
in
him 
was 
reflected 
in 
his 
wife, 
all 
that 
was 
not 
quite 
good 
was 
rejected.
And 
this 
was 
not 
the 
result 
of 
logical 
reasoning

CHAPTER 
XI

Two 
months 
previously 
when 
Pierre 
was 
already 
staying 
with 
the 
Rostovs
he 
had 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Prince 
Theodore, 
asking 
him 
to 
come
to 
Petersburg 
to 
confer 
<a href="/cZl/tj7oGGl9PsUhP6ohMq.html">on</a> 
some 
important 
questions 
that 
were 
being
discussed 
there 
by 
a 
society 
of 
which 
Pierre 
was 
one<p>
of 
the 
principal
founders.

On 
reading 
that 
letter 
(she 
always 
read 
her 
husband's 
letters) 
Natasha
herself 
suggested 
that 
<a href="/aVzUge/zl36Jk9rP.html">he</a> 
should 
go 
to 
Petersburg, 
though 
she 
would 
feel
his 
absence 
very 
acutely. 
She 
attributed 
immense 
importance 
to 
all
her 
husband's 
intellectual 
and 
abstract 
interests 
though 
she 
did 
not
understand 
them, 
and 
she 
always 
dreaded 
being 
a 
hindrance 
to 
him 
in 
such
matters. 
To 
Pierre's 
timid 
look 
of<p>
inquiry 
after 
reading 
the 
letter 
she
replied 
by 
asking 
him 
to 
go, 
but 
to 
fix 
a 
definite 
date 
for 
his 
return.
He 
was 
given 
four 
weeks' 
leave 
of 
absence.

Ever 
since 
that 
leave 
of 
absence 
had 
expired, 
more 
than 
a 
fortnight
before,

an

Almost

black 
fields 
and

had
become 
golden 
and 
bright-red 
islands 
amid 
the 
green 
winter

The
hares 
had 
already 
half 
changed 
their

coats, 
the 
fox 
cubs 
were
beginning 
to 
scatter, 
and 
the 
young 
wolves 
were 
bigger 
than 
dogs. 
It 
was
the 
best 
time 
of 
the 
year 
for 
the 
chase. 
The 
hounds 
of 
that 
<a href="/aVzUge/hQ6STxex23.html">ardent</a> 
young
sportsman 
Rostov 
had 
not 
merely 
reached 
hard 
winter 
condition, 
but 
were
so 
jaded 
that 
at 
a 
meeting 
of 
the 
huntsmen 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
give 
them
a 
three 
days' 
rest 
and 
then, 
on 
the 
sixteenth 
of<p>
September, 
to 
go 
on
a 
distant 
expedition, 
starting 
from 
the 
oak 
grove 
where 
there 
was 
an
undisturbed 
litter 
of 
wolf 
cubs.

All 
that 
day 
the 
hounds 
remained 
at 
home. 
It 
was 
frosty 
and 
the 
air 
was
sharp, 
but 
toward 
evening 
the 
sky 
became 
overcast 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cm8wNlRn9CpNdk5.html">and</a> 
it 
began 
to 
thaw.
On 
the 
fifteenth, 
when 
young 
Rostov, 
in 
his 
dressing 
gown, 
looked 
out
of 
the 
window, 
he 
saw 
it 
was 
an 
unsurpassable 
morning 
for 
hunting: 
it
was 
as 
if 
the 
sky 
were 
melting 
and 
sinking 
to 
the 
earth 
without 
any
wind. 
The 
only 
motion 
in 
the 
air 
was 
that 
of 
the 
dripping, 
microscopic
particles 
of 
drizzling 
mist. 
The 
bare 
twigs 
in 
the 
garden 
were 
hung 
with
transparent 
drops 
which 
fell 
on 
the 
freshly 
fallen 
leaves. 
The 
earth 
in
the 
kitchen 
garden 
looked 
wet 
and 
black 
and 
glistened 
like 
poppy 
seed
and 
at 
a 
short 
distance 
merged 
into 
the 
dull, 
moist 
veil 
of 
mist.
Nicholas 
went 
out 
into 
the 
wet 
and 
muddy 
porch. 
There 
was 
a 
smell 
of
decaying 
leaves 
and 
of 
dog. 
Milka, 
a 
black-spotted, 
broad-haunched
bitch 
with 
prominent 
black 
eyes, 
got 
up 
on 
seeing 
her 
master, 
stretched
her 
hind 
legs, 
lay 
down 
like 
a 
hare, 
and 
then 
suddenly 
jumped 
up 
and
licked 
him 
right 
on 
his 
nose 
and 
mustache. 
Another 
borzoi, 
a 
dog,
catching 
sight 
of 
his 
master 
from 
the 
garden 
path, 
arched 
his 
back
and, 
rushing 
headlong 
toward 
the 
porch 
with 
lifted 
tail, 
began 
rubbing
himself 
against 
his 
legs.

"O-hoy!" 
came 
at 
that 
moment, 
that 
inimitable 
huntsman's 
call
which 
unites 
the 
deepest 
bass 
with 
the 
shrillest 
tenor, 
and 
round
the 
corner 
came 
Daniel 
the 
head 
huntsman 
and 
head 
kennelman, 
a 
gray,
wrinkled 
old 
man 
with 
hair 
cut 
straight 
over 
his 
forehead, 
Ukrainian
fashion, 
a 
long 
bent 
whip 
in 
his 
hand, 
and 
that 
look 
of 
independence
and 
scorn 
of 
everything 
that 
is 
only 
seen 
in 
huntsmen. 
He 
doffed 
his
Circassian 
cap 
to 
his 
master 
and 
looked 
at 
him 
scornfully. 
This 
scorn

sound 
men 
made 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Hi3AF3G4KqZP.html">as</a> 
they 
crossed 
themselves 
were 
heard.

The 
crowd 
round 
the 
icon 
suddenly 
parted 
and 
pressed 
against 
Pierre.
Someone, 
a 
very 
important 
personage 
judging 
by 
the 
haste 
with 
which 
way
was 
made 
for 
him, 
was 
approaching 
the 
icon.

It 
was 
Kutuzov, 
who 
had 
been 
riding 
round 
the 
position 
and 
on 
his 
way
back 
to 
Tatarinova 
had 
stopped 
where 
the 
service 
was 
being 
held. 
Pierre
recognized 
him 
at 
once 
by 
his 
peculiar 
figure, 
which 
distinguished 
him
from 
everybody 
else.

With 
a 
long 
overcoat 
on 
his 
exceedingly 
stout, 
round-shouldered 
body,
with 
uncovered 
white 
head 
and 
puffy 
face 
showing 
the 
white 
ball 
of 
the
eye 
he 
had 
lost,<p>
Kutuzov 
walked 
with 
plunging, 
swaying 
gait 
into
the 
crowd 
and 
stopped 
behind 
the 
priest. 
He 
crossed 
himself 
with 
an
accustomed 
movement, 
bent 
till 
he 
touched 
the 
ground 
with 
his 
hand, 
and
bowed 
his 
white 
head 
with 
a 
deep 
sigh. 
Behind 
Kutuzov 
was 
Bennigsen 
and
the 
suite. 
Despite 
the 
presence 
of 
the 
commander

chief, 
who 
attracted

of 
all 
the 
superior 
officers, 
the

without 
looking 
at 
him.

not

whom 
to 
answer, 
looked 
at 
them 
all 
and 
smiled. 
His
smile 
was 
unlike 
the 
half-smile 
of 
other 
people. 
When 
he 
smiled,
his 
grave, 
even 
rather 
gloomy,

was 
instantaneously 
replaced 
by
another-a 
childlike, 
kindly, 
even 
rather 
silly 
look, 
which 
seemed 
to
ask 
forgiveness.

The 
vicomte 
who 
was 
meeting 
him 
for 
the 
first 
time 
saw 
clearly 
that
this 
young 
Jacobin 
was 
not 
so 
terrible 
as 
his 
words 
suggested. 
All 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cf1m55yf.html">were
silent.

"How</a> 
do<p>

expect 
him 
to 
answer

at

said<p>
Prince
Andrew. 
"Besides,

person, 
as 
a

and 
as 
an

So 
it 
seems 
to 
me."

"Yes, 
yes,

course!" 
Pierre 
chimed 
in, 
pleased 
at 
the 
arrival 
of
this 
reinforcement.

"One 
must 
admit," 
continued 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"that 
Napoleon 
as 
a 
man
was 
great 
on 
the 
bridge 
of 
Arcola, 
and 
in

at 
Jaffa 
where 
he
gave 
his 
hand 
to 
the 
plague-stricken; 
but 
... 
but 
there 
are 
other 
acts
which 
it 
is 
difficult 
to

Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
had 
evidently 
wished 
to 
tone 
down 
the 
awkwardness 
of
Pierre's 
remarks, 
rose 
and 
made 
a 
sign 
to 
his 
wife 
that 
it 
was 
time 
to
go.

Suddenly 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
started 
up 
making 
signs 
to 
everyone 
to 
attend,
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/CE6QD8yG5z.html">asking</a> 
them 
all 
to 
be 
seated 
began:

"I 
was

a 
charming 
Moscow 
story 
today 
and 
must 
treat 
you 
to 
it.
Excuse 
me, 
Vicomte-I 
must 
tell 
it 
in 
Russian 
or 
the 
point

And 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
began 
to 
tell 
his 
story 
in 
such 
Russian
as 
a 
Frenchman 
would 
speak 
after 
spending 
about 
a 
year 
in 
Russia.
Everyone 
waited, 
so 
emphatically 
and 
eagerly 
did 
he 
demand 
their
attention 
to 
his 
story.

"There 
is 
in 
Moscow 
a 
lady, 
une 
dame, 
and 
she 
is 
very 
stingy. 
She 
must
have 
two 
footmen 
behind 
her 
carriage, 
and 
very 
big 
ones.<p>
That 
was 
her
taste. 
And 
she 
had 
a 
lady's 
maid, 
also 
big. 
She 
said...."

Here 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
paused, 
evidently 
collecting 
his 
ideas 
with
difficulty.

"She 
said.... 
Oh 
yes! 
She 
said, 
'Girl,' 
to 
the 
maid, 
'put 
on 
a
livery, 
get 
up 
behind 
the 
carriage, 
and 
come 
with 
me 
while 
I 
make 
some
calls.'"

Here 
Prince 
Hippolyte 
spluttered 
and 
burst 
out 
laughing 
long 
before 
his
audience, 
which 
produced 
an 
effect 
unfavorable 
to 
the 
narrator. 
Several
persons, 
among 
them 
the 
elderly 
lady 
and 
Anna 
Pavlovna, 
did 
however
smile.

"She 
went. 
Suddenly 
there 
was 
a 
great 
wind. 
The 
girl 
lost 
her 
hat 
and
her 
long 
hair 
came 
down...." 
Here 
he 
could 
contain 
himself 
no
longer 
and 
went 
on, 
between 
gasps 
of 
laughter: 
"And 
the 
whole 
world
knew...."

And 
so 
the 
anecdote 
ended. 
Though 
it 
was 
unintelligible 
why 
he 
had 
told
it, 
or 
why 
it 
had 
to 
be 
told 
in 
Russian, 
still 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
and 
the
others 
appreciated 
Prince 
Hippolyte's 
social 
tact 
in 
so

"That's 
a 
fine 
death!" 
said 
Napoleon 
as 
he 
gazed 
at 
Bolkonski.

Prince 
Andrew 
understood 
that 
this 
was 
said 
of 
him 
and 
that 
it 
was
Napoleon 
who 
said 
it. 
He 
heard 
the 
speaker 
addressed 
as 
Sire. 
But 
he
heard 
the 
words 
as 
he 
might 
have 
heard 
the 
buzzing 
of 
a 
fly. 
Not 
only
did 
they 
not 
interest 
him, 
but 
he 
took 
no 
notice 
of 
them 
and 
at 
once
forgot 
them. 
His 
head 
was 
burning, 
he 
felt 
himself 
bleeding 
to 
death,
and 
he 
saw 
above 
<a href="/aVzUge/kH5ieWTn1Qc1on.html">him</a> 
the 
remote, 
lofty, 
and 
everlasting 
sky. 
He 
knew 
it
was 
Napoleon-his 
hero-but 
at 
that 
moment 
Napoleon 
seemed 
to 
him
such 
a 
small, 
insignificant 
creature 
compared 
with 
what 
was 
passing 
now
between 
himself 
and 
that 
lofty 
infinite 
sky 
with 
the 
clouds 
flying 
over
it. 
At 
that 
moment 
it 
meant 
nothing 
to 
him 
who 
might 
be 
standing 
over
him, 
or 
what 
was 
said 
of 
him; 
he 
was 
only 
glad 
that 
people 
were 
standing
near 
him<p>
and 
only 
wished 
that 
they 
would 
help 
him 
and 
bring 
him 
back 
to
life, 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
so 
beautiful 
now 
that 
he 
had 
today 
learned 
to
understand 
it 
so 
differently. 
He 
collected 
all 
his 
strength, 
to 
stir 
and
utter 
a 
sound. 
He 
feebly 
moved 
his 
leg 
and 
uttered 
a 
weak, 
sickly 
groan
which 
aroused 
his 
own 
pity.

"Ah! 
He 
is 
alive," 
said 
Napoleon. 
"Lift 
this 
young 
man 
up 
and
carry 
him 
to 
the 
dressing 
station."

Having 
said 
this, 
Napoleon 
rode 
on 
to 
meet 
Marshal 
Lannes, 
who, 
hat 
in
hand, 
rode 
up 
smiling 
to 
the 
Emperor 
to 
congratulate 
him 
on 
the 
victory.

Prince 
Andrew 
remembered 
nothing 
more: 
he 
lost 
consciousness 
from 
the
terrible 
pain 
of 
being 
lifted 
onto 
the 
stretcher, 
the 
jolting 
while
being 
moved, 
and 
the 
probing 
of 
his 
wound 
at 
the 
dressing 
station.
He 
did 
not 
regain 
consciousness 
till 
late 
in 
the 
day, 
when 
with 
other
wounded 
and 
captured 
Russian 
officers 
he 
was 
carried 
to 
the 
hospital.
During 
this 
transfer 
he 
felt 
a 
little 
stronger 
and 
was 
able 
to 
look
about 
him 
and 
even 
speak.

The 
first 
words 
he 
heard 
on 
coming 
to 
his 
senses 
were 
those 
of 
a 
French
convoy 
officer, 
who 
said 
rapidly: 
"We 
must 
halt 
here: 
the 
Emperor
will 
pass 
here 
immediately; 
it 
will 
please 
him 
to 
see 
these 
gentlemen
prisoners."

"There 
are 
so 
many 
prisoners 
today, 
nearly 
the 
whole 
Russian 
army,
that 
he 
is 
probably 
tired 
of 
them," 
said 
another 
officer.

"All<p>
the 
same!<p>
They 
say 
this 
one 
is 
the 
commander 
of 
all 
the 
Emperor
Alexander's 
Guards," 
said 
the 
first 
one, 
indicating 
a 
Russian
officer 
in 
the 
white 
uniform 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards.

Bolkonski 
recognized 
Prince 
Repnin 
whom 
he 
had 
met 
in 
Petersburg
society. 
Beside 
him 
stood 
a 
lad 
of 
nineteen, 
also 
a 
wounded 
officer 
of
the 
Horse 
Guards.

Bonaparte, 
having 
come 
up 
at 
a 
gallop, 
stopped 
his 
horse.

"Which 
is 
the 
senior?" 
he 
asked, 
on 
seeing 
the 
prisoners.

They 
named 
the 
colonel, 
Prince 
Repnin.

"You 
are 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander's 
regiment 
of 
Horse
Guards?" 
asked 
Napoleon.

"I 
commanded 
a 
squadron," 
replied 
Repnin.

"Your 
regiment 
fulfilled 
its 
duty 
honorably," 
said 
Napoleon.

"The 
praise 
of 
a 
great 
commander 
is 
a 
soldier's 
highest 
reward,"
said 
Repnin.

"I 
bestow 
it 
with 
pleasure," 
said 
Napoleon. 
"And 
who 
is 
that 
young
man 
beside 
you?"

Prince 
Repnin 
named 
Lieutenant 
Sukhtelen.

After 
looking 
at 
him 
Napoleon 
smiled.

"He's 
very<p>
young 
to 
come 
to 
meddle 
with 
us."

"Youth 
is 
no 
hindrance 
to 
courage," 
muttered 
Sukhtelen 
in 
a 
failing
voice.

"A 
splendid 
reply!" 
said 
Napoleon.

hussars</h1>to 
retreat 
with 
the 
infantry. 
They 
were 
cut 
off 
from
the 
line 
of 
retreat 
on 
the 
left 
by 
the 
French. 
However 
inconvenient 
the
position, 
it 
was 
now 
necessary 
to 
attack 
in 
order 
to 
cut 
a 
way 
through
for 
themselves.

The 
squadron 
in 
which 
Rostov 
was 
serving 
had 
scarcely 
time 
to 
mount
before 
it 
was 
halted 
facing 
the 
enemy. 
Again, 
as 
at 
the 
Enns 
bridge,
there 
was 
nothing 
between 
the 
squadron 
and 
the 
enemy, 
and 
again 
that
terrible 
dividing 
line 
of 
uncertainty 
and 
fear-resembling 
the 
line
separating 
the 
living 
from 
the 
dead-lay 
between 
them. 
All 
were
conscious 
of 
this 
unseen 
line, 
and 
the 
question 
whether 
they 
would 
cross
it 
or 
not, 
and 
how 
they 
would 
cross 
it, 
agitated 
them 
all.

The 
colonel 
rode 
to 
the 
front, 
angrily 
gave 
some 
reply 
to 
questions 
put
to 
him 
by 
the 
officers, 
and,<p>
like 
a 
man 
desperately 
insisting 
on 
having
his 
own 
way, 
gave 
an 
order.<p>
No 
one 
said 
anything 
definite, 
but 
the 
rumor
of 
an 
attack 
spread 
through 
the 
squadron. 
The 
command 
to 
form 
up 
rang
out 
and 
the 
sabers 
whizzed 
as 
they 
were 
drawn 
from 
their 
scabbards.
Still 
no 
one 
moved. 
The 
troops 
of 
the 
left 
flank, 
infantry 
and 
hussars
alike, 
felt 
that 
the 
commander 
did 
not 
himself 
know 
what 
to 
do, 
and 
this
irresolution 
communicated 
itself 
to 
the 
men.

"If 
only 
they 
would 
be 
quick!" 
thought 
Rostov, 
feeling 
that 
at 
last
the 
time 
had 
come 
to 
experience 
the 
joy 
of 
an 
attack 
of 
which<p>
he 
had 
so
often 
heard 
from 
his 
fellow 
hussars.

"Fo'ward, 
with 
God, 
lads!" 
rang 
out 
Denisov's 
voice. 
"At 
a
twot 
fo'ward!"

The 
horses' 
croups 
began 
to 
sway 
in 
the 
front 
line. 
Rook 
pulled 
at 
the
reins 
and 
started 
of 
his 
own 
accord.

Before 
him, 
on 
the 
right, 
Rostov 
saw 
the 
front 
lines 
of 
his 
hussars 
and
still 
farther 
ahead 
a 
dark 
line 
which 
he 
could 
not 
see 
distinctly 
but
took 
to 
be 
the 
enemy. 
Shots 
could 
be 
heard, 
but 
some 
way 
off.

"Faster!" 
came 
the 
word 
of 
command, 
and 
Rostov 
felt 
Rook's 
flanks
drooping 
as 
he 
broke 
into 
a 
gallop.

Rostov 
anticipated 
his 
horse's 
movements 
and 
became 
more 
and 
more
elated. 
He 
had<p>
noticed 
a 
solitary 
tree 
ahead 
of 
him. 
This 
tree 
had 
been
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
line 
that 
had 
seemed 
so 
terrible-and 
now 
he
had 
crossed 
that 
line 
and 
not 
only 
was 
there 
nothing 
terrible, 
but
everything 
was 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
happy 
and 
animated. 
"Oh, 
how 
I
will 
slash 
at 
him!" 
thought 
Rostov, 
gripping 
the 
hilt 
of 
his 
saber.

"Hur-a-a-a-ah!" 
came 
a 
roar 
of 
voices. 
"Let 
anyone 
come 
my 
way
now," 
thought 
Rostov 
driving 
his 
spurs 
into 
Rook 
and 
letting 
him 
go
at 
a 
full 
gallop 
so 
that 
he 
outstripped 
the 
others. 
Ahead, 
the 
enemy 
was
already 
visible. 
Suddenly 
something 
like 
a 
birch 
broom 
seemed 
to 
sweep
over 
the 
squadron. 
Rostov 
raised 
his 
saber, 
ready 
to 
strike,<p>
but 
at
that 
instant 
the 
trooper 
Nikitenko, 
who 
was 
galloping 
ahead, 
shot 
away
from 
him, 
and 
Rostov 
felt 
as 
in 
a 
dream 
that 
he 
continued 
to 
be 
carried
forward 
with 
unnatural 
speed 
but 
yet 
stayed 
on 
the 
same 
spot. 
From
behind 
him<p>
Bondarchuk, 
an 
hussar 
he 
knew, 
jolted 
against 
him 
and 
looked
angrily 
at 
him. 
Bondarchuk's 
horse 
swerved 
and 
galloped 
past.

"How 
is 
it 
I 
am 
not 
moving? 
I 
have 
fallen, 
I 
am 
killed!" 
Rostov
asked 
and 
answered 
at 
the 
same 
instant. 
He 
was 
alone 
in 
the 
middle 
of<p>
a
field. 
Instead 
of 
the 
moving 
horses 
and 
hussars' 
backs, 
he 
saw 
nothing
before 
him 
but 
the 
motionless 
earth 
and 
the 
stubble 
around<p>
him. 
There
was 
warm 
blood 
under 
his 
arm. 
"No, 
I 
am<p>
wounded 
and 
the 
horse 
is
killed." 
Rook 
tried 
to 
rise 
on 
his 
forelegs 
but 
fell 
back, 
pinning 
his
rider's 
leg. 
Blood 
was 
flowing 
from 
his 
head; 
he 
struggled 
but 
could
not 
rise.

CHAPTER 
XIII

On 
the 
seventeenth 
of 
August 
Rostov 
and 
Ilyin, 
accompanied 
by 
Lavrushka
who 
had 
just 
returned 
from 
captivity 
and 
by 
an 
hussar 
orderly, 
left
their 
quarters 
at 
Yankovo, 
ten 
miles 
from 
Bogucharovo, 
and 
went 
for 
a
ride-to 
try 
a 
new 
horse 
Ilyin 
had 
bought 
and 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
there
was 
any 
hay 
to 
be 
had 
in 
the 
villages.

For 
the 
last 
three 
days 
Bogucharovo 
had 
lain 
between 
the 
two 
hostile
armies, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
as 
easy 
for 
the 
Russian 
rearguard 
to 
get 
to 
it 
as
for 
the 
French 
vanguard; 
Rostov, 
as 
a 
careful 
squadron 
commander, 
wished
to 
take 
such 
provisions 
as 
remained 
at 
Bogucharovo 
before 
the 
French
could 
get 
them.

Rostov 
and 
Ilyin 
were 
in 
the 
merriest 
of 
moods. 
On 
the 
way 
to
Bogucharovo, 
a 
princely 
estate 
with 
a 
dwelling 
house 
and 
farm 
where
they<p>
hoped 
to 
find 
many 
domestic 
serfs 
and 
pretty 
girls, 
they 
questioned
Lavrushka 
about 
Napoleon 
and 
laughed 
at 
his 
stories, 
and 
raced 
one
another 
to 
try 
Ilyin's 
horse.

Rostov 
had 
no 
idea 
that 
the 
village 
he 
was 
entering 
was 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cp7Ufz6ClqSz.html">property</a> 
of
that 
very 
Bolkonski 
who 
had 
been 
engaged 
to 
his 
sister.

Rostov 
and 
Ilyin 
gave 
rein 
to 
their 
horses 
for 
a 
last 
race 
along 
the
incline 
before 
reaching 
Bogucharovo, 
and 
Rostov, 
outstripping 
Ilyin, 
was
the 
first 
to 
gallop 
<a href="/aVzUge/Jk1i6leWib5hsJDK.html">into</a> 
the 
village 
street.

"You're 
first!"<p>
cried 
Ilyin, 
flushed.

"Yes, 
always 
first 
both 
on 
the 
grassland 
and 
here," 
answered 
Rostov,
stroking 
his 
heated 
Donets 
horse.

"And 
I'd 
have 
won 
on 
my 
Frenchy, 
your 
excellency," 
said 
Lavrushka
from 
behind, 
alluding 
to 
his 
shabby 
cart 
horse, 
"only 
I 
didn't 
wish 
to
mortify 
you."

They 
rode 
at 
a 
footpace 
to 
the 
barn, 
where 
a 
large 
crowd 
of 
<a href="/cZl/DU5e23A.html">peasants</a> 
was
standing.

Some 
of 
the 
men 
bared 
their 
heads, 
others 
stared 
at 
the 
new<p>
arrivals
without 
doffing 
their 
caps. 
Two 
tall 
old 
peasants 
with 
wrinkled 
faces
and 
scanty 
beards 
emerged 
from 
the 
tavern, 
smiling, 
staggering, 
and
singing 
some 
incoherent 
song, 
and 
approached 
the 
officers.

"Fine 
fellows!" 
said 
Rostov 
laughing. 
"Is 
there 
any 
hay 
here?"

"And 
how 
like 
one 
another," 
said 
Ilyin.

"A 
mo-o-st 
me-r-r-y 
co-o-m-pa...!" 
sang 
one 
of 
the 
peasants 
with 
a
blissful 
smile.

One

Till

my 
dear 
fellow.

Next 
day, 
at 
eight 
in 
the 
morning, 
Pierre 
and 
Nesvitski 
drove 
to 
the
Sokolniki 
forest 
and 
found 
Dolokhov, 
Denisov, 
and 
Rostov 
already
there. 
Pierre 
had 
the 
air 
of 
a 
man 
preoccupied 
with 
considerations 
which
had 
no 
connection 
with 
the

Besides, 
it 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
the
society 
of 
women 
was 
rather 
derogatory 
to 
his 
manhood. 
He 
went 
to 
balls
and 
into 
ladies' 
society 
with 
an 
affectation 
of 
doing 
so 
against 
his
will. 
The 
races, 
the 
English 
Club, 
sprees 
with 
Denisov, 
and<p>
visits 
to
a 
certain 
house-that 
was 
another 
matter 
and 
quite 
the 
thing 
for 
a
dashing 
young 
hussar!

At 
the 
beginning 
of 
March, 
old 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov 
was 
very 
busy
arranging 
a 
dinner 
in 
honor 
of 
Prince 
Bagration 
at 
the 
English 
Club.

The 
count 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
the 
hall 
in 
his 
dressing 
gown, 
giving
orders 
to 
the 
club 
steward 
and 
to 
the 
famous 
Feoktist, 
the 
club's
head 
cook, 
about 
asparagus, 
fresh 
cucumbers, 
strawberries, 
veal, 
and
fish 
for 
this 
dinner. 
The 
count 
had 
been 
a 
member 
and 
on 
the 
committee
of 
the 
club<p>
from 
the 
day 
it 
was 
founded. 
To 
him 
the 
club 
entrusted 
the
arrangement 
of 
the 
festival 
in 
honor 
of 
Bagration, 
for 
few 
men 
knew
so 
well 
how 
to 
arrange 
<a href="/cZl/dG51mk.html">a</a> 
feast 
on 
an 
open-handed, 
hospitable 
scale,
and 
still 
fewer 
men 
would 
be 
so 
well 
able 
and 
willing 
to 
make 
up 
out 
of
their 
own 
resources 
what 
might 
be 
needed 
for 
the 
success 
of 
the 
fete.
The 
club 
cook 
and 
the 
steward 
listened 
to 
the 
count's 
orders 
with
pleased 
faces, 
for 
they 
knew 
that 
under 
no 
other 
management 
could 
they
so 
easily 
extract 
a 
good 
profit 
for 
themselves 
from 
a 
dinner 
costing
several 
thousand 
rubles.

"Well 
then, 
mind 
and 
have 
cocks' 
comb 
in 
the 
turtle 
soup, 
you
know!"

"Shall 
we 
have 
three 
cold 
dishes 
then?" 
asked 
the 
cook.

The 
count 
considered.

"We 
can't 
have 
less-yes, 
three... 
the 
mayonnaise, 
that's 
one,"
said 
he, 
bending 
down 
a 
finger.

"Then 
am 
I 
to 
order 
those 
large 
sterlets?" 
asked 
the 
steward.

"Yes, 
it 
can't 
be 
helped 
if 
they 
won't 
take 
less. 
<a href="/aVzUge/pD9Vd5AyyZE3wUl.html">Ah,</a> 
dear 
me! 
I
was 
forgetting. 
We 
must 
have 
another 
entree. 
Ah, 
goodness 
gracious!"
he 
clutched 
at 
his 
head. 
"Who 
is 
going 
to 
get 
me 
the 
flowers? 
Dmitri!
Eh, 
Dmitri! 
Gallop 
off 
to 
our 
Moscow 
estate," 
he 
said 
to 
the 
factotum
who 
appeared 
at 
his 
call. 
"Hurry 
off 
and 
tell 
Maksim, 
the 
gardener,
to 
set 
the 
serfs 
to 
work. 
Say 
that 
everything 
out 
of 
the 
hothouses 
must
be 
brought 
here 
well 
wrapped 
up 
in 
felt. 
I 
must 
have 
two 
hundred 
pots
here 
on 
Friday."

Having 
given 
several 
more 
orders, 
he 
was 
about 
to 
go 
to 
his 
"little
countess" 
to 
have 
a 
rest, 
but 
remembering 
something 
else 
of
importance, 
he 
returned 
again, 
called 
back 
the 
cook 
and 
the<p>
club
steward, 
and 
again 
began 
giving 
orders. 
A 
light 
footstep 
and 
the
clinking 
of 
spurs<p>
were 
heard 
at 
the 
door, 
and 
the 
young 
count, 
handsome,
rosy, 
with 
a 
dark 
little 
mustache, 
evidently 
rested 
and 
made 
sleeker<p>
by
his 
easy 
life 
in 
Moscow, 
entered 
the 
room.

"Ah,

boy,

said 
the

man 
with 
a 
smile,
as 
if 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iP7IgdEd78g.html">he</a> 
felt 
a

his

seemed

he 
kept

more,

more.

Next 
morning, 
after 
the

In

a

of

dirty

Two

just 
been

by 
the

The

were 
bringing

hot 
water 
for 
shaving, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/fu7Y2ugXx.html">their

There 
was 
a

a

of 
tobacco.

he 
inquired.

"What 
am 
I 
to 
say 
to 
him?" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
down 
on 
the
old 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/aYs6UHdX4up8EnBVm.html">man's</a> 
bald 
head 
shining 
in 
the 
sun 
and 
seeing 
by 
the 
expression 
on
his

that 
the 
old 
man 
himself 
understood 
how<p>
untimely 
such 
questions
were 
and 
only 
asked 
them 
to 
allay 
his 
grief.

"Yes, 
let 
them 
have 
it," 
replied 
Prince 
Andrew.

"If 
you 
noticed 
some 
disorder 
in 
the 
garden," 
said 
Alpatych, 
"it 
was
impossible 
to 
prevent 
it. 
Three 
regiments 
have 
been 
here 
and 
spent
the 
night, 
dragoons 
mostly. 
I 
took 
down 
the 
name 
and 
rank 
of 
their
commanding 
officer, 
to 
hand 
in 
a 
complaint 
about 
it."

"Well, 
and 
what 
are<p>
you 
going 
to 
do? 
Will 
you 
stay 
here 
if 
the 
enemy
occupies 
the 
place?" 
asked 
Prince 
Andrew.

Alpatych 
turned 
his 
face 
to 
Prince 
Andrew, 
looked 
at 
him, 
and 
suddenly
with 
a 
solemn 
gesture 
raised 
his 
arm.

"He 
is 
my 
refuge! 
His 
will 
be 
done!" 
he 
exclaimed.

A 
group 
of 
bareheaded 
peasants 
was 
approaching 
across 
the 
meadow 
toward
the 
prince.

"Well, 
good-by!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew, 
bending 
over 
to 
Alpatych. 
"You
must 
go 
away 
too, 
take 
away 
what 
you 
can 
and 
tell 
the 
serfs 
to 
go 
to 
the
Ryazan 
estate 
or 
to 
the 
one 
near 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UMG3t5uq4VWVhi.html">Moscow."

Alpatych</a> 
clung 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
leg 
and 
burst 
into 
sobs. 
Gently
disengaging 
himself, 
the 
prince 
spurred 
his 
horse 
and 
rode 
down 
the
avenue 
at 
a 
gallop.

The 
old 
man 
was 
still 
sitting 
in 
the 
ornamental 
garden, 
like 
a 
fly
impassive 
on 
the 
face 
of 
a 
loved 
one 
who 
is 
dead, 
tapping 
the 
last 
on
which 
he 
was 
making 
the 
bast 
shoe, 
and 
two 
little 
girls, 
running 
out
from 
the 
hot 
house 
carrying 
in 
their 
skirts 
plums 
they 
had 
plucked 
from
the 
trees 
there, 
came 
upon 
Prince 
Andrew. 
On 
seeing 
the 
young 
master,
the 
elder 
one 
with 
frightened 
look 
clutched 
her 
younger 
companion 
by 
the
hand 
and 
hid 
with 
her 
behind 
a 
birch 
tree, 
not 
stopping 
to 
pick 
<a href="/aVzUge/XB1ddue81ujvI.html">up</a> 
some
green 
plums 
they 
had 
dropped.

Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
away 
with 
startled 
haste, 
unwilling 
to 
let 
them
see 
that 
they 
had 
been 
observed. 
He 
was 
sorry 
for 
the 
pretty 
frightened
little 
girl, 
was 
afraid 
of 
looking 
at 
her, 
and 
yet 
felt 
an 
irresistible
desire 
to 
do 
so. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tH8CmeS2COCd0dBoY.html">A</a> 
new 
sensation 
of 
comfort 
and 
relief 
came 
over 
him
when, 
seeing 
these 
girls, 
he 
realized 
the 
existence 
of 
other 
human
interests 
entirely 
aloof 
from 
his 
own 
and 
just 
as 
legitimate 
as 
those
that 
occupied 
him. 
Evidently 
these 
girls 
passionately 
desired 
one
thing-to 
carry 
away 
and 
eat 
those 
green 
plums 
without 
being 
caught-and
Prince 
Andrew 
shared 
their 
wish 
for 
the 
success 
of 
their 
enterprise. 
He
could 
not 
resist 
looking 
at 
them 
once 
more. 
Believing 
their 
danger 
past,
they 
sprang 
from 
their 
ambush 
and, 
chirruping 
something 
in 
their 
shrill
little 
voices 
and 
holding 
up 
their 
skirts, 
their 
bare 
little 
sunburned
feet 
scampered 
merrily

quickly 
across 
the

Prince

stood 
by

talking

listened 
to

In

tears

him, 
a

he

at

time 
sad.
He 
had 
absolutely 
nothing 
to 
weep 
about 
yet 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
weep. 
What
about? 
His 
former 
love? 
The 
little 
princess? 
His 
disillusionments?...
His 
hopes 
for 
the 
future?... 
Yes 
and 
no. 
The

a

Pierre 
first 
looked 
down 
the 
field 
across 
which 
vehicles 
and 
horsemen
were 
passing 
that 
morning, 
then 
into 
the 
distance 
across 
the 
river, 
then
at 
the 
dog 
who 
was 
pretending 
to 
be 
in 
earnest 
about 
biting 
him,
and 
then 
at 
his 
bare 
feet 
which 
he 
placed 
with 
pleasure 
in 
various
positions, 
moving 
his 
dirty 
thick 
big 
toes. 
Every 
time 
he 
looked 
at 
his
bare 
feet 
a 
smile 
of 
animated 
self-satisfaction 
flitted 
across 
his 
face.
The 
sight 
of 
them 
reminded 
him 
of 
all 
he 
had 
experienced 
and 
learned
during 
these 
weeks 
and 
this 
recollection 
was 
pleasant 
to 
him.

For 
some 
days 
the 
weather 
had 
been 
calm 
and 
clear 
with 
slight 
frosts 
in
the 
mornings-what 
is 
called 
an 
"old 
wives' 
summer."

In 
the 
sunshine 
the 
air 
was 
warm, 
and 
that 
warmth 
<a href="/cZl/FvO6hai1bvg.html">was</a> 
particularly
pleasant 
with 
the 
invigorating 
freshness 
of 
the 
morning 
frost 
still 
in
the 
air.

On 
everything-far 
and 
near-lay 
the 
magic 
crystal 
glitter 
seen 
only 
at
that 
time 
of 
autumn. 
The 
Sparrow 
Hills 
were 
visible 
in 
the 
distance,
with 
the 
village, 
the 
church, 
and 
the 
large 
white 
house. 
The 
bare

the

Helene-having 
realized 
that 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/LN8bju0.html">main</a> 
object
of 
all 
these 
words 
and 
all 
this 
trouble 
was, 
after 
converting 
her 
to
Catholicism, 
to 
obtain 
money 
from 
her 
for 
Jesuit 
institutions 
(as 
to
which 
she 
received 
indications)-before 
parting 
with 
her 
money 
insisted
that 
the 
various 
operations 
necessary 
to 
free<p>
her 
from 
her 
husband
should 
be 
performed. 
In 
her 
view 
the 
aim 
of 
every 
religion 
was 
merely
to 
preserve 
certain 
proprieties 
while 
affording 
satisfaction 
to
human 
desires. 
And 
with 
this 
aim, 
in 
one 
of 
her 
talks 
with 
her 
Father
Confessor, 
she 
insisted 
on 
an 
answer 
to 
the 
question, 
in 
how 
far 
was 
she
bound 
by 
her 
marriage?

They 
were 
sitting 
in 
the 
twilight 
by 
a 
window 
in 
the 
drawing 
room.
The 
scent 
of 
flowers 
came 
in 
at 
the 
window. 
Helene 
was 
wearing 
a 
white
dress, 
transparent 
over 
her 
shoulders 
and 
bosom. 
The 
abbe, 
a 
well-fed
man 
with 
a 
plump, 
clean-shaven 
chin, 
a 
pleasant 
firm 
mouth, 
and 
white
hands<p>
meekly 
folded 
on 
his 
knees, 
sat 
close 
to 
Helene 
and, 
with 
a
subtle 
smile 
on 
his 
lips 
and 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/OuD6Nz3N4KA.html">peaceful</a> 
look 
of 
delight 
at 
her 
beauty,
occasionally 
glanced 
at 
her 
face 
as 
he 
explained 
his 
opinion 
on 
the
subject. 
Helene 
with 
an 
uneasy 
smile 
looked 
at 
his 
curly 
hair 
and 
his
plump, 
clean-shaven, 
blackish 
cheeks 
and 
every 
moment 
expected 
the
conversation 
to 
take 
a 
fresh 
turn. 
But 
the 
abbe, 
though 
he 
evidently
enjoyed 
the 
beauty 
of 
his 
companion, 
was 
absorbed 
in 
his 
mastery 
of 
the
matter.

The 
course 
of 
the 
Father 
Confessor's 
arguments 
ran 
as 
follows: 
"Ignorant
of 
the 
import 
of 
what 
you 
were 
undertaking, 
you 
made 
a 
vow 
of 
conjugal
fidelity 
to 
a 
man 
who 
on 
his 
part, 
by 
entering 
the 
married 
state 
without
faith 
in 
the 
religious 
significance 
of 
marriage, 
committed 
an 
act 
of
sacrilege. 
That 
marriage 
lacked 
the 
dual 
significance 
it 
should 
have
had. 
Yet 
in 
spite 
of 
this 
your 
vow 
was 
binding. 
You 
swerved 
from 
it.
What 
did 
you 
commit 
by 
so 
acting? 
A 
venial, 
or 
a 
mortal, 
sin? 
A 
venial
sin, 
for 
you 
acted 
without 
evil 
intention. 
If 
now 
you 
married<p>
again
with 
the 
object 
of 
bearing 
children, 
your 
sin 
might 
be 
forgiven. 
But 
the
question 
is 
again 
a 
twofold 
one: 
firstly..."

But 
suddenly 
Helene, 
who 
was 
getting 
bored, 
said<p>
with 
one 
of 
her
bewitching 
smiles: 
"But 
I 
think 
that 
having 
espoused 
the 
true 
religion 
I
cannot 
be 
bound 
by 
what

false

Laws

become

only 
when 
he

motion;

at 
the

time, 
a<p>

Prince 
Andrew
with 
a 
lady 
passed 
by, 
evidently 
not 
recognizing 
them. 
The 
handsome
Anatole 
was 
smilingly 
talking 
to 
a 
partner 
on 
his 
arm 
and 
looked 
at
Natasha 
as 
one 
looks 
at 
a 
wall. 
Boris 
passed 
them 
twice 
and 
each 
time
turned 
away. 
Berg 
and 
his 
wife, 
who 
were 
not 
dancing, 
came 
up 
to 
them.

This 
family 
gathering 
seemed 
humiliating 
to 
Natasha-as 
if 
there 
were
nowhere 
else 
for 
the 
family 
to 
talk 
but 
here 
at 
the 
ball. 
She 
did 
not
listen 
to 
or 
look 
at 
Vera, 
who 
was 
telling 
her 
something 
about 
her 
own
green 
dress.

At 
last 
the 
Emperor 
stopped 
beside 
his 
last 
partner 
(he 
had 
danced
with<p>
three) 
and 
the 
music 
ceased. 
A 
worried 
aide-de-camp 
ran 
up 
to 
the
Rostovs 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/CT4Vd1o8M.html">requesting</a> 
them 
to 
stand 
farther<p>
back, 
though 
as 
it 
was 
they
were 
already 
close 
to 
the

and 
from 
the 
gallery 
resounded 
the
distinct, 
precise, 
enticingly 
rhythmical 
strains 
of 
a 
waltz. 
The 
Emperor
looked 
smilingly 
down 
the 
room. 
A 
minute 
passed 
but 
no 
one 
had 
yet 
begun
dancing. 
An 
aide-de-camp, 
the 
Master 
of 
Ceremonies, 
went 
up 
to 
Countess
Bezukhova 
and 
asked 
her 
to 
dance. 
She 
smilingly 
raised 
her 
hand 
and
laid 
it 
on 
his 
shoulder 
without 
looking 
at 
him. 
The 
aide-de-camp, 
an
adept 
in 
his 
art, 
grasping 
his 
partner 
firmly 
round 
her 
waist, 
with
confident 
<a href="/cZl/yY6l5dZEO8hMvng.html">deliberation</a> 
started 
smoothly, 
gliding 
first 
round 
the 
edge 
of
the 
circle, 
then 
at 
the 
corner 
of 
the 
room 
he 
caught 
Helene's
left 
hand 
and 
turned 
her, 
the 
only 
sound 
audible, 
apart 
from 
the
ever-quickening 
music, 
being 
the 
rhythmic 
click 
of 
the 
spurs 
on 
his
rapid, 
agile 
feet, 
while 
at 
every 
third 
beat 
his 
partner's 
velvet
dress 
spread 
out 
and 
seemed 
to 
flash 
as 
she 
whirled 
round. 
Natasha
gazed 
at 
them 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
cry 
because 
it 
was 
not 
she 
who 
was
dancing 
that 
first 
turn<p>
of 
the 
waltz.

Prince 
Andrew, 
in 
the 
white 
uniform 
of 
a 
cavalry 
colonel, 
wearing
stockings 
and 
dancing 
shoes, 
stood 
looking 
animated 
and 
bright 
in 
the
front 
row 
of 
the 
circle 
not 
far 
from 
the 
Rostovs. 
Baron 
Firhoff 
was
talking 
to 
him 
about 
the 
first 
sitting 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
State 
to 
be
held 
next 
day. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
as 
one 
closely 
connected 
with 
Speranski
and 
participating 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the 
legislative 
commission, 
could 
give
reliable 
information 
about 
that 
sitting, 
concerning 
which 
various 
rumors
were 
current. 
But 
not 
listening 
to 
what 
Firhoff 
was 
saying, 
he 
was
gazing 
now 
at 
the 
sovereign 
and 
now 
at<p>
the 
men 
intending 
to 
dance 
who
had<p>
not 
yet 
gathered<p>
courage 
to 
enter 
the 
circle.

Prince 
Andrew 
was 
watching 
these 
men 
abashed 
by 
the 
Emperor's
presence, 
and 
the 
women 
who<p>
were 
breathlessly 
longing 
to 
be 
asked 
to
dance.

Pierre 
came 
up 
to 
him 
and 
caught 
him 
by 
the 
arm.

"You 
always 
dance. 
I 
have 
a 
protegee, 
the 
young 
Rostova, 
here. 
Ask
her," 
he 
said.

"Where 
is 
she?" 
asked 
Bolkonski. 
"Excuse 
me!" 
he 
added, 
turning
to 
the 
baron, 
"we 
will 
finish 
this 
conversation 
elsewhere-at<p>
a 
ball
one 
must 
dance." 
He 
stepped 
forward 
in 
the 
direction 
Pierre 
indicated.
The 
despairing, 
dejected 
expression 
of 
Natasha's 
face 
caught 
his 
eye.
He 
recognized 
her, 
guessed 
her 
feelings, 
saw 
that 
it 
was 
her<p>
debut,
remembered 
her 
conversation 
at 
the 
window, 
and 
with 
an 
expression 
of
pleasure 
on 
his 
face 
approached 
Countess 
Rostova.

"Allow

CHAPTER 
V

That 
same 
evening 
there 
was 
an 
animated 
discussion 
among 
the
squadron's 
officers 
in 
Denisov's 
quarters.

"And 
I 
tell 
you, 
Rostov, 
that 
you 
must 
apologize 
to 
the 
colonel!"
said 
a 
tall, 
grizzly-haired 
staff 
captain, 
with 
enormous 
mustaches 
<a href="/aVzUge/YE7mbEd9f4tHLaX.html">and
many</a> 
wrinkles 
on 
his 
large 
features, 
to 
Rostov 
who 
was 
crimson 
with
excitement.

The 
staff 
captain, 
Kirsten, 
had 
twice 
been 
reduced 
to 
the 
ranks 
for
affairs 
of 
honor 
and 
had 
twice 
regained 
<a href="/aVzUge/zJ4UDh7Nz3s.html">his</a> 
commission.

"I 
will 
allow 
no 
one 
to 
call 
me 
a 
liar!" 
cried 
Rostov. 
"He 
told
me 
I 
lied, 
and 
I 
told 
him 
he 
lied. 
And 
there 
it 
rests. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YI3tTZW0YfX3EJ.html">He</a> 
may 
keep 
me
on 
duty 
every 
day, 
or 
may 
place 
me 
under 
arrest, 
but 
no 
one 
can 
make
me 
apologize, 
because 
if 
he, 
as 
commander 
of 
this 
regiment, 
thinks 
it
beneath 
his 
dignity 
to 
give 
me 
satisfaction, 
then..."

"You 
just 
wait 
a 
moment, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
and 
listen," 
interrupted
the 
staff 
captain 
in 
his 
deep 
bass, 
calmly 
stroking 
his 
long 
mustache.
"You 
tell 
the 
colonel 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
other 
officers 
that 
an
officer 
has 
stolen..."

"I'm 
not 
to 
blame 
that 
the 
conversation 
began 
in 
the 
presence 
of
other 
officers. 
Perhaps 
I 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
spoken 
before 
them, 
but 
I 
am
not 
a 
diplomatist. 
That's 
why 
I 
joined 
the 
hussars, 
thinking 
that 
here
one 
would 
not 
need 
finesse; 
and 
he 
tells 
me 
that 
I 
am 
lying-so 
let 
him
give 
me 
satisfaction..."

"That's 
all 
right. 
No 
one 
thinks 
you 
a 
coward, 
but 
that's 
not 
the
point. 
Ask 
Denisov 
whether 
it 
is 
not 
out 
of 
the 
question 
for 
a 
cadet 
to
demand 
satisfaction 
of 
his 
regimental 
commander?"

Denisov 
sat 
gloomily 
biting 
his 
mustache<p>
and 
listening 
to 
the
conversation, 
evidently 
with 
no 
wish 
to 
take 
part 
in 
it. 
He 
answered 
the
staff 
captain's 
question 
by 
a 
disapproving 
shake 
of 
his 
head.

"You 
speak 
to 
the 
colonel 
about 
this<p>
nasty 
business 
before 
other
officers," 
continued 
the 
staff 
captain, 
"and 
Bogdanich" 
(the
colonel 
was 
called 
Bogdanich) 
"shuts 
you 
up."

"He 
did 
not 
shut 
me 
up, 
he 
said 
I 
was 
telling 
an 
untruth."

"Well, 
have 
it 
so, 
and 
you 
talked 
a<p>
lot 
of 
nonsense 
to 
him 
and 
must
apologize."

"Not 
on 
any 
account!" 
exclaimed 
Rostov.

"I 
did 
not 
expect 
this 
of 
you," 
said 
the 
staff 
captain 
seriously 
and
severely. 
"You 
don't 
wish 
to 
apologize, 
but, 
man, 
it's 
not 
only 
to
him 
but 
to 
the 
whole 
regiment-all 
of 
us-you're 
to 
blame 
all 
round.
The 
case 
is 
this: 
you 
ought 
to 
have 
thought 
the 
matter 
over 
and
taken 
advice;<p>
but 
no, 
you 
go 
and 
blurt 
it 
all 
straight 
out 
before 
the
officers. 
Now 
what 
was 
the 
colonel 
to 
do? 
Have 
the 
officer 
tried<p>
and
disgrace 
the 
whole 
regiment? 
Disgrace 
the 
whole 
regiment 
because 
of 
one
scoundrel? 
Is 
that 
how 
you 
look 
at 
it? 
We 
don't 
see 
it 
like 
that. 
And
Bogdanich 
was 
a 
brick: 
he 
told 
you 
you 
were 
saying 
what 
was 
not 
true.
It's 
not 
pleasant, 
but 
what's 
to 
be 
done, 
my 
dear 
fellow? 
You 
landed
yourself 
in 
it. 
And 
now, 
when 
one 
wants 
to 
smooth 
the 
thing 
over, 
some
conceit 
prevents 
your 
apologizing, 
and 
you 
wish 
to 
make 
the 
whole
affair 
public. 
You 
are 
offended<p>
at 
being 
put 
on 
duty 
a 
bit, 
but 
why 
not
apologize 
to 
an 
old

honorable 
officer? 
Whatever 
Bogdanich 
may
be, 
anyway 
he 
is 
an

You're

XXIV

On 
the

of 
the 
first 
of 
September, 
after 
his 
interview 
with
Kutuzov, 
Count 
Rostopchin

offended
because 
he 
had 
not 
been 
invited 
to 
attend

because 
Kutuzov

paid 
no

his 
offer 
to 
take 
part 
in 
the
defense 
of 
the 
city; 
amazed 
also 
at 
the 
novel 
outlook 
revealed 
to 
him
at 
the 
camp, 
which 
treated<p>
the 
tranquillity 
of 
the 
capital 
and 
its
patriotic 
fervor 
as 
not 
merely 
secondary 
but 
quite 
irrelevant

unimportant 
matters.

Bagration-being

to

coming 
under 
Barclay's

as 
long 
as 
he

Bagration 
was 
slow 
in 
effecting 
the
junction-though 
that 
was 
the 
chief 
aim 
of 
all 
at 
headquarters-because,
as 
he 
alleged, 
he 
exposed 
his 
army 
to 
danger 
on 
this 
march, 
and 
it 
was
best 
for 
him 
to 
retire 
more 
to 
the 
left 
and 
more 
to 
the 
south, 
worrying
the 
enemy 
from 
flank 
and 
rear 
and 
securing 
from 
the 
Ukraine 
recruits 
for
his 
army; 
and 
it 
looks 
as 
if 
he 
planned 
this 
in 
order 
not 
to 
come 
under
the 
command 
of 
the 
detested 
foreigner 
Barclay, 
whose 
rank 
was 
inferior
to 
his 
own.

The 
Emperor 
was 
with 
the 
army 
to 
encourage 
it, 
but 
his 
presence 
and
ignorance 
of 
what 
steps 
to 
take, 
and 
the 
enormous<p>
number 
of 
advisers 
and
plans, 
destroyed 
the 
first 
army's 
energy 
and 
it 
retired.

The 
intention 
was 
to 
make 
a 
stand 
at 
the 
Drissa 
camp, 
but 
Paulucci,
aiming 
at 
becoming 
commander 
in 
chief, 
unexpectedly 
employed 
his 
energy
to 
influence 
Alexander, 
and 
Pfuel's 
whole 
plan 
was 
abandoned 
and 
the
command 
entrusted 
to 
Barclay. 
But 
as 
Barclay 
did 
not 
inspire 
confidence
his 
power 
was 
limited. 
The 
armies 
were 
divided, 
there 
was 
no 
unity 
of
command, 
and 
Barclay 
was 
unpopular; 
but 
from 
this 
confusion, 
division,
and 
the 
unpopularity 
of 
the 
foreign 
commander 
in 
chief, 
there 
resulted
on 
the 
one 
hand 
indecision 
and 
the 
avoidance 
of 
a 
battle 
(which 
we 
could
not 
have 
refrained 
from 
had 
the 
armies 
been 
united 
and 
had 
someone 
else,
instead 
of 
Barclay, 
been 
in

and 
on 
the 
other 
an 
ever-increasing
indignation 
against 
the 
foreigners 
and 
an 
increase 
in 
patriotic 
zeal.

At

the 
Emperor

and 
as 
the 
most 
convenient

And 
he 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
with 
a 
mocking, 
challenging 
expression. 
He
evidently 
wished 
to 
draw 
him 
on.

"You

replied 
Pierre, 
growing 
more 
and 
more 
excited.

at

She

scornfully. 
Sonya

Boris 
and 
Natasha 
were 
at 
the

and 
ceased 
talking 
when 
Vera 
entered. 
Sonya 
and 
Natasha 
looked 
at
Vera 
with 
guilty, 
happy

no

in 
Vera.

"How

she

"You

she 
took

Nicholas.

"In

dipping 
his

"You

and, 
blocking

brought 
his

His 
large, 
glittering, 
masculine 
eyes 
were 
so 
close 
to 
hers 
that 
she 
saw
nothing

them.

"Natalie?"

in 
the

Natasha 
looked 
round 
at

then, 
red
and 
trembling, 
threw 
a 
frightened 
look 
of 
inquiry 
at 
Anatole 
and 
moved
toward 
the 
door.

"One 
word, 
just 
one,

cried 
Anatole.

She 
paused. 
She 
so 
wanted 
a 
word 
from 
him 
that 
would 
explain 
to 
her 
what
had

to

she 
could 
find

"Natalie,

he 
kept 
repeating, 
evidently 
not
knowing 
what

say 
and 
he 
repeated 
it 
till 
Helene 
came 
up 
to 
them.

Helene 
returned 
with 
Natasha 
to 
the

The 
Rostovs 
went
away 
without

After 
reaching 
home 
Natasha 
did 
not

She 
was 
tormented
by 
the 
insoluble 
question 
whether 
she 
loved 
Anatole 
or 
Prince 
Andrew.
She 
loved 
Prince 
Andrew-she 
remembered 
distinctly 
how 
deeply 
she 
loved
him. 
But 
she 
also 
loved 
Anatole, 
of 
that 
there 
was 
no 
doubt. 
"Else 
how
could 
all 
this 
have 
happened?" 
thought 
she. 
"If, 
after 
that, 
I 
could

into 
the 
sitting 
room 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
was
asked 
to 
play 
on 
the 
clavichord. 
Anatole, 
laughing 
and 
in 
high 
spirits,
came 
and 
leaned 
on 
his 
elbows, 
facing 
her 
and 
beside 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne. 
Princess 
Mary 
felt 
his 
look 
with 
a 
painfully 
joyous 
emotion.
Her 
favorite 
sonata 
bore 
her 
into 
a 
most 
intimately 
poetic 
world 
and
the 
look 
she 
felt 
upon 
her 
made 
that 
world 
still 
more<p>
poetic. 
But
Anatole's 
expression, 
though 
his 
eyes 
were 
fixed 
on 
her, 
referred 
not
to 
her 
but 
to 
the 
movements 
of 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
little
foot, 
which 
he 
was 
then 
touching 
with 
his 
own 
under 
the 
clavichord.
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
was 
also 
looking 
at 
Princess 
Mary, 
and 
in 
her
lovely 
eyes 
there 
was 
a 
look 
of 
fearful 
joy 
and 
hope 
that 
was 
also 
new
to 
the 
princess.

"How 
she 
loves<p>
me!" 
thought 
Princess 
Mary. 
"How<p>
happy 
I 
am 
now,
and 
how 
happy 
I 
may 
be 
with 
such 
a 
friend 
and 
such 
a 
husband! 
Husband?
Can 
it 
be 
possible?" 
she 
thought, 
not 
daring 
to 
look 
at 
his 
face, 
but
still 
feeling 
his 
eyes 
gazing 
at 
her.

In 
the 
evening, 
after 
supper, 
when 
all 
were 
about 
to 
retire, 
Anatole
kissed 
Princess 
Mary's 
hand. 
She 
did 
not 
know 
how 
she 
found 
the
courage, 
but 
she 
looked 
straight 
into 
his 
handsome<p>
face 
as 
it 
came 
near
to 
her 
shortsighted 
eyes. 
Turning 
from 
Princess 
Mary 
he 
went 
up 
and
kissed 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's 
hand. 
(This 
was 
not 
etiquette, 
but
then 
he 
did 
everything 
so 
simply 
and 
with 
such 
assurance!) 
Mademoiselle
Bourienne 
flushed, 
and 
gave 
the 
princess 
a 
frightened 
look.

"What 
delicacy!" 
thought 
the 
princess. 
"Is 
it 
possible 
that
Amelie" 
(Mademoiselle 
Bourienne) 
"thinks 
I 
could 
be 
jealous 
of 
her,
and 
not 
value 
her 
pure 
affection 
and 
devotion 
to 
me?" 
She 
went 
up
to 
her 
and 
kissed 
her 
warmly. 
Anatole 
went 
up 
to<p>
kiss 
the 
little
princess' 
hand.

"No!<p>
No! 
No! 
When 
your 
father 
writes 
to 
tell 
me 
that 
you 
are 
behaving
well 
I 
will 
give 
you 
my 
hand 
to 
kiss. 
Not 
till 
then!" 
she 
said. 
And
smilingly 
raising 
a 
finger 
at 
him, 
she 
left 
the 
room.

on 
the 
contrary 
reported 
that 
the
Russian 
army 
had 
been 
destroyed. 
Some 
talked 
about 
the 
Moscow 
militia
which, 
preceded 
by 
the 
clergy, 
would 
go 
to 
the 
Three 
Hills; 
others
whispered 
that 
Augustin 
had

forbidden 
to

that

had
been

that 
the 
peasants 
were 
rioting 
and 
robbing 
people 
on 
their
way 
from 
Moscow, 
and 
so 
on. 
But 
all 
this 
was 
only 
talk; 
in 
reality
(though 
the 
Council 
of 
Fili, 
at 
which 
it 
was 
decided 
to 
abandon 
Moscow,
had 
not 
yet 
been 
held) 
both 
those 
who 
went 
away 
and 
those 
who 
remained
behind 
felt, 
though 
they 
did 
not<p>
show 
it, 
that 
Moscow 
would 
certainly
be 
abandoned, 
and 
that 
they 
ought 
to 
get 
away 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible 
and
save 
their 
belongings. 
It 
was 
felt 
that 
everything 
would 
suddenly 
break
up 
and 
change, 
but 
up 
to 
the 
first 
of 
September 
nothing 
had 
done 
so.
As 
a 
criminal 
who 
is 
being 
led 
to 
execution 
knows 
that 
he 
must 
die
immediately, 
but 
yet 
looks 
about 
him 
and<p>
straightens 
the<p>
cap 
that 
is
awry 
on 
his 
head,<p>
so 
Moscow 
involuntarily 
continued 
its 
wonted 
life,
though 
it 
knew 
that 
the 
time 
of 
its 
destruction 
was 
near 
when 
the
conditions 
of 
life 
to 
which<p>
its 
people 
were 
accustomed 
to 
submit 
would
be 
completely 
upset.

During 
the 
three 
days 
preceding 
the 
occupation 
of 
Moscow 
the 
whole
Rostov 
family 
was 
absorbed 
in 
various 
activities. 
The 
head 
of 
the
family, 
Count 
Ilya 
Rostov, 
continually 
drove 
about 
the 
city 
collecting
the 
current 
rumors 
from 
all 
sides 
and<p>
gave 
superficial 
and 
hasty 
orders
at 
home<p>
about 
the 
preparations 
for 
their 
departure.

The 
countess 
watched 
the 
things 
being 
packed, 
was 
dissatisfied 
with
everything, 
was 
constantly 
in 
pursuit 
of 
Petya 
who 
was 
always 
running
away 
from 
her, 
and 
was 
jealous 
of 
Natasha 
with 
whom 
he 
spent 
all 
his
time. 
Sonya 
alone 
directed 
the 
practical 
side 
of 
matters 
by 
getting
things 
packed. 
But 
of 
late 
Sonya 
had 
been 
particularly 
sad 
and 
silent.
Nicholas' 
letter 
in 
which 
he 
mentioned 
Princess 
Mary 
had<p>
elicited, 
in
her 
presence, 
joyous 
comments 
from 
the 
countess, 
who 
saw 
an 
intervention
of 
Providence 
in 
this 
meeting 
of 
the 
princess 
and 
Nicholas.

"I 
was 
never 
pleased 
at 
Bolkonski's 
engagement 
to 
Natasha," 
said 
the
countess,<p>
"but 
I 
always 
wanted 
Nicholas 
to 
marry 
the 
princess, 
and 
had 
a
presentiment 
that 
it 
would 
happen. 
What 
a 
good 
thing 
it 
would 
be!"

Sonya 
felt 
that 
this 
was 
true: 
that 
the 
only 
possibility 
of 
retrieving
the 
Rostovs' 
affairs 
was 
by 
Nicholas 
marrying 
a 
rich 
woman, 
and 
that 
the
princess 
was 
a 
good 
match. 
It 
was 
very 
bitter 
for 
her. 
But 
despite
her 
grief,<p>
or 
perhaps 
just 
because 
of 
it, 
she 
took 
on 
herself 
all 
the
difficult 
work 
of 
directing<p>
the 
storing 
and 
packing 
of 
their 
things 
and
was 
busy 
for 
whole 
days. 
The 
count 
and 
countess 
turned 
to 
her 
when 
they
had 
any 
orders 
to 
give. 
Petya 
and 
Natasha 
on 
the 
contrary, 
far 
from
helping 
their 
parents, 
were 
generally 
a 
nuisance 
and 
a 
hindrance 
to
everyone. 
Almost 
all 
day 
long 
the 
house 
resounded 
with 
their 
running
feet, 
their 
cries, 
and 
their 
spontaneous 
laughter. 
They 
laughed 
and 
were
gay 
not 
because 
there 
was 
any 
reason 
to 
laugh, 
but 
because 
gaiety 
and
mirth 
were 
in 
their 
hearts 
and 
so 
everything 
that 
happened 
was 
a 
cause
for 
gaiety<p>
and 
laughter 
to 
them. 
Petya 
was 
in 
high 
spirits 
because
having 
left 
home 
a 
boy 
he 
had 
returned 
(as 
everybody 
told 
him) 
a 
fine
young 
man, 
because 
he 
was 
at 
home, 
because 
he 
had 
left 
Belaya 
Tserkov
where 
there 
was 
no 
hope 
of 
soon 
taking 
part 
in 
a 
battle 
and 
had 
come 
to
Moscow 
where 
there 
was 
to 
be 
fighting 
in 
a 
few 
days, 
and 
chiefly 
because
Natasha, 
whose 
lead 
he 
always 
followed, 
was 
in 
high 
spirits. 
Natasha 
was
gay 
because 
she 
had 
been 
sad 
too 
long 
and 
now 
nothing 
reminded 
her 
of
the 
cause 
of 
her 
sadness, 
and 
because 
she 
was 
feeling 
well. 
She 
was 
also
happy 
because 
she 
had 
someone<p>
to 
adore 
her: 
the 
adoration 
of 
others 
was
a 
lubricant 
the 
wheels 
of 
her 
machine 
needed 
to 
make 
them 
run 
freely-and
Petya 
adored 
her.

thing 
of 
you, 
cousin," 
she 
went 
on, 
"arrange 
for 
me 
to 
be 
taken 
to
Petersburg. 
Whatever 
I 
may 
be, 
I 
can't 
live 
under 
Bonaparte's 
rule."

"Oh, 
come, 
ma 
cousine! 
Where 
do 
you 
get 
your 
information 
from? 
On 
the
contrary..."

"I 
won't 
submit 
to 
your 
Napoleon! 
Others 
may 
if 
they 
please.... 
If 
you
don't 
want 
to 
do 
this..."

"But 
I 
will, 
I'll 
give 
the 
order 
at 
once."

The 
princess 
was 
apparently 
vexed 
at 
not 
having 
anyone 
to 
be 
angry 
with.
Muttering 
to 
herself, 
she 
sat 
down 
on 
a 
chair.

"But 
you 
have 
been 
misinformed," 
said 
Pierre. 
"Everything 
is 
quiet 
in
the 
city 
and 
there 
is 
not 
the 
slightest 
danger. 
See! 
I've 
just 
been
reading..." 
He 
showed 
her 
the 
broadsheet. 
"Count 
Rostopchin 
writes 
that
he 
will 
stake 
his 
life 
on 
it 
that 
the 
enemy 
will 
not 
enter 
Moscow."

"Oh, 
that 
count 
of 
yours!" 
said 
the 
princess 
malevolently. 
"He 
is 
a
hypocrite, 
a 
rascal 
who 
has 
himself 
roused 
the 
people 
to 
riot. 
Didn't
he 
write 
in 
those 
idiotic 
broadsheets 
that 
anyone, 
'whoever 
it 
might 
be,
should 
be 
dragged 
to 
the 
lockup 
by 
his 
hair'? 
(How 
silly!) 
'And 
honor
and 
glory 
to 
whoever 
captures 
him,' 
he 
says. 
This 
is 
what 
his 
cajolery
has 
brought 
us 
to! 
Barbara 
Ivanovna 
told 
me 
the 
mob 
near 
killed 
her
because 
she 
said 
something 
in 
French."

"Oh, 
but 
it's 
so... 
You 
take 
everything 
so 
to 
heart," 
said 
Pierre, 
and
began 
laying 
out 
his 
cards 
for 
patience.

Although 
that 
patience 
did 
come 
out, 
Pierre 
did 
not 
join 
the 
army,
but 
remained 
in 
deserted 
Moscow 
ever 
in 
the 
same 
state 
of 
agitation,
irresolution, 
and 
alarm, 
yet 
at 
the 
same 
time 
joyfully 
expecting
something 
terrible.

Next 
day 
toward 
evening 
the 
princess 
set 
off, 
and 
Pierre's 
head 
steward
came 
to 
inform 
him 
that 
the 
money 
needed 
for 
the 
equipment 
of 
his
regiment 
could 
not 
be 
found 
without 
selling 
one 
of 
the 
estates. 
In
general 
the 
head 
steward 
made 
out 
to 
Pierre 
that 
his 
project 
of 
raising
a 
regiment 
would 
ruin 
him. 
Pierre 
listened 
to 
him, 
scarcely 
able 
to
repress 
a 
smile.

"Well 
then, 
sell 
it," 
said 
he. 
"What's 
to 
be 
done? 
I 
can't 
draw 
back
now!"

The 
worse 
everything 
became, 
especially 
his 
own 
affairs, 
the 
better
was<p>
Pierre 
pleased 
and 
the 
more 
evident 
was<p>
it 
that 
the 
catastrophe 
he
expected 
was 
approaching. 
Hardly 
anyone 
he 
knew 
was 
left 
in 
town. 
Julie
had 
gone, 
and 
so 
had 
Princess 
Mary. 
Of 
his 
intimate 
friends 
only 
the
Rostovs 
remained, 
but 
he 
did 
not 
go 
to 
see 
them.

To 
distract 
his 
thoughts 
he 
drove 
that 
day 
to 
the 
village 
of 
Vorontsovo
to 
see 
the 
great 
balloon 
Leppich 
was 
constructing 
to 
destroy 
the 
foe,
and 
a 
trial 
<a href="/aVzUge/jE3A9PFi4byQW.html">balloon</a> 
that 
was 
to 
go 
up 
next 
day. 
The 
balloon 
was 
not 
yet
ready, 
but 
Pierre 
learned 
that 
it 
was 
being 
constructed 
by 
the 
Emperor's
desire. 
The 
Emperor 
had 
written 
to 
Count 
Rostopchin 
as 
follows:

As 
soon 
as 
Leppich 
is 
ready, 
get 
together 
a 
crew 
of 
reliable 
and
intelligent 
men 
for 
his 
car 
and 
send 
a 
courier 
to 
General 
Kutuzov 
to 
let
him 
know. 
I 
have 
informed 
him 
of 
the 
matter.

Please 
impress 
upon 
Leppich 
to 
be 
very 
careful 
where 
he 
descends 
for
the 
first 
time, 
that 
he 
may 
not 
make 
a 
mistake 
and 
fall 
into 
the 
enemy's
hands. 
It 
is 
essential 
for 
him 
to 
combine 
his 
movements 
with 
those 
of
the 
commander 
in 
chief.


On 
his 
way 
home 
from 
Vorontsovo, 
as 
he 
was 
passing 
the 
Bolotnoe 
Place
Pierre, 
seeing 
a 
large 
crowd<p>
round 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/kp76v8dkSm.html">Lobnoe</a> 
Place, 
stopped 
and 
got 
out
of 
his 
trap. 
A 
French 
cook 
accused 
of 
being 
a 
spy 
was 
being 
flogged. 
The
flogging 
was 
only 
just 
over, 
and 
the 
executioner 
was 
releasing 
from 
the
flogging

treat

In

the

There 
are 
four
hundred? 
Eh?" 
he 
asked, 
turning 
to 
the 
assistant.

The 
assistant 
looked 
fagged 
out. 
He 
was 
evidently 
vexed 
and 
impatient
for 
the 
talkative 
doctor 
to 
go.

"Major 
Denisov," 
Rostov 
said 
again. 
"He 
was 
wounded 
at
Molliten."

"Dead, 
I 
fancy. 
Eh, 
Makeev?" 
queried 
the 
doctor, 
in 
a 
tone 
of
indifference.

The 
assistant, 
however, 
did 
not 
confirm 
the 
doctor's 
words.

"Is 
he 
tall 
and 
with 
reddish 
hair?" 
asked 
the 
doctor.

Rostov 
described 
Denisov's 
appearance.

"There 
was 
one 
like 
that," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
as 
if 
pleased. 
"That
one 
is 
dead, 
I 
fancy. 
However, 
I'll 
look 
up 
our 
list. 
We 
had 
a 
list.
Have 
you 
got 
it, 
Makeev?"

"Makar 
Alexeevich 
has 
the 
list," 
answered 
the 
assistant. 
"But 
if
you'll 
step 
into 
the 
officers' 
wards 
you'll 
see 
for 
yourself,"
he 
added, 
turning 
to 
Rostov.

"Ah, 
you'd 
better 
not 
go, 
sir," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
"or 
you 
may
have 
to 
stay 
here 
yourself."

But 
Rostov 
bowed 
himself 
away 
from 
the 
doctor 
and 
asked 
the 
assistant
to 
show 
him 
the 
way.

"Only 
don't 
blame 
me!" 
the<p>
doctor 
shouted 
up 
after 
him.

Rostov 
and 
the 
assistant 
went 
into 
the 
dark 
corridor. 
The 
smell 
was 
so
strong 
there 
that 
Rostov 
held 
his 
nose 
and 
had 
to 
pause 
and 
collect
his 
strength 
before 
he 
could 
go 
on. 
A 
door 
opened 
to 
the 
right, 
and 
an
emaciated 
sallow 
man 
on 
crutches, 
barefoot 
and 
in 
underclothing, 
limped
out 
and, 
leaning 
against 
the 
doorpost, 
looked 
with 
glittering 
envious
eyes 
at 
those 
who 
were 
passing. 
Glancing 
in 
at 
the 
door, 
Rostov
saw 
that 
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
floor 
on 
straw 
and
overcoats.

"May 
I 
go 
in 
and 
look?"

"What 
is 
there 
to 
see?" 
said 
the 
assistant.

But, 
just 
because 
the 
assistant 
evidently 
did 
not 
want 
him 
to 
go 
in,
Rostov 
entered 
the 
soldiers' 
ward. 
The 
foul 
air, 
to 
which 
he 
had
already 
begun 
to 
get 
used 
in 
the 
corridor, 
was 
still 
stronger 
here. 
It
was 
a 
little 
different, 
more 
pungent, 
and 
one 
felt 
that 
this 
was 
where
it 
originated.

In 
the 
long 
room, 
brightly 
lit 
up 
by 
the 
sun 
through 
the 
large 
windows,
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
lay 
in 
two 
rows 
with 
their 
heads 
to 
the 
walls, 
and
leaving 
a 
passage 
in 
the 
middle. 
Most 
of 
them 
were 
unconscious 
and
paid 
no 
attention 
to 
the 
newcomers. 
Those 
who 
were 
conscious 
raised
themselves 
or 
lifted 
their 
thin 
yellow 
faces, 
and 
all 
looked 
intently 
at
Rostov 
with 
the

expression 
of 
hope,

thought 
Pierre, 
glancing 
at 
those 
dazzling
shoulders 
close 
to 
his 
eyes.

Or 
he 
would 
suddenly 
feel 
ashamed 
of 
he 
knew 
not 
what. 
He 
felt 
it
awkward 
to 
attract 
everyone's 
attention 
and 
to 
be 
considered 
a
lucky 
man 
and, 
with 
his 
plain 
face, 
to 
be 
looked 
on 
as 
a 
sort 
of 
Paris
possessed 
of 
a 
Helen. 
"But 
no 
doubt 
it 
always 
is 
and 
must 
be 
so!"
he 
consoled 
himself. 
"And 
besides, 
what 
have 
I 
done 
to 
bring 
it 
about?
How 
did 
it 
begin? 
I 
traveled 
from 
Moscow 
with 
Prince 
Vasili. 
Then 
there
was 
nothing. 
So 
why 
should 
I 
not 
stay 
at 
his 
house? 
Then 
I 
played 
cards
with 
her 
and 
picked 
up 
her 
reticule 
and 
drove 
out 
with 
her. 
How 
did 
it
begin, 
when 
did 
it 
all 
come 
about?" 
And 
here 
he 
was 
sitting 
by 
her
side 
as 
her 
betrothed, 
seeing, 
hearing, 
feeling 
her 
nearness, 
her
breathing, 
her 
movements, 
her 
beauty. 
Then 
it 
would 
suddenly 
seem 
to 
him
that 
it 
was 
not 
she 
but 
he 
was 
so 
unusually 
beautiful, 
and 
that 
that 
was
why 
they 
all 
looked 
so 
at 
him, 
and 
flattered 
by 
this 
general 
admiration
he 
would 
expand 
his 
chest, 
raise 
his 
head, 
and<p>
rejoice 
at 
his 
good
fortune. 
Suddenly 
he 
heard 
a 
familiar 
voice 
repeating 
something 
to 
him 
a
second 
time. 
But 
Pierre 
was 
so 
absorbed 
that 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
what
was 
said.

"I 
am 
asking 
you 
when 
you 
last 
heard 
from 
Bolkonski," 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili 
a 
third 
time. 
"How 
absent-minded 
you 
are, 
my 
dear
fellow."

Prince 
Vasili 
smiled, 
and 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
everyone 
was 
smiling 
at
him 
and 
Helene. 
"Well, 
what 
of 
it, 
if 
you 
all 
know 
it?" 
thought
Pierre. 
"What 
of 
it? 
It's 
the 
truth!" 
and 
he 
himself 
smiled 
his
gentle 
childlike 
smile, 
and 
Helene 
smiled 
too.

"When 
did 
you 
get 
the 
letter? 
Was 
it 
from 
Olmuetz?" 
repeated
Prince 
Vasili, 
who 
pretended 
to 
want 
to 
know 
this 
in<p>
order 
to 
settle 
a
dispute.

"How 
can 
one 
talk 
or 
think 
of 
such 
trifles?" 
thought 
Pierre.

"Yes, 
from 
Olmuetz,"<p>
he 
answered, 
with 
a

After 
supper 
Pierre 
with 
his 
partner 
followed 
the 
others 
into 
the
drawing 
room. 
The 
guests 
began 
to 
disperse, 
some 
without 
taking 
leave
of 
Helene. 
Some, 
as 
if 
unwilling 
to 
distract 
her 
from 
an 
important
occupation, 
came 
up 
to 
her 
for 
a 
moment 
and 
made 
haste 
to 
go 
away,
refusing 
to 
let 
her 
see 
them 
off. 
The 
diplomatist 
preserved 
a 
mournful
silence 
as 
he 
left 
the 
drawing 
room. 
He 
pictured 
the 
vanity 
of 
his
diplomatic 
career 
in 
comparison 
with 
Pierre's 
happiness. 
The 
old
general 
grumbled 
at 
his 
wife 
when 
she 
asked 
how 
his 
leg 
was. 
"Oh, 
the
old 
fool," 
he 
thought. 
"That 
Princess 
Helene 
will 
be 
beautiful
still 
when 
she's 
fifty."

"I 
think 
I 
may 
congratulate 
you," 
whispered 
Anna 
Pavlovna 
to 
the
old 
princess, 
kissing 
her 
soundly. 
"If 
I 
hadn't 
this 
headache 
I'd
have 
stayed 
longer."

The 
old 
princess 
did 
not 
reply, 
she 
was 
tormented 
by 
jealousy 
of 
her
daughter's 
happiness.

While 
the 
guests 
were 
taking 
their 
leave 
Pierre 
remained 
for 
a 
long 
time
alone 
with 
Helene 
in 
the 
little 
drawing 
room 
where 
they 
were 
sitting.
He 
had 
often 
before, 
during 
the 
last 
six 
weeks, 
remained 
alone 
with 
her,
but 
had 
never 
spoken 
to 
her 
of 
love. 
Now 
he 
felt 
that 
it 
was 
inevitable,
but 
he 
could 
not 
make 
up 
his 
mind 
to 
take 
the 
final 
step. 
He 
felt
ashamed; 
he 
felt 
that 
he<p>
was 
occupying 
someone 
else's 
place 
here
beside 
Helene. 
"This 
happiness 
is 
not 
for 
you," 
some 
inner 
voice
whispered 
to 
him. 
"This 
happiness 
is 
for 
those 
who 
have 
not 
in 
them
what 
there 
is 
in 
you."

But, 
as 
he 
had 
to 
say 
something, 
he 
began

CHAPTER 
VIII

One 
would 
have 
thought 
that 
under 
the 
almost 
incredibly 
wretched
conditions 
the 
Russian 
soldiers 
were 
in 
at 
that 
time-lacking 
warm 
boots
and 
sheepskin 
coats, 
without 
a 
<a href="/cZl/RG4i8J0A.html">roof</a> 
over 
their 
heads, 
in 
the 
snow
with 
eighteen 
degrees 
of 
frost, 
and 
without 
even 
full 
rations 
(the
commissariat 
did 
not 
always 
keep 
up 
with 
the 
troops)-they 
would 
have
presented 
a 
very 
<a href="/cZl/CK3YIp8qRU2.html">sad</a> 
and 
depressing 
spectacle.

On 
the 
contrary, 
the 
army 
had 
never 
under 
the 
best 
material 
conditions
presented 
a 
more 
cheerful 
and 
animated 
aspect. 
This 
was 
because 
all 
who
began 
to 
grow 
depressed 
or 
who 
lost 
strength 
were 
sifted 
out 
of 
the 
army
day 
by 
day. 
All 
the 
physically 
or 
morally 
weak 
had 
long 
since 
been 
left
behind 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/cF9JCLL4k6.html">only</a> 
the 
flower 
of 
the 
army-physically 
and 
mentally-remained.

More 
men 
collected 
behind 
the 
wattle 
fence 
of 
the 
Eighth 
Company 
than
anywhere 
else. 
Two 
sergeants 
major 
were 
sitting 
<a href="/cZl/Qz4XZEHJ3wvJ1Sdo.html">with</a> 
them 
and 
their
campfire 
blazed 
brighter 
than 
others. 
For 
leave 
to 
sit 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cp7Ufz6ClqSz.html">by</a> 
their 
wattle
they 
demanded 
contributions 
of 
fuel.

"Eh, 
Makeev! 
What 
has 
become 
of 
you, 
you 
son 
of 
a 
bitch? 
Are 
you 
lost 
or
have 
the 
wolves 
eaten 
you? 
Fetch 
some 
more 
wood!" 
shouted 
a 
red-haired
and 
red-faced 
man, 
screwing 
up 
his 
eyes 
and 
blinking 
because 
of 
the
smoke 
but 
not 
moving 
back 
from 
the 
fire. 
"And 
you, 
Jackdaw, 
go 
and 
fetch
some 
wood!" 
said 
he 
to 
another 
soldier.

This 
red-haired 
man 
was 
neither 
a 
sergeant 
nor 
a 
corporal, 
but 
being
robust 
he 
ordered 
about 
those 
weaker 
than 
himself. 
The 
soldier
they 
called 
"Jackdaw," 
a 
thin 
little 
fellow 
with 
a 
sharp 
nose, 
rose
obediently 
and 
was 
about 
to 
go 
but 
at 
that 
instant 
there 
came 
into
the 
light 
of 
the 
fire 
the 
slender, 
handsome 
figure 
of 
a 
young 
soldier
carrying 
a 
load 
of 
wood.

"Bring 
it 
here-that's 
fine!"

They 
split 
up 
the 
wood, 
pressed 
it 
down 
on 
the 
fire, 
blew 
at 
it 
with
their 
mouths, 
and 
fanned 
it 
with 
the 
skirts 
of 
their 
greatcoats, 
making
the 
flames 
hiss 
and 
crackle. 
The 
men 
drew 
nearer 
and 
lit 
their 
pipes.
The 
handsome 
young 
soldier 
who 
had 
brought 
the 
wood, 
setting 
his 
arms
akimbo, 
began 
stamping 
his 
cold 
feet 
rapidly 
and 
deftly 
on 
the 
spot
where 
he 
stood.

"Mother! 
The 
dew 
is 
cold 
but 
clear.... 
It's 
well 
that 
I'm

sang,

to 
hiccough

commander 
the

in 
comparison 
with 
others 
that
had 
reached 
Braunau 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
was 
in 
splendid 
condition. 
There
were 
only 
217 
sick 
and 
stragglers. 
Everything 
was 
in 
good 
order 
except
the 
boots.

Kutuzov 
walked 
through 
the 
ranks, 
sometimes 
stopping 
to 
say 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/OH80CyE7uR.html">few
friendly</a> 
words 
to 
officers 
he 
had 
known 
in 
the 
Turkish 
war, 
sometimes
also 
to 
the 
soldiers. 
Looking 
at 
their 
boots 
he 
several 
times 
shook 
his
head 
sadly, 
pointing 
them 
out 
to 
the 
Austrian 
general 
with 
an 
expression
which 
seemed 
to 
say 
that 
he 
was 
not 
blaming 
anyone, 
but 
could 
not 
help
noticing<p>
what 
a 
bad 
state 
of 
things 
it 
was. 
The 
regimental 
commander
ran 
forward 
on 
each 
such 
occasion, 
fearing 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">miss</a> 
a 
single 
word 
of 
the
commander 
in 
chief's 
regarding 
the 
regiment. 
Behind 
Kutuzov, 
at 
a
distance 
that 
allowed 
every 
softly 
spoken 
word 
to 
be 
heard, 
followed
some 
twenty 
men 
of 
his 
suite. 
These 
gentlemen 
talked 
among 
themselves
and 
sometimes 
laughed. 
Nearest 
of 
all 
to 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
walked
a 
handsome 
adjutant. 
This 
was 
Prince 
Bolkonski. 
Beside 
him 
was 
his
comrade 
Nesvitski, 
a 
tall 
staff 
officer, 
extremely 
stout, 
with 
a
kindly, 
smiling, 
handsome 
face 
and 
moist 
eyes. 
Nesvitski 
could 
hardly
keep 
from 
laughter 
provoked 
by 
a 
swarthy 
hussar 
officer 
who 
walked
beside 
him. 
This 
hussar, 
with 
a 
grave 
face 
and 
without 
a 
smile 
or 
a
change 
in 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
fixed 
eyes, 
watched 
the 
regimental
commander's 
back 
and 
mimicked 
his 
every 
movement. 
Each 
time 
the
commander 
started 
and 
bent 
forward, 
the 
hussar 
started 
and 
bent 
forward
in 
exactly 
the 
same 
manner. 
Nesvitski 
laughed 
and 
nudged 
the 
others 
to
make 
them 
look 
at 
the 
wag.

Kutuzov 
walked 
slowly 
and 
languidly 
past 
thousands 
of 
eyes 
which 
were
starting 
from 
their 
sockets 
to 
watch 
their 
chief. 
On 
reaching 
the
third 
company 
he 
suddenly 
stopped. 
His 
suite, 
not 
having 
expected 
this,
involuntarily 
came 
closer 
to 
him.

"Ah, 
Timokhin!" 
said 
he, 
recognizing 
the 
red-nosed 
captain 
who 
had
been 
reprimanded 
on 
account 
of 
the 
blue 
greatcoat.

One 
would 
have 
thought 
it 
impossible 
for 
a 
man 
to 
stretch 
himself
more 
than 
Timokhin 
had 
done 
when 
he 
was 
reprimanded 
by 
the 
regimental
commander, 
but 
now 
that 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
addressed 
him 
he 
drew
himself 
up 
to 
such 
an 
extent 
that 
it 
seemed 
he 
could 
not 
have 
sustained

commander

Kutuzov,

his 
case 
and 
wished 
him 
nothing

good,
quickly 
turned 
away, 
a 
scarcely

over 
his

face.

"Another

he. 
"A

the

began 
irresolutely

admonish 
Nicholas 
and 
beg 
him

Nicholas 
replied 
that

his

sighing 
and 
evidently 
disconcerted, 
very<p>
soon 
became 
silent 
and
went 
in 
to 
the 
countess. 
In 
all 
his 
encounters 
with 
his 
son, 
the 
count
was 
always 
conscious 
of 
his 
own 
guilt 
toward 
him 
for 
having 
wasted 
the
family 
fortune, 
and 
so 
he 
could 
not 
be 
angry 
with 
him 
for 
refusing 
to
marry 
an 
heiress 
and 
choosing 
the 
dowerless 
Sonya. 
On 
this 
occasion, 
he
was 
only 
more 
vividly 
conscious 
of 
the 
fact 
that<p>
if 
his 
affairs 
had 
not
been 
in 
disorder, 
no 
better 
wife 
for 
Nicholas 
than 
Sonya 
could 
have
been 
wished 
for, 
and 
that 
no 
one 
but 
himself 
with 
his 
Mitenka 
and
his 
uncomfortable 
habits 
was 
to 
blame 
for 
the 
condition 
of 
the 
family
finances.

The 
father 
and 
mother 
did 
not 
speak 
of 
the 
matter 
to 
their 
son 
again,
but 
a 
few 
days 
later 
the 
countess 
sent 
for 
Sonya 
and, 
with 
a<p>
cruelty
neither 
of 
them 
expected, 
reproached 
her 
niece 
for 
trying 
to 
catch
Nicholas 
and 
for 
ingratitude. 
Sonya 
listened 
silently 
with 
downcast
eyes 
to 
the 
countess' 
cruel 
words, 
without 
understanding 
what
was

of 
her. 
She 
was 
ready 
to 
sacrifice 
everything 
for 
her
benefactors. 
Self-sacrifice 
was 
her 
most 
cherished 
idea 
but 
in 
this 
case
she 
could 
not 
see 
what 
she 
ought 
to 
sacrifice, 
or 
for 
whom.<p>
She 
could
not 
help 
loving 
the 
countess 
and 
the 
whole 
Rostov 
family, 
but 
neither
could 
she 
help 
loving 
Nicholas 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk8MCK3bju5WkvgW.html">knowing</a> 
that 
his 
happiness 
depended
on 
that

She 
was 
silent

sad

did 
not

Nicholas 
felt
the 
situation 
to 
be 
intolerable 
and 
went 
to 
have 
an 
explanation 
with 
his
mother. 
He 
first 
implored 
her 
to 
forgive 
him 
and 
Sonya 
and 
consent 
to
their 
marriage, 
then 
he 
threatened 
that 
if 
she 
molested 
Sonya 
he 
would
at 
once 
marry 
her 
secretly.

The 
countess, 
with 
a 
coldness 
her 
<a href="/cZl/ml3HQTp6AbiHP2.html">son</a> 
had 
never 
seen 
in 
her

replied 
that 
he 
was 
of 
age, 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
marrying 
without 
his
father's 
consent, 
and 
he 
could 
do 
the 
same, 
but 
that 
she 
would 
never
receive 
that 
intriguer 
as 
her 
daughter.

Exploding 
at 
the 
word 
intriguer, 
Nicholas, 
raising 
his 
voice, 
told
his 
mother 
he 
had 
never 
expected 
her 
to 
try 
to 
force 
him 
to 
sell 
his
feelings, 
but 
if 
that 
were 
so, 
he 
would 
say 
for 
the 
last 
time.... 
But 
he
had 
no 
time 
to 
utter 
the 
decisive 
word 
which 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
face
caused 
his 
mother 
to 
await 
with 
terror, 
and 
which 
would 
perhaps 
have
forever 
remained 
a 
cruel 
memory 
to 
them 
both. 
He 
had 
not 
time 
to 
say 
it,
for 
Natasha, 
with 
a 
pale 
and 
set 
face, 
entered 
the 
room 
from 
the 
door
at 
which 
she 
had 
been 
listening.

"Nicholas, 
you 
are 
talking 
nonsense! 
Be 
quiet, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Sn3Cv08na.html">be</a> 
quiet, 
be 
quiet, 
I
tell 
you!..." 
she 
almost 
screamed, 
so 
as 
to 
drown 
his 
voice.

"Mamma 
darling, 
it's 
not 
at 
all 
so... 
my 
poor, 
sweet 
darling," 
she
said 
to 
her 
mother, 
who 
conscious 
that 
they 
had 
been 
on 
the 
brink 
of
a 
rupture 
gazed 
at 
her 
son 
with 
terror, 
but 
in 
the 
obstinacy 
and
excitement 
of 
the 
conflict 
could 
not 
and 
would 
not 
give 
way.

"Nicholas, 
I'll 
explain 
to 
you. 
Go 
away! 
Listen, 
Mamma 
darling,"
said 
Natasha.

Her 
words 
were 
incoherent, 
but 
they 
attained<p>
the 
purpose 
at 
which 
she
was 
aiming.

The 
countess, 
sobbing 
heavily, 
hid 
her 
face 
on 
her 
daughter's 
breast,
while 
Nicholas 
rose, 
clutching 
his 
head, 
and 
left 
the 
room.

Natasha 
set 
to 
work 
to 
effect 
a 
reconciliation, 
and 
so 
<a href="/aVzUge/AX3C8Ook0o.html">far</a> 
succeeded
that 
Nicholas 
received 
a 
promise 
from 
his 
mother 
that 
Sonya 
should 
<a href="/aVzUge/zl7Dj1WG1yxat.html">not

troubled, 
while 
he 
on 
his 
side 
promised 
not 
to

anything
without 
his 
parents' 
knowledge.

Firmly 
resolved, 
after 
putting 
his 
affairs 
in 
order 
in 
the 
regiment,
to 
retire 
from 
the 
army 
and 
return 
and 
marry 
Sonya, 
Nicholas, 
serious,
sorrowful, 
and 
at 
variance 
with 
his 
parents, 
but, 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
him,
passionately 
in 
love, 
left 
at 
the 
beginning 
of 
January

Though

the 
Gospel 
must 
be
understood 
differently, 
yet 
looking 
at

she 
agreed 
with 
Natasha's
explanation. 
It 
really 
seemed 
that 
Sonya 
did 
not 
feel 
her 
position
trying, 
and 
had 
grown 
quite 
reconciled 
to 
her 
lot 
as 
a 
sterile 
flower.
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
fond 
not 
so 
much 
of 
individuals 
as 
of 
the 
family 
as 
a
whole. 
Like 
a 
cat, 
she 
had 
attached 
herself 
not 
to 
the 
people 
but 
to 
the
home. 
She 
waited 
on 
the 
old 
countess, 
petted 
and 
spoiled 
the 
children,
was 
always 
ready 
to 
render 
the 
small 
services 
for 
which 
she 
had 
a 
gift,
and 
all 
this 
was 
unconsciously 
accepted 
from 
her 
with 
insufficient
gratitude.

The 
country<p>
seat 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
had 
been 
rebuilt, 
though 
not 
on 
the 
same
scale 
as 
under 
the 
old 
prince.

The 
buildings, 
begun 
under 
straitened 
circumstances, 
were 
more 
than
simple. 
The 
immense 
house 
on 
the 
old 
stone 
foundations 
was 
of 
wood,
plastered 
only 
inside. 
It 
had 
bare 
deal 
floors 
and 
was 
furnished 
with
very 
simple 
hard 
sofas, 
armchairs, 
tables, 
and 
chairs 
made 
by 
their 
own
serf 
carpenters 
out 
of 
their 
own 
birchwood. 
The 
house 
was 
spacious
and 
had 
rooms 
for 
the 
house<p>
serfs 
and 
apartments 
for 
visitors. 
Whole
families 
of 
the 
Rostovs' 
and 
Bolkonskis' 
relations 
sometimes 
came 
to
Bald 
Hills 
with 
sixteen 
horses 
and 
dozens 
of 
servants 
and 
stayed 
for
months. 
Besides 
that, 
four 
times 
a 
year, 
on 
the 
name 
days 
and 
birthdays
of 
the 
hosts, 
as 
many 
as 
a 
hundred 
visitors 
would 
gather 
there 
for 
a 
day
or 
two. 
The 
rest 
of 
the

life 
pursued 
its 
unbroken 
routine 
with 
its

CHAPTER 
IX

It 
was 
the 
eve 
of 
St. 
Nicholas, 
the 
fifth 
of 
December, 
1820. 
Natasha 
had
been 
staying 
at 
her 
brother's 
with 
her 
husband 
and 
children 
since 
early
autumn. 
Pierre 
had 
gone 
to 
Petersburg 
on 
business 
of 
his 
own 
for 
three
weeks 
as 
he 
said, 
but 
had 
remained 
there 
nearly 
seven 
weeks 
and 
was
expected 
back 
every 
minute.

Besides 
the 
Bezukhov 
family, 
Nicholas' 
old 
friend 
the 
retired 
General
Vasili 
Dmitrich 
Denisov 
was 
staying 
with 
the 
Rostovs 
this 
fifth 
of
December.

On 
the 
sixth, 
which 
was 
his 
name 
day 
when 
the 
house 
would 
be 
full 
of
visitors, 
Nicholas 
knew 
he 
would 
have 
to 
exchange 
his 
Tartar 
tunic 
for
a 
tail 
coat, 
and 
put 
on 
narrow 
boots 
with<p>
pointed 
toes, 
and 
drive 
to
the 
new 
church 
he 
had 
built, 
and 
then 
receive 
visitors 
who 
would 
come 
to
congratulate 
him, 
offer 
them 
refreshments, 
and 
talk 
about 
the 
elections
of 
the 
nobility; 
but 
he 
considered 
himself 
entitled 
to 
spend 
the 
eve
of 
that 
day 
in 
his 
usual 
way. 
He 
examined 
the 
bailiff's 
accounts 
of
the 
village 
in 
Ryazan 
which 
<a href="/cZl/Zdn31xHdu.html">belonged</a> 
to 
his 
wife's 
nephew, 
wrote 
two
business 
letters,

CHAPTER 
XVI

Kutuzov 
accompanied 
by 
his 
adjutants 
rode 
at 
a 
walking 
pace 
behind<p>
the
carabineers.

When 
he 
had 
gone 
less 
than 
half 
a 
mile 
in 
the 
rear 
of 
the 
column 
he
stopped 
at 
a 
solitary, 
deserted 
house 
that 
had 
probably 
once 
been 
an
inn, 
where 
two 
roads 
parted. 
Both 
of 
them 
led 
downhill 
and 
troops 
were
marching 
along 
both.

The 
fog 
had 
begun 
to 
clear 
and 
enemy 
troops 
were 
already 
dimly 
visible
about 
a 
mile 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/fh7Z0CKY5iw.html">and</a> 
a 
half 
off 
on 
the 
opposite 
heights. 
Down 
below, 
on
the 
left, 
the 
firing 
became 
more 
distinct. 
Kutuzov 
had 
stopped 
and 
was
speaking 
to 
an 
Austrian 
general. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
was 
a 
little 
behind
looking 
at 
them, 
turned 
to 
an 
adjutant 
to 
ask 
him 
for 
a 
field 
glass.

"Look, 
look!" 
said 
this 
adjutant, 
looking 
not 
at 
the 
troops 
in 
the
distance, 
but 
down 
the 
hill 
<a href="/aVzUge/lnA2Q68tvrb.html">before</a> 
him. 
"It's 
the 
French!"

The 
two 
generals 
and 
the 
adjutant 
took 
hold 
of 
the 
field 
glass, 
trying
to 
snatch 
it 
from 
one 
another. 
The 
expression 
on 
all 
their 
faces
suddenly 
changed 
to 
one 
of 
horror. 
The 
French 
were 
supposed 
to 
be 
a
mile 
and 
a 
half 
away, 
but 
had 
suddenly 
and 
unexpectedly 
appeared 
just 
in
front 
of 
us.

"It's 
the 
enemy?... 
No!... 
Yes, 
see 
it 
is!... 
for 
certain.... 
But
how 
is 
that?" 
said 
different 
voices.

With 
the 
naked 
eye 
Prince 
Andrew 
saw 
below 
them 
to 
the 
right, 
<a href="/aVzUge/qB20YmejJ3qrOH.html">not</a> 
more
than 
five 
hundred 
paces 
from 
where 
Kutuzov 
was 
standing, 
a 
dense 
French
column 
coming 
up 
to 
meet 
the 
Apsherons.

"Here 
it 
is! 
The 
decisive 
moment 
has 
arrived. 
My 
turn 
has 
come,"
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and 
striking 
his 
horse 
he 
rode 
up 
to 
Kutuzov.

"The 
Apsherons 
must 
be 
stopped, 
your 
excellency," 
cried 
he. 
But 
at
that 
very 
instant 
a 
cloud 
of 
smoke 
spread 
<a href="/aVzUge/mx1EnBVm2o0EoOV.html">all</a> 
round,

was

quite 
close 
at 
hand, 
and 
a 
voice 
of 
naive 
terror 
barely 
two 
steps 
from
Prince 
Andrew 
shouted, 
"Brothers! 
All's

the</h1>first 
of 
September 
when
the 
army 
drew 
near 
Moscow-despite 
the 
strength 
of 
the 
feeling 
that 
had
arisen 
in 
all 
ranks-the 
force 
of 
circumstances 
compelled 
it 
to 
retire

Moscow. 
And 
the<p>
troops 
retired 
one 
more, 
last, 
day's 
march, 
and
abandoned 
Moscow 
to 
the 
enemy.

For 
people 
accustomed 
to 
think 
that 
plans 
of 
campaign 
and 
battles 
are
made 
by 
generals-as 
anyone 
of 
us 
sitting 
over 
a 
map 
in 
his 
study 
may
imagine 
how 
he 
would 
have 
arranged 
things 
in 
this 
or 
that 
battle-the
questions 
present 
themselves: 
Why 
did 
Kutuzov 
during 
the 
retreat 
not 
do
this 
or 
that? 
Why 
did 
he 
not 
take 
up 
a 
position 
before 
reaching 
Fili?
Why 
did 
he 
not 
retire 
at 
once 
by 
the 
Kaluga 
road, 
abandoning 
Moscow? 
and
so 
on. 
People 
accustomed 
to 
think 
in 
that 
way 
forget, 
or 
do 
not 
know,
the 
inevitable 
conditions 
which 
always 
limit 
the 
activities 
of 
any
commander 
in 
chief. 
The 
activity 
of 
a 
commander 
in 
chief 
does 
not 
at 
all
resemble 
the 
activity 
we 
imagine 
to 
ourselves 
when 
we 
sit 
at 
ease 
in
our 
studies 
examining 
some 
campaign 
on 
the 
map, 
with 
a 
certain 
number 
of
troops 
on 
this 
and 
that 
side 
in 
a 
certain 
known 
locality, 
and 
begin 
our
plans 
from 
some 
given 
moment. 
A 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
never 
dealing 
with
the 
beginning 
of 
any 
event-the 
position 
from 
which 
we 
always 
contemplate
it. 
The 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
always 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
a 
series 
of
shifting 
events 
and 
so 
he 
never 
can 
at 
any 
moment 
consider 
the 
whole
import 
of 
an 
event 
that 
is 
occurring. 
Moment 
by 
moment 
the 
event 
is
imperceptibly 
shaping 
itself, 
and 
at 
every 
moment 
of 
this 
continuous,
uninterrupted 
shaping 
of 
events 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
is 
in 
the
midst 
of 
a 
most 
complex 
play 
of 
intrigues, 
worries, 
contingencies,
authorities, 
projects, 
counsels, 
threats, 
and 
deceptions 
and 
is
continually 
obliged 
to 
reply 
to 
innumerable 
questions 
addressed 
to 
him,
which 
constantly 
conflict 
with 
one 
another.

Learned 
military 
authorities 
quite 
seriously 
tell 
us 
that 
Kutuzov 
should
have 
moved 
his 
army 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road 
long 
before 
reaching 
Fili, 
and
that 
somebody 
actually 
submitted 
such 
a 
proposal 
to 
him. 
But 
a 
commander
in 
chief, 
especially 
at 
a 
difficult 
moment, 
has 
always 
before 
him<p>
not
one 
proposal 
but 
dozens 
simultaneously. 
And 
all 
these 
proposals, 
based
on 
strategics 
and 
tactics, 
contradict 
each 
other.

A 
commander 
in 
chief's 
business, 
it 
would 
seem, 
is 
simply 
to 
choose 
one
of 
these 
projects. 
But 
even 
that 
he 
cannot 
do. 
Events 
and 
time 
do 
not
wait. 
For 
instance, 
on 
the 
twenty-eighth 
it 
is 
suggested 
to 
him 
to
cross 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road, 
but 
just 
then 
an 
adjutant 
gallops 
up 
from
Miloradovich 
asking 
whether 
he 
is 
to 
engage 
the 
French 
or 
retire. 
An
order 
must 
be 
given 
him 
at 
once, 
that 
instant. 
And<p>
the 
order 
to 
retreat
carries 
us 
past 
the 
turn 
to 
the 
Kaluga 
road. 
And 
after 
the 
adjutant
comes 
the 
commissary 
general 
asking 
where 
the 
stores 
are 
to 
be 
taken,
and 
the 
chief 
of 
the 
hospitals 
asks 
where 
the 
wounded 
are 
to 
go, 
and 
a
courier 
from 
Petersburg 
brings 
a 
letter<p>
from 
the 
sovereign 
which 
does

Pierre 
began</h1>with
self-satisfaction 
and 
enthusiasm,<p>
Natasha 
with 
a 
quiet, 
happy 
smile.
Having 
interrupted 
one 
another 
they 
both 
stopped 
to 
let 
the 
other
continue.

"No. 
What 
did 
you 
say? 
Go 
on, 
go 
on."

"No, 
you 
go 
on, 
I 
was 
talking 
nonsense," 
said 
Natasha.

Pierre 
finished 
what 
he 
had 
begun. 
It 
was 
the 
sequel 
to 
his 
complacent
reflections 
on 
his 
success 
in 
Petersburg. 
At 
that 
moment 
it 
seemed 
to
him 
that 
he 
was 
chosen 
to 
give 
a 
new 
direction 
to 
the 
whole 
of 
Russian
society 
and 
to 
the 
whole 
world.

"I 
only 
wished 
to 
say 
that 
ideas 
that 
have 
great 
results 
are 
always
simple 
ones. 
My 
whole 
idea 
is 
that 
if 
vicious 
people 
are 
united 
and
constitute 
a 
power, 
then 
honest 
folk 
must 
do 
the 
same. 
Now 
that's 
simple
enough."

"Yes."

"And 
what 
were 
you 
going 
to 
say?"

"I? 
Only 
nonsense."

"But 
all 
the 
same?"

"Oh 
nothing, 
only 
a 
trifle," 
said 
Natasha, 
smiling 
still 
more 
brightly.
"I 
only 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you

Petya: 
today 
nurse 
was 
coming 
to 
take
him 
from 
me, 
and 
he 
laughed, 
shut 
his 
eyes, 
and 
clung 
to 
me. 
I'm 
sure
he 
thought 
he 
was 
hiding. 
Awfully<p>
sweet! 
There, 
now 
he's 
crying. 
Well,
good-by!" 
and 
she<p>
left 
the 
room.


Meanwhile 
downstairs 
in 
young 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski's 
bedroom 
a 
little 
lamp
was 
burning 
as 
usual. 
(The 
boy 
was 
afraid 
of 
the 
dark 
and 
they 
could
not 
cure 
him 
of 
it.) 
Dessalles 
slept 
propped 
up 
on 
four 
pillows 
and 
his
Roman 
nose 
emitted 
sounds 
of 
rhythmic 
snoring. 
Little 
Nicholas, 
who 
had
just 
waked 
up 
in 
a<p>
cold 
perspiration, 
sat 
up 
in 
bed 
and 
gazed 
before 
him
with 
wide-open 
eyes. 
He 
had 
awaked 
from 
a 
terrible 
dream. 
He 
had 
dreamed
that 
he 
and 
Uncle 
Pierre, 
wearing 
helmets 
such 
as 
were 
depicted 
in
his 
Plutarch, 
were 
leading 
a 
huge 
army. 
The 
army 
was 
made 
up 
of 
white
slanting 
lines 
that 
filled 
the 
air 
like 
the 
cobwebs 
that 
float 
about 
in
autumn 
and 
which 
Dessalles 
called 
les 
fils 
de 
la 
Vierge. 
In 
front 
was
Glory, 
which 
was 
similar 
to 
those 
threads 
but 
rather 
thicker. 
He 
and
Pierre 
were 
borne 
along 
lightly 
and 
joyously, 
nearer 
and 
nearer 
to 
their
goal. 
Suddenly 
the 
threads 
that 
moved 
them 
began 
to 
slacken 
and 
become
entangled 
and 
it 
grew 
difficult 
to 
move. 
And 
Uncle 
Nicholas 
stood 
before
them 
in 
a 
stern 
and 
threatening 
attitude.

"Have 
you 
done 
this?" 
he 
said, 
pointing 
to 
some 
broken 
sealing 
wax 
and
pens. 
"I 
loved 
you, 
but 
I 
have 
orders 
from 
Arakcheev 
and 
will 
kill
the 
first 
of 
you 
who 
moves 
forward." 
Little 
Nicholas 
turned 
to 
look
at 
Pierre 
but 
Pierre 
was 
no 
longer 
there. 
In 
his 
place 
was 
his
father-Prince 
Andrew-and 
his 
father 
had 
neither 
shape 
nor 
form, 
but 
he
existed, 
and 
when 
little 
Nicholas 
perceived 
him 
he 
grew<p>
faint 
with 
love:
he 
felt 
himself 
powerless, 
limp, 
and 
formless. 
His 
father 
caressed 
and
pitied 
him. 
But 
Uncle 
Nicholas 
came 
nearer 
and 
nearer 
to 
them. 
Terror
seized 
young 
Nicholas 
and 
he 
awoke.

"My 
father!" 
he 
thought. 
(Though 
there 
were 
two 
good 
portraits 
of 
Prince
Andrew 
in 
the 
house, 
Nicholas 
never 
imagined 
him 
in 
human 
form.) 
"My
father 
has 
been 
with 
me 
and 
caressed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">me.</a> 
He 
approved 
of 
me 
and 
of 
Uncle
Pierre. 
Whatever 
he 
may 
tell 
me, 
I 
will 
do 
it. 
Mucius 
Scaevola 
burned
his 
hand. 
Why 
should 
not 
the 
same 
sort 
of 
thing 
happen 
to 
me? 
I 
know
they 
want 
me 
to 
learn. 
And 
I 
will 
learn. 
But 
someday 
I 
shall 
have
finished 
learning, 
and 
then 
I 
will 
do 
something. 
I 
only 
pray 
God 
that
something 
may 
happen 
to 
me 
such 
as 
happened 
to 
Plutarch's 
men, 
and 
I
will 
act 
as 
they 
did. 
I 
will 
do 
better. 
Everyone 
shall 
know 
me, 
love 
me,
and 
be 
delighted 
with 
me!" 
And 
suddenly 
his 
bosom 
heaved 
with 
sobs 
and
he 
began 
to 
cry.

"Are 
you 
ill?" 
he 
heard 
Dessalles' 
voice 
asking.

"No," 
answered 
Nicholas, 
and 
lay 
back 
on 
his 
pillow.

"He 
is 
good 
and 
kind 
and 
I 
am 
fond 
of 
him!" 
he 
thought 
of 
Dessalles.
"But 
Uncle 
Pierre! 
Oh, 
what 
a 
wonderful 
man 
he 
is! 
And 
my 
father? 
Oh,
Father, 
Father! 
Yes, 
I 
will 
do 
something 
with 
which 
even 
he 
would 
be
satisfied...."

All

asked 
Nicholas, 
riding 
a

paces 
toward
the 
whip

had

But 
before 
the

could

the 
hare, 
scenting 
the 
frost 
coming
next 
morning, 
was 
unable 
to 
rest 
and 
leaped 
up. 
The 
pack 
on 
leash 
rushed
downhill 
in 
full 
cry 
after 
the 
hare, 
and 
from

sides 
the 
borzois 
that
were 
not

darted 
after 
the 
hounds 
and 
the

All 
the 
hunt,
who 
had 
been 
moving 
slowly, 
shouted, 
"Stop!" 
calling 
in 
the 
hounds,
while 
the 
borzoi 
whips, 
with 
a 
cry 
of 
<a href="/cZl/NP2D1vf5ezc.html">"A-tu!"</a> 
galloped 
across 
the
field 
setting 
the 
borzois

the 
hare. 
The 
tranquil 
Ilagin, 
Nicholas,
Natasha,

how

A 
week 
after

the 
young 
Polish 
count,
Willarski, 
whom 
Pierre 
had 
known 
slightly 
in 
Petersburg 
society, 
came
into 
his 
room 
one 
evening 
in 
the 
official 
and 
ceremonious 
manner 
in
which 
Dolokhov's 
second 
had 
called 
on 
him,

having 
closed

door 
behind 
him 
and 
satisfied 
himself 
that 
there 
was 
nobody

addressed 
Pierre.

"I 
have 
come 
to 
you 
with<p>
a 
message

an

Count," 
he
said 
without 
sitting 
down. 
"A

The 
cold,

this

he 
had 
almost 
always

The 
great 
natural

lie 
outside 
us 
and 
we 
are 
not

we 
call

But 
just 
as 
the 
force 
of 
gravitation, 
incomprehensible 
in 
itself 
but
felt 
by 
every 
man, 
is 
understood 
by 
us

to 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
we
know 
the

of 
inevitability 
to 
which 
it 
is 
subject 
(from 
the 
first
knowledge 
that 
all 
bodies 
have 
weight, 
up 
to 
Newton's 
law), 
so 
too 
the
force 
of 
free 
will, 
incomprehensible 
in 
itself 
but 
of 
which 
everyone 
is

All

merely 
a

this

Man's

The 
forces

Just

the

distinguished 
by

from

Freedom,

laws 
of 
reason 
that

differs

In 
the

what 
we 
know 
we 
call 
the 
laws 
of
inevitability, 
what 
is 
unknown 
to 
us 
we 
call 
vital 
force. 
Vital 
force 
is
only 
an 
expression 
for 
the 
unknown 
remainder 
over 
and 
above 
what 
we 
know
of 
the

So<p>
also 
in 
history 
what 
is 
known 
to 
us 
we 
call 
laws 
of 
inevitability,
what 
is 
unknown 
we

Free

is 
for

only

Most 
of 
the 
people 
at
that

paid 
no

to 
the

they

Those

the 
general 
course 
of 
events 
and 
to 
take
part 
in 
it 
by 
self-sacrifice

were 
the 
most 
useless 
members
of 
society, 
they 
saw 
everything 
upside 
down, 
and 
all 
they 
did 
for 
the
common 
good 
turned 
out 
to 
be 
useless 
and 
foolish-like 
Pierre's 
and
Mamonov's<p>

looted 
Russian 
villages, 
and 
the

young 
ladies

and 
that 
never

the 
wounded, 
and 
so 
on.

those, 
fond 
of 
intellectual 
talk 
and 
of

their

who<p>

Russia's

a

condemnation

rule
forbidding

Tree

Only

he

If

wiped

perspiring 
face

pulled 
up 
the 
damp
collar 
which 
he 
had 
arranged 
so 
well 
at 
home 
to 
seem 
like 
a 
man's.

He 
felt 
that 
he 
no 
<a href="/cZl/ZCh359hMvng.html">longer</a><p>
looked 
presentable, 
and 
feared 
that 
if 
he

approach 
the 
gentlemen-in-waiting 
in 
that 
plight 
he 
would 
not 
be

was 
impossible

of

an

Petya

those

Karataev's 
affectionate 
tenderness 
for 
him 
(by 
which
he 
unconsciously 
gave 
Pierre's

life 
its

he 
would 
not 
have
grieved 
for 
a 
moment 
at 
parting 
from 
him. 
And 
Pierre 
began 
to 
feel 
in
the 
same 
way 
toward 
Karataev.

To 
all 
the 
other 
prisoners 
Platon 
Karataev 
seemed 
a 
most 
ordinary
soldier. 
They 
called<p>
him 
"little 
falcon" 
or 
"Platosha," 
chaffed 
him
good-naturedly, 
and 
sent 
him 
on 
errands. 
But 
to 
Pierre 
he 
always
remained 
what 
he 
had 
seemed 
that 
first 
night: 
an 
unfathomable,<p>
rounded,
eternal 
personification 
of 
the 
spirit 
of 
simplicity 
and 
truth.

Platon 
Karataev 
knew 
nothing 
by 
heart 
except 
his 
prayers. 
When 
he 
began
to 
speak 
he 
seemed 
not 
to 
know 
how 
he 
would 
conclude.

Sometimes 
Pierre, 
struck 
by 
the 
meaning 
of 
his 
words, 
would 
ask 
him 
to
repeat 
them, 
but 
Platon 
could 
never 
recall 
what 
he 
had 
said 
a 
moment
before, 
just 
as 
he 
never 
could 
repeat 
to 
Pierre 
the 
words 
of 
his
favorite 
song: 
native 
and 
birch 
tree 
and 
my 
heart 
is 
sick 
occurred 
in
it, 
but 
when 
spoken 
and 
not 
sung, 
no 
meaning 
could 
be 
got 
out 
of 
it. 
He
did 
not, 
and 
could 
not, 
understand 
the 
meaning 
of 
words 
apart 
from
their 
context. 
Every 
word 
and 
action 
of 
his 
was 
the 
manifestation 
of
an 
activity 
unknown 
to 
him, 
which 
was 
his 
life. 
But 
his 
life, 
as 
he
regarded<p>
it,<p>
had 
no 
meaning 
as 
a 
separate 
thing. 
It 
had 
meaning 
only 
as
part 
of 
a 
whole 
of 
which 
he 
was 
always 
conscious. 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm2HwD3a7Cv.html">His</a> 
words 
and 
actions
flowed 
from 
him

evenly,

CHAPTER 
XIV

When 
Princess 
Mary 
heard 
from 
<a href="/cZl/Cv8A9oSU7PBy.html">Nicholas</a> 
that 
her 
brother 
was 
with 
the
Rostovs 
at 
Yaroslavl 
she 
at 
once 
prepared 
to 
go 
there, 
in 
spite 
of 
her
aunt's 
efforts 
to 
dissuade 
her-and 
not 
merely 
to 
go 
herself 
but 
to 
take
her 
nephew 
with 
her. 
Whether 
it 
were 
difficult 
or 
easy, 
possible 
or
impossible, 
she 
did 
not 
ask 
and 
did 
not 
want 
to 
know: 
it 
was 
her 
duty,
not 
only 
to 
herself, 
to 
be 
near 
her 
brother 
who 
was 
perhaps 
dying, 
but
to 
do 
everything 
possible 
to 
take 
his 
son 
to 
him, 
and 
so 
she 
prepared
to 
set 
off. 
That 
she 
had 
not 
heard 
from 
Prince 
Andrew 
himself, 
Princess
Mary 
attributed 
to 
his 
being 
too 
weak 
to 
write 
or<p>
to 
his 
considering 
the
long 
journey 
too 
hard 
and 
too 
dangerous 
for 
her 
and 
his 
son.

In 
a 
few 
days 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
ready 
to 
start. 
Her 
equipages 
were 
the
huge 
family 
coach 
in 
which 
she 
had 
traveled 
to 
Voronezh, 
a 
semiopen
trap, 
and 
a 
baggage 
cart. 
With 
her 
traveled 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne,
little 
Nicholas 
and 
his 
tutor, 
her 
old 
nurse, 
three 
maids, 
Tikhon, 
and 
a
young 
footman 
and 
courier 
her 
aunt 
had<p>
sent 
to 
accompany 
her.

The 
usual 
route 
through 
Moscow 
could 
not 
be 
thought 
of, 
and 
<a href="/cZl/DU5e23A.html">the
roundabout</a> 
way 
Princess 
Mary 
was 
obliged 
to 
take 
through 
Lipetsk,
Ryazan, 
Vladimir, 
and 
Shuya 
was 
very 
long 
and, 
as 
post 
horses 
were 
not
everywhere 
obtainable, 
very 
difficult, 
and 
near 
Ryazan 
where 
the 
French
were 
said 
to 
have 
shown 
themselves 
was 
even 
dangerous.

During 
this 
difficult 
journey 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
Dessalles, 
and
Princess 
Mary's 
servants 
were 
astonished 
at 
her 
energy 
and 
firmness 
of
spirit. 
She 
went 
to 
bed 
later 
and 
rose 
earlier 
than 
any 
of 
them, 
and
no 
difficulties 
daunted 
her.

campfire, 
but 
to 
an
unharnessed 
cart 
where 
there 
was 
nobody. 
Tucking 
his 
legs 
under 
him 
and
dropping 
his 
head 
he 
sat 
down 
on 
the 
cold 
ground 
by 
the 
wheel 
of 
the
cart 
and 
remained 
motionless 
a 
long<p>
while 
sunk 
in 
thought. 
Suddenly 
he
burst 
out 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uf7tvrb2gK1hOZs.html">into</a> 
a 
fit 
of 
his 
broad, 
good-natured 
laughter, 
so 
loud 
that
men 
from 
various 
sides 
turned 
with 
surprise 
to 
see 
what 
this 
strange 
and
evidently 
solitary 
laughter 
could 
mean.

"Ha-ha-ha!" 
laughed 
Pierre. 
And 
he 
said 
aloud 
to 
himself: 
"The 
soldier
did 
not 
let 
me 
pass. 
They 
took 
me 
and 
shut 
me 
up. 
They 
hold 
me 
captive.
What,<p>
me? 
Me? 
My 
immortal 
soul? 
Ha-ha-ha! 
Ha-ha-ha!..." 
and 
he 
laughed
till 
tears 
started 
to 
his 
eyes.

A 
man 
got 
up 
and 
came 
to 
see 
what 
this 
queer 
big 
fellow 
was 
laughing 
at
all 
by 
himself. 
Pierre 
stopped 
laughing, 
got 
up, 
went 
farther 
away 
from
the 
inquisitive 
man, 
and 
looked 
around 
him.

The 
huge, 
endless 
bivouac 
that 
had 
previously 
resounded 
with 
the
crackling 
of 
campfires 
and 
the 
voices 
of 
many 
men 
had 
grown 
quiet, 
the
red 
campfires 
were 
growing 
paler 
and 
dying 
down. 
High 
up 
in 
the 
light
sky 
hung 
the 
full 
moon. 
Forests 
and 
fields 
beyond 
the 
camp, 
unseen
before, 
were 
now 
visible 
in 
the 
distance. 
And 
farther 
still, 
beyond
those 
forests<p>
and 
fields, 
the 
bright, 
oscillating, 
limitless 
distance
lured 
one 
to 
itself. 
Pierre 
glanced 
up 
at 
the 
sky 
and 
the 
twinkling
stars 
in 
its 
faraway 
depths. 
"And 
all 
that 
is 
me, 
all 
that 
is 
within 
me,
and 
it 
is 
all 
I!" 
thought 
Pierre. 
"And 
they 
caught 
all 
that 
and 
put 
it
into 
a<p>
shed 
boarded 
up 
with 
planks!" 
He 
smiled, 
and 
went 
and 
lay 
down 
to
sleep 
beside 
his 
companions.





CHAPTER 
XV

In 
the 
early 
days 
of 
October 
another 
envoy 
came 
to<p>
Kutuzov 
with 
a 
letter
from 
Napoleon 
proposing 
peace 
and 
falsely 
dated 
from 
Moscow, 
though
Napoleon 
was 
already 
not 
far 
from 
Kutuzov 
on 
the 
old 
Kaluga 
road.
Kutuzov 
replied 
to 
this 
letter 
as 
he 
had 
done 
to 
the 
one 
formerly
brought 
by 
Lauriston, 
saying 
that 
there 
could 
be 
no 
question 
of 
peace.

Soon 
after 
that 
a 
report 
was 
received 
from 
Dorokhov's 
guerrilla
detachment 
operating 
to 
the 
left 
of 
Tarutino 
that 
troops 
of 
Broussier's
division 
had 
been 
seen 
at 
Forminsk 
and 
that 
being 
separated 
from 
the
rest 
of 
the 
French 
army 
they 
might 
easily 
be 
destroyed. 
The 
soldiers 
and
officers 
again 
demanded 
action. 
Generals 
on 
the 
staff, 
excited 
by 
the
memory 
of 
the 
easy 
victory 
at 
Tarutino, 
urged 
Kutuzov 
to 
carry 
out
Dorokhov's 
suggestion. 
Kutuzov 
did 
not 
consider 
any 
offensive 
necessary.
The 
result 
was 
a 
compromise 
which

before 
Princess 
Mary 
and 
turning 
red, 
but 
not 
taking
his 
departure.

Natasha 
gave 
him 
her 
hand 
and 
went 
out. 
Princess 
Mary 
on 
the 
other 
hand
instead 
of 
going 
away 
sank 
into 
an 
armchair, 
and 
looked 
sternly 
and
intently 
at 
him 
with 
her 
deep, 
radiant 
eyes. 
The 
weariness 
she
had 
plainly 
shown 
before 
had 
now 
quite 
passed 
off. 
With 
a 
deep 
and
long-drawn 
sigh 
she 
seemed 
to 
be 
prepared 
for 
a 
lengthy 
talk.

When 
Natasha 
left 
the 
room 
Pierre's 
confusion 
and 
awkwardness
immediately 
vanished 
and 
were 
replaced 
by 
eager 
excitement. 
He 
quickly
moved 
an 
armchair 
toward 
Princess 
Mary.

"Yes, 
I 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you," 
said 
he, 
answering 
her 
look 
as 
if 
she 
had
spoken. 
"Princess, 
help 
me! 
What 
am 
I 
to 
do? 
Can 
I 
hope? 
Princess, 
my
dear 
friend, 
listen! 
I 
know

all. 
I 
know 
I<p>
am 
not 
worthy 
of 
her, 
I
know 
it's 
impossible 
to 
speak 
of 
it 
now. 
But 
I 
want 
to 
be 
a 
brother 
to
her. 
No, 
not 
that, 
I 
don't, 
I 
can't..."

He 
paused 
and 
rubbed 
his 
face 
and 
eyes 
with 
his 
hands.

"Well," 
he 
went 
on 
with 
an 
evident 
effort 
at 
self-control 
and 
coherence.
"I 
don't 
know 
when 
I 
began 
to 
love 
her, 
but 
I 
have 
loved 
her 
and 
her
alone 
all 
my 
life, 
and 
I 
love 
her 
so 
that 
I 
cannot 
imagine 
life 
without
her. 
I 
cannot 
propose 
to 
her 
at 
present, 
but 
the 
thought 
that
perhaps 
she 
might 
someday 
be 
my 
wife 
and 
that 
I 
may 
be 
missing 
that
possibility... 
that 
possibility... 
is 
terrible. 
Tell 
me, 
can 
I 
hope?
Tell 
me 
what 
I 
am 
to

princess!" 
he 
added 
after 
a 
pause, 
and
touched 
her 
hand 
as 
she 
did 
not 
reply.

"I 
am 
thinking 
of 
what 
you 
have 
told 
me," 
answered 
Princess 
Mary.
"This 
is 
what 
I 
will 
say. 
You 
are 
right 
that 
to 
speak 
to 
her 
of<p>

Princess 
Mary 
stopped. 
She 
was 
going 
to 
say 
that 
to 
speak 
of 
love 
was
impossible, 
but 
she 
stopped 
because 
she 
had 
seen 
by 
the 
sudden 
change
in 
Natasha 
two 
days 
before 
that 
she 
would<p>
not 
only 
not 
be 
hurt 
if 
Pierre
spoke 
of 
his 
love, 
but 
that 
it 
was 
the 
very 
thing 
she 
wished 
for.

"To 
speak 
to 
her 
now 
wouldn't 
do," 
said 
the 
princess 
all 
the 
same.

"But 
what 
am 
I 
to 
do?"

"Leave 
it 
to 
me," 
said 
Princess 
Mary. 
"I 
know..."

Pierre 
was 
looking 
into 
Princess 
Mary's 
eyes.

"Well?... 
Well?..." 
he 
said.

"I 
know 
that 
she 
loves... 
will 
love 
you," 
Princess 
Mary 
corrected
herself.

Before 
her 
words 
were 
out, 
Pierre 
had 
sprung 
up 
and 
with 
a 
frightened
expression 
seized 
Princess

CHAPTER 
V

That 
same 
evening 
there 
was 
an 
animated 
discussion 
among 
the
squadron's 
officers 
in 
Denisov's 
quarters.

"And 
I 
tell 
you, 
Rostov, 
that 
you 
must 
apologize 
to 
the 
colonel!"
said 
a 
tall, 
grizzly-haired 
staff 
captain, 
with 
enormous 
mustaches 
and
many 
wrinkles 
on 
his 
large 
features, 
to 
Rostov 
who 
was 
crimson 
with
excitement.

The 
staff 
captain, 
Kirsten, 
had 
twice 
been 
reduced 
to 
the 
ranks 
for
affairs 
of 
honor 
and 
had 
twice 
regained 
his 
commission.

"I 
will 
allow 
no 
one 
to 
call 
me 
a 
liar!" 
cried 
Rostov. 
"He 
told
me 
I 
lied, 
and 
I 
told 
him 
he 
lied. 
And 
there 
it 
rests. 
He 
may 
keep 
me
on 
duty 
every 
day, 
or 
may 
place 
me 
under 
arrest, 
but 
no 
one 
can 
make
me 
apologize, 
because 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bF8Ro21viB.html">if</a> 
he, 
as 
commander 
of 
this 
regiment, 
thinks 
it
beneath 
his 
dignity 
to 
give 
me 
satisfaction, 
then..."

"You 
just 
wait 
a 
moment, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
and 
listen," 
interrupted
the 
staff 
captain 
in 
his 
deep 
bass, 
calmly 
stroking 
his 
long 
mustache.
"You 
tell 
the 
colonel 
in 
the 
presence 
of 
other 
officers 
that 
an
officer 
has 
stolen..."

"I'm 
not 
to 
blame 
that 
the 
conversation 
began 
in 
the 
presence 
of
other 
officers. 
Perhaps 
I 
ought 
not 
to 
have 
spoken 
before 
them, 
but 
I 
am
not 
a 
diplomatist. 
That's 
why 
I 
joined 
the 
hussars, 
thinking 
that 
here
one 
would 
not 
need 
finesse; 
and 
he 
tells 
me 
<a href="/cZl/YX7EI2NX7.html">that</a> 
I 
am 
lying-so 
let 
him
give 
me 
satisfaction..."

"That's 
all 
right. 
No 
one 
thinks 
you 
a<p>
coward, 
but 
that's 
not 
the
point. 
Ask 
Denisov 
whether 
it 
is 
not 
out 
of 
the 
question 
for 
a 
cadet 
to
demand 
satisfaction 
of 
his 
regimental 
commander?"

Denisov 
sat 
gloomily 
biting 
his 
mustache 
<a href="/cZl/SNe5NX8bZDWZ7UhXdK.html">and</a> 
listening 
to 
the
conversation,<p>
evidently 
with 
no 
wish 
to 
take 
part 
in 
it. 
He 
answered 
the
staff 
captain's 
question 
by 
a 
disapproving 
shake 
of 
his 
head.

"You 
speak 
to 
the 
colonel 
about 
this 
nasty 
business 
before 
other
officers," 
continued 
the 
staff 
captain, 
"and 
Bogdanich" 
(the
colonel 
was 
called 
Bogdanich) 
"shuts 
you 
up."

"He 
did 
not 
shut 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI2Ix7tvJE5Y.html">me</a> 
up, 
he 
said 
I 
was 
telling 
an 
untruth."

"Well, 
have 
it 
so, 
and 
you 
talked 
a 
lot 
of 
nonsense 
to 
him 
and 
must
apologize."

"Not 
on 
any 
account!" 
exclaimed 
Rostov.

"I 
did 
not 
expect 
this 
of 
you," 
said 
the 
staff 
captain 
seriously 
and
severely. 
"You 
don't<p>
wish 
to 
apologize, 
but, 
man, 
it's 
not 
only 
to
him 
but 
to 
the 
whole 
regiment-all 
of 
us-you're 
to 
blame 
all 
round.
The 
case 
is 
this: 
you 
ought 
to 
have 
thought 
the 
matter<p>
over 
and
taken 
advice; 
but 
no, 
you 
go 
and 
blurt 
it 
all 
straight 
out 
before 
the
officers. 
Now 
what 
was 
the 
colonel 
to 
do? 
Have 
the 
officer 
tried 
and
disgrace 
the 
whole 
regiment? 
Disgrace 
the 
whole 
regiment 
because 
of 
one
scoundrel? 
Is 
that 
how 
you 
look 
at 
it? 
We 
don't 
see 
it 
like 
that. 
And
Bogdanich 
was 
a 
brick: 
he 
told 
you 
you 
were 
saying 
what 
was 
not 
true.
It's 
not 
pleasant, 
but 
what's 
to 
be 
done, 
my 
dear 
fellow? 
You 
landed
yourself 
in 
it.

worlds

made
haste 
to 
satisfy 
all 
their 
expectations.

Though 
the 
most 
absent-minded 
and 
forgetful 
of 
men, 
Pierre, 
with 
the 
aid
of 
a 
list 
his

drew 
up, 
had 
now 
bought

In

him

for 
his 
sovereign
rose 
again 
in 
Rostov's<p>
soul 
in 
all 
its 
old 
force. 
In 
the 
uniform 
of
the 
Preobrazhensk 
regiment-white 
chamois-leather 
breeches 
and 
high
boots-and 
wearing 
a 
star 
Rostov 
did 
not 
know 
(it 
was 
that 
of 
the
Legion 
d'honneur), 
the 
monarch 
came 
out 
into 
the 
porch, 
putting 
on
his 
gloves 
and 
carrying 
his 
hat 
under 
his 
arm. 
He 
stopped 
and 
looked
about 
him, 
brightening 
everything 
around 
by 
his 
glance. 
He 
spoke 
a 
few
words 
to 
some 
of 
the 
generals, 
and, 
recognizing 
the 
former 
commander 
of
Rostov's 
division, 
smiled 
and 
beckoned 
to 
him.

All 
the 
suite 
drew 
back 
and 
Rostov 
saw 
the 
general 
talking 
for 
some
time 
to 
the 
Emperor.

The 
Emperor 
said 
a 
few 
words 
to 
him 
and 
took 
a 
step 
toward 
his 
horse.
Again 
the 
crowd 
of 
members 
of 
the 
suite 
and 
street 
gazers 
(among 
whom
was 
Rostov) 
moved 
nearer 
to 
the 
Emperor. 
<a href="/aVzUge/PC6XKBx6fnq.html">Stopping</a> 
beside 
his 
horse,
with 
his 
hand 
on 
the 
saddle, 
the 
Emperor 
turned 
to 
the 
cavalry 
general
and 
said 
in 
a 
loud 
voice, 
evidently 
wishing 
to 
be 
heard 
by 
all:

"I 
cannot 
do 
it, 
General. 
I 
cannot, 
because 
the 
law 
is 
stronger 
than
I," 
and 
he 
raised 
his 
foot 
to 
the 
stirrup.

The 
general 
bowed 
his 
head 
respectfully,<p>
and 
the 
monarch 
mounted 
and
rode 
down 
the 
street 
at 
a 
gallop. 
Beside 
himself 
with 
enthusiasm,
Rostov 
ran 
after 
him 
with 
the 
crowd.





CHAPTER 
XXI

The 
Emperor 
rode 
to 
the 
square 
where, 
facing 
one 
another, 
a 
battalion
of 
the 
Preobrazhensk 
regiment 
stood 
on 
the 
right 
and 
a 
battalion 
of 
the
French 
Guards 
in 
their 
bearskin 
caps 
on 
the 
left.

As 
the 
Tsar 
rode 
up 
to 
one 
flank 
of 
the 
battalions, 
which 
presented
arms, 
another 
group 
of 
horsemen 
galloped 
up 
to 
the 
opposite 
flank, 
and
at 
the 
head 
of 
them 
Rostov 
recognized 
Napoleon. 
It 
could 
be 
no 
one
else. 
He 
came 
at 
a 
gallop, 
wearing 
a 
small 
hat, 
a 
blue 
uniform 
open 
over
a 
white 
vest, 
and 
the 
St. 
Andrew 
ribbon 
over 
his 
shoulder. 
He 
was 
riding
a 
very 
fine 
thoroughbred 
gray 
Arab 
horse 
with 
a 
crimson 
gold-embroidered
saddlecloth. 
On 
approaching 
Alexander 
he 
raised 
his 
hat, 
and 
as 
he 
did
so, 
Rostov, 
with 
his 
cavalryman's 
eye, 
could 
not 
help 
noticing
that 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
sit 
well 
or 
firmly 
in 
the 
saddle. 
The 
battalions
shouted 
"Hurrah!" 
and 
"Vive 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bF8Ro21viB.html">l'Empereur!"</a> 
Napoleon 
said
something 
to 
Alexander, 
and 
both 
Emperors 
dismounted 
and 
took 
each
other's 
hands. 
Napoleon's 
face 
wore 
an 
unpleasant 
and 
artificial
smile. 
Alexander 
was 
saying 
something 
affable

handsome

and,

is 
always 
the

in 
an

a

taller

looked

in 
an
embarrassing 
situation, 
and 
the 
expression 
on 
his 
face 
was 
invariably
reflected 
on 
theirs.

Owing 
to 
the 
terrible 
uproar 
and 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/Bx6b5BYyw6v.html">necessity</a> 
for 
concentration 
and
activity, 
Tushin 
did 
not 
experience 
the 
slightest 
unpleasant 
sense 
of
fear, 
and 
the 
thought 
that 
he 
might 
be 
killed 
or 
badly 
wounded 
never
occurred 
to 
him. 
On 
the 
contrary, 
he 
became 
more 
and 
more 
elated. 
It
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
it 
was 
a<p>
very 
long 
time 
ago, 
almost 
a 
day, 
since 
he
had 
first 
seen 
the 
enemy 
and 
fired 
the 
first 
shot, 
and 
that 
the 
corner
of 
the 
field 
he 
stood 
on 
was 
well-known 
and 
familiar 
ground. 
Though 
he
thought 
of 
everything, 
considered 
everything, 
and 
did 
everything 
the
best 
of 
officers 
could 
do 
in 
his 
position, 
he 
was 
in 
a<p>
state 
akin 
to
feverish 
delirium 
or 
drunkenness.

From 
the 
deafening 
sounds 
of 
his 
own 
guns 
around 
him, 
the 
whistle 
and
thud 
of 
the 
enemy's 
cannon 
balls, 
from 
the 
flushed 
and 
perspiring
faces 
of 
the 
crew 
bustling 
round 
the 
guns, 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
the 
blood
of 
men 
and 
horses, 
from 
the 
little 
puffs 
of 
smoke 
on 
the 
enemy's 
side
(always 
followed 
by 
a 
ball 
flying 
past 
and 
striking 
the 
earth, 
a 
man, 
a
gun, 
a 
horse), 
from 
the 
sight 
of 
all 
these 
things 
a 
fantastic 
world 
of
his 
own 
had 
taken 
possession 
of 
his 
brain 
and 
at 
that 
moment 
afforded
him 
pleasure. 
The 
enemy's 
guns 
were 
in 
his 
fancy 
not 
guns 
but 
pipes
from 
which 
occasional 
puffs 
were 
blown 
by 
an 
invisible 
smoker.

"There... 
he's 
puffing 
again," 
muttered 
Tushin 
to 
himself, 
as 
a
small 
cloud 
rose 
from 
the 
hill 
and 
was 
borne 
in 
a 
streak 
to 
the 
left 
by
the 
wind.

"Now 
look 
out 
for 
the 
ball... 
we'll 
throw 
it 
back."

"What 
do 
you 
want, 
your 
honor?" 
asked 
an 
artilleryman, 
standing
close 
by, 
who 
heard 
him 
muttering.

"Nothing... 
only 
a 
shell..." 
he 
answered.

"Come 
along, 
our 
Matvevna!" 
he 
said 
to 
himself. 
"Matvevna" 
*
was 
the 
name 
his 
fancy 
gave 
to 
the 
farthest 
gun 
of 
the<p>
battery, 
which
was 
large 
and 
of 
an 
old 
pattern. 
The 
French 
swarming 
round 
their 
guns
seemed 
to 
him 
like 
ants. 
In 
that 
world, 
the 
handsome 
drunkard 
Number 
One
of 
the 
second 
gun's 
crew 
was 
"uncle"; 
Tushin 
looked 
at 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Qb7OfLLj2oFuln5tEu.html">him</a> 
more
often 
than 
at 
anyone 
else 
and 
took 
delight 
in 
his 
every 
movement.
The 
sound 
of 
musketry 
at 
the 
foot 
of 
the 
hill, 
now 
diminishing, 
now
increasing, 
seemed 
like 
someone's 
breathing. 
He 
listened 
intently 
to
the 
ebb 
and 
flow 
of 
these 
sounds.

 
 
 
 
* 
Daughter 
of 
Matthew.

"Ah! 
Breathing 
again, 
breathing!" 
he 
muttered 
to 
himself.

He 
imagined 
himself 
as 
an 
enormously 
tall, 
powerful 
man 
who 
was 
throwing
cannon 
balls 
at 
the 
French 
with 
both 
hands.

"Now 
then, 
Matvevna, 
dear 
old<p>
lady, 
don't 
let 
me 
down!" 
he 
was
saying 
as 
he 
moved 
from 
the 
gun, 
when 
a 
strange, 
unfamiliar 
voice 
called
above 
his 
head: 
"Captain 
Tushin! 
Captain!"

Tushin 
turned 
round 
in 
dismay. 
It 
was 
the 
staff 
officer 
who 
had<p>
turned
him 
out 
of 
the 
booth 
at 
Grunth. 
He 
was 
shouting 
in 
a 
gasping 
voice:

"Are 
you 
mad? 
You 
have 
twice 
been 
ordered 
to 
retreat, 
and 
you..."

"Why 
are 
they 
down 
on 
me?" 
thought 
Tushin, 
looking 
in 
alarm 
at 
his
superior.

"I... 
don't..." 
he 
muttered, 
holding 
up 
two 
fingers 
to 
his 
cap.
"I..."

But 
the 
staff 
officer 
did 
not 
finish 
what 
he 
wanted 
to 
say. 
A 
cannon
ball, 
flying 
close 
to 
him, 
caused 
him 
to 
duck 
and 
bend 
over 
his 
horse.
He 
paused, 
and 
just 
as 
he 
was 
about 
to 
say 
something 
more, 
another 
ball
stopped 
him. 
He 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
off.

"Retire! 
All 
to 
retire!" 
he 
shouted 
from 
a 
distance.

The 
soldiers 
laughed. 
A 
moment 
later, 
an 
adjutant 
arrived 
with 
the 
same
order.

It 
was 
Prince 
Andrew. 
The 
first 
thing 
he 
saw 
on 
riding 
up 
to 
the 
space
where 
Tushin's 
guns 
were 
stationed

fully.

The 
Tsar 
stopped 
a 
few 
minutes 
in 
front 
of 
the 
hussars 
as 
if 
undecided.

"How 
can 
the 
Emperor 
be 
undecided?" 
thought 
Rostov, 
but 
then 
even
this 
indecision 
appeared 
to 
him 
majestic 
and 
enchanting, 
like 
everything
else 
the 
Tsar 
did.

That 
hesitation 
lasted 
only 
an 
instant. 
The 
Tsar's 
foot, 
in 
the 
narrow
pointed 
boot 
then 
fashionable, 
touched 
the 
groin 
of 
the 
bobtailed 
bay
mare 
he 
rode, 
his 
hand 
in 
a 
white 
glove 
gathered 
up 
the 
reins, 
and 
he
moved 
off 
accompanied 
by 
an 
irregularly 
swaying 
sea 
of 
aides-de-camp.
Farther 
and 
farther 
he 
rode 
away, 
stopping 
at 
other 
regiments, 
till 
at
last 
only 
his 
white 
plumes 
were 
visible 
to 
Rostov 
from 
amid 
the 
suites
that 
surrounded 
the 
Emperors.

Among 
the 
gentlemen 
of 
the 
suite, 
Rostov 
noticed 
Bolkonski, 
sitting
his 
horse 
indolently 
and 
carelessly. 
Rostov 
recalled 
their 
quarrel 
of
yesterday 
and 
the 
question 
presented 
itself 
whether 
he 
ought 
or 
ought
not 
to 
challenge 
Bolkonski. 
"Of 
course 
not!" 
he 
now 
thought. 
"Is
it 
worth 
thinking 
or 
speaking 
of 
it 
at 
such 
a 
moment? 
At 
a 
time 
of 
such
love, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xA8viB9t0HAb.html">such</a> 
rapture, 
and 
such 
self-sacrifice, 
what 
do 
any 
of 
our 
quarrels
and 
affronts 
matter? 
I 
love 
and 
forgive 
everybody 
now."

When 
the 
Emperor 
had 
passed 
nearly 
all 
the 
regiments, 
the 
troops 
began
a 
ceremonial 
march 
past 
him, 
and 
Rostov 
on 
Bedouin, 
recently 
purchased
from 
Denisov, 
rode 
past 
too, 
at 
the 
rear 
of 
his 
squadron-that 
is,
alone 
and 
in 
full 
view 
of 
the 
Emperor.

Before 
he 
reached 
him, 
Rostov, 
who 
was 
a 
splendid 
horseman, 
spurred
Bedouin 
twice 
and 
successfully 
put 
him 
to 
the 
showy 
trot 
in 
which 
the
animal 
went 
when 
excited. 
Bending 
his 
foaming 
muzzle 
to 
his 
chest, 
his
tail 
extended, 
Bedouin, 
as 
if 
also 
conscious 
of 
the 
<a href="/cZl/qi6zvJ6ej1tsa.html">Emperor's</a> 
eye
upon 
him, 
passed 
splendidly, 
lifting 
his 
feet 
with 
a 
high 
and 
graceful
action, 
as 
if 
flying 
through 
the 
air 
without 
touching 
the 
ground.

Rostov 
himself, 
his 
legs 
well 
back 
and 
his 
stomach 
drawn 
in 
and 
feeling
himself 
one 
with 
his 
horse, 
rode 
past 
the 
Emperor 
with 
<a href="/cZl/PK5ZUI0EXJo9ON.html">a</a> 
frowning 
but
blissful 
face 
"like 
a 
vewy 
devil," 
as 
Denisov 
expressed 
it.

"Fine 
fellows, 
the 
Pavlograds!" 
remarked 
the 
Emperor.

"My 
God, 
how 
happy 
I 
should 
be 
if 
he 
ordered 
me 
to 
leap<p>
into 
the 
fire
this 
instant!" 
thought 
Rostov.

When 
the 
review 
was 
over, 
the 
newly 
arrived 
officers, 
and 
also
Kutuzov's, 
collected 
in 
groups 
and 
began 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
awards,
about 
the 
Austrians 
and 
their 
uniforms, 
about 
their 
lines, 
about
Bonaparte, 
and 
how 
badly 
the 
latter 
would 
fare 
now, 
especially 
if 
the
Essen 
corps 
arrived 
and 
Prussia 
took 
our 
side.

But 
the 
talk 
in 
every 
group 
was 
chiefly 
about 
the 
Emperor 
Alexander. 
His
every 
word 
and 
movement 
was 
described 
with 
ecstasy.

They 
all 
had 
but 
one 
wish: 
to 
advance 
as 
soon 
as 
possible 
against 
the
enemy 
under 
the 
Emperor's 
command.

moment. 
The 
sick 
man 
was 
given 
something 
to 
drink, 
there 
was 
a
stir 
around 
him, 
then 
the 
people 
resumed 
their 
places 
and 
the 
service
continued. 
During 
this 
interval 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
Prince 
Vasili
left 
the 
chair 
on 
which 
he 
had 
been 
leaning, 
and-with 
an 
air
which 
intimated 
that 
he 
knew 
what 
he 
was 
about 
and 
if 
others 
did 
not
understand 
him 
it 
was 
so 
much 
the 
worse 
for 
them-did 
not 
go 
up 
to 
the
dying 
man, 
but 
passed 
by 
him, 
joined 
the 
eldest 
princess, 
and 
moved
with 
her 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
room 
where 
stood 
the 
high 
bedstead 
with 
its
silken 
hangings. 
On 
leaving 
the 
bed 
both 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
the 
princess
passed 
out 
by 
a 
back 
door, 
but 
returned 
to 
their 
places 
one 
after 
the
other 
before 
the 
service 
was 
concluded. 
Pierre 
paid 
no 
more 
attention
to 
this 
occurrence 
than 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
what 
went 
on, 
having 
made 
up 
his
mind 
once 
for 
all 
that 
what 
he 
saw 
happening 
around 
him 
that 
evening 
was
in 
some 
way 
essential.

The 
chanting 
of 
the 
service 
ceased, 
and 
the 
voice 
of 
the 
priest 
was
heard 
respectfully 
congratulating 
the 
dying 
man 
on 
having 
received 
the
sacrament. 
The 
dying 
man 
lay 
as 
lifeless 
and 
immovable 
as 
before. 
Around
him 
everyone 
began 
to 
stir: 
steps 
were 
audible 
and 
whispers, 
among 
which
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
was 
the 
most 
distinct.

Pierre<p>
heard 
her 
say:

"Certainly 
he 
must 
be 
moved 
onto 
the 
bed; 
here 
it 
will 
be
impossible..."

The 
sick 
man 
was 
so 
surrounded 
by 
doctors, 
princesses, 
and 
servants
that 
Pierre 
could 
no 
longer 
see 
the 
reddish-yellow 
face 
with 
its 
gray
mane-which, 
though 
he 
saw 
other 
faces 
as 
well, 
he 
had 
not 
lost 
sight
of 
for 
a 
single 
moment 
during 
the 
whole 
service. 
He 
judged 
by 
the
cautious 
movements 
of 
those 
who 
crowded 
round 
the 
invalid<p>
chair 
that
they 
had 
lifted 
the 
dying 
man 
and 
were 
moving 
him.

"Catch 
hold 
of 
my 
arm 
or 
you'll 
drop 
him!" 
he 
heard 
one 
of 
the
servants 
say 
in 
a 
frightened 
whisper. 
"Catch 
hold 
from 
underneath.
Here!" 
exclaimed 
different 
voices; 
and 
the 
heavy 
breathing 
of 
the
bearers 
and 
the 
shuffling 
of 
their 
feet 
grew 
more 
hurried, 
as 
if 
the
weight 
they 
were 
carrying 
were 
too 
much 
for 
them.

As 
the 
bearers, 
among 
whom 
was 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna, 
passed 
the 
young 
man
he 
caught 
a 
momentary 
glimpse 
between 
their 
heads 
and 
backs 
of 
the 
dying
man's 
high, 
stout, 
uncovered 
chest 
and 
powerful 
shoulders, 
raised 
by
those 
who 
were 
holding 
him 
under 
the 
armpits, 
and 
of 
his 
gray, 
curly,
leonine 
head. 
This 
head, 
with 
its 
remarkably 
broad 
brow 
and 
cheekbones,
its 
handsome, 
sensual 
mouth, 
and 
its 
cold, 
majestic 
expression, 
was
not 
disfigured 
by<p>
the 
approach 
of 
death. 
It 
was 
the 
same 
as 
Pierre
remembered 
it 
three 
months 
before, 
when 
the 
count 
had 
sent 
him 
to
Petersburg. 
But 
now 
this 
head 
was 
swaying 
helplessly 
with 
the 
uneven
movements 
of 
the 
bearers, 
and 
the 
cold 
listless 
gaze 
fixed 
itself 
upon
nothing.

After 
a 
few 
minutes' 
bustle 
beside 
the 
high 
bedstead, 
those 
who 
had
carried 
the 
sick 
man 
dispersed. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
touched 
Pierre's
hand 
and 
said, 
"Come." 
Pierre 
went 
with 
her 
to 
the 
bed 
on 
which 
the
sick 
man 
had 
been 
laid 
in 
a 
stately 
pose 
in 
keeping 
with 
the 
ceremony
just 
completed. 
He 
lay 
with 
his 
head 
propped 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eo4YfX8yG2mrwmb.html">high</a> 
on 
the 
pillows. 
His
hands 
were 
symmetrically 
placed 
on 
the 
green 
silk 
quilt, 
the 
palms
downward. 
When 
Pierre 
came 
up 
the 
count 
was 
gazing 
straight 
at 
him, 
but
with 
a 
look 
the 
significance 
of 
which 
could 
not 
be 
understood 
by 
mortal
man. 
Either 
this 
look 
meant 
nothing 
but 
that

long 
as

fight 
a

with<p>
rapiers
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
the 
art 
of 
fencing. 
The 
fencing 
has
gone 
on 
for 
some 
time; 
suddenly 
one 
of 
the 
combatants, 
feeling 
himself
wounded 
and<p>
understanding 
that 
the 
matter 
is 
no 
joke 
but 
concerns<p>
his
life, 
throws 
down 
his 
rapier, 
and 
seizing 
the 
first 
cudgel 
that 
comes 
to
hand 
begins 
to 
brandish 
it. 
Then 
let 
us 
imagine 
that 
the 
combatant 
who
so 
sensibly 
employed 
the 
best 
and 
simplest 
means 
to 
attain 
his 
end 
was
at 
the 
same 
time 
influenced 
by 
traditions 
of 
chivalry 
and, 
desiring 
to
conceal 
the 
facts 
of 
the 
case, 
insisted 
that 
he 
had 
gained 
his 
victory
with 
the 
rapier 
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
art. 
One 
can 
imagine 
what
confusion 
and 
obscurity 
would 
result 
from 
such 
an 
account 
of 
the 
duel.

The 
fencer<p>
who 
demanded 
a 
contest 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
fencing 
was
the 
French 
army; 
his 
opponent 
who 
threw 
away 
the 
rapier 
and 
snatched 
up
the 
cudgel 
was 
the 
Russian 
people; 
those 
who 
try 
to 
explain 
the 
matter
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
fencing 
are 
the 
historians 
who 
have 
described
the 
event.

After 
the 
burning 
of 
Smolensk 
a 
war 
began 
which 
did 
not 
follow 
any
previous 
traditions 
of 
war. 
The 
burning 
of 
towns 
and 
villages, 
the
retreats 
after 
battles, 
the 
blow 
dealt<p>
at 
Borodino 
and 
the 
renewed
retreat, 
the 
burning 
of 
Moscow, 
the 
capture 
of 
marauders, 
the 
seizure 
of
transports, 
and 
the 
guerrilla 
war 
were 
all 
departures 
from 
the 
rules.

Napoleon 
felt 
this, 
and 
from 
the 
time 
he 
took 
up 
the 
correct 
fencing
attitude 
in 
Moscow 
and 
instead 
of 
his 
opponent's 
rapier 
saw 
a 
cudgel
raised 
above 
his 
head, 
he 
did 
not 
cease 
to 
complain 
to 
Kutuzov 
and 
to
the 
Emperor 
Alexander 
that 
the 
war 
was 
being 
carried 
on 
contrary 
to 
all
the 
rules-as 
if 
there 
were 
any 
rules 
for 
killing 
people. 
In 
spite 
of 
the
complaints 
of 
the 
French 
as 
to 
the 
nonobservance 
of 
the 
rules, 
in
spite 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
to 
some 
highly 
placed 
Russians 
it 
seemed 
rather
disgraceful 
to 
fight 
with 
a 
cudgel 
and 
they 
wanted 
to 
assume 
a 
pose 
en
quarte 
or 
en 
tierce 
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules, 
and 
to 
make 
an 
adroit
thrust 
en 
prime, 
and 
so 
on-the 
cudgel 
of 
the 
people's 
war 
was 
lifted
with 
all 
its 
menacing 
and 
majestic 
strength, 
and 
without<p>
consulting
anyone's 
tastes 
or 
rules 
and 
regardless 
of 
anything 
else, 
it 
rose 
and
fell 
with 
stupid 
simplicity, 
but 
consistently, 
and 
belabored 
the 
French
till 
the 
whole 
invasion 
had 
perished.

And 
it 
is 
well 
for 
a 
people 
who 
do 
not-as 
the 
French 
did 
in 
1813-salute
according 
to 
all 
the 
rules 
of 
art, 
and, 
presenting 
the 
hilt 
of 
their
rapier 
gracefully 
and 
politely, 
hand 
it 
to 
their 
magnanimous 
conqueror,
but 
at 
the 
moment 
of 
trial, 
without 
asking 
what 
rules 
others 
have
adopted 
in 
similar 
cases, 
simply 
and 
easily 
pick 
up 
the 
first 
cudgel
that 
comes 
to 
hand 
and 
strike 
with 
it 
till 
the 
feeling 
of 
resentment 
and
revenge 
in 
their 
soul 
yields 
to 
a 
feeling 
of 
contempt 
and 
compassion.





CHAPTER 
II

One 
of 
the 
most 
obvious 
and 
advantageous 
departures 
from 
the 
so-called
laws 
of 
war 
is 
the 
action 
of 
scattered 
groups 
against 
men 
pressed
together 
in 
a 
mass. 
Such 
action 
always 
occurs 
in 
wars 
that 
take 
on 
a
national 
character. 
In 
such 
actions, 
instead 
of 
two 
crowds 
opposing
each 
other, 
the 
men 
disperse, 
attack 
singly, 
run 
away 
when 
attacked 
by
stronger 
forces, 
but 
again 
attack 
when 
opportunity 
offers. 
This 
was 
done
by 
the 
guerrillas 
in 
Spain, 
by 
the<p>
mountain 
tribes 
in 
the 
Caucasus, 
and
by 
the 
Russians 
in 
1812.

People 
have 
called 
this 
kind 
of 
war 
"guerrilla 
warfare"

that 
of 
a</h1>nobleman 
of 
medium 
height 
and 
about 
forty 
years
of 
age, 
whom 
Pierre 
had 
formerly 
met 
at 
the 
gypsies' 
and 
knew 
as 
a 
bad
cardplayer, 
and 
who, 
also 
transformed 
by 
his 
uniform, 
came 
up 
to 
Pierre,
interrupted 
Adraksin.

"Yes, 
and 
this 
is 
not 
a 
time 
for 
discussing," 
he 
continued, 
"but 
for
acting: 
there 
is 
war 
in 
Russia! 
The 
enemy 
is 
advancing 
to 
destroy
Russia, 
to 
desecrate 
the 
tombs 
of 
our 
fathers, 
to 
carry 
off 
our 
wives
and 
children." 
The 
nobleman 
smote 
his 
breast. 
"We 
will 
all 
arise,
everyone 
of 
us 
will 
go, 
for 
our 
father 
the 
Tsar!" 
he 
shouted, 
rolling
his 
bloodshot 
eyes. 
Several 
approving 
voices 
were 
heard 
in 
the 
crowd.
"We 
are 
Russians 
and 
will 
not 
grudge 
our 
blood 
in 
defense 
of 
our 
faith,
the 
throne, 
and 
the 
Fatherland! 
We 
must 
cease 
raving 
if 
we 
are 
sons 
of
our 
Fatherland! 
We 
will 
show 
Europe 
how 
Russia 
rises 
to 
the 
defense 
of
Russia!"

Pierre 
wished 
to 
reply, 
but 
could 
not 
get 
in 
a 
word. 
He 
felt 
that 
his
words, 
apart 
from 
what 
meaning 
they 
conveyed, 
were 
less 
audible 
than 
the
sound 
of 
his 
opponent's 
voice.

Count 
Rostov 
at 
the 
back 
of 
the 
crowd 
was 
expressing 
approval; 
several
persons, 
briskly 
turning 
a 
shoulder 
to 
the 
orator 
at 
the 
end 
of 
a
phrase, 
said:

"That's 
right, 
quite 
right! 
Just<p>
so!"

Pierre 
wished 
to 
say 
that 
he 
was 
ready 
to 
sacrifice 
his 
money, 
his
serfs, 
or 
himself, 
only 
one 
ought 
to 
know 
the 
state 
of 
affairs 
in
order 
to 
be 
able 
to 
improve 
it, 
but 
he 
was 
unable 
to 
speak. 
Many 
voices
shouted 
and 
talked 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
so 
that 
Count 
Rostov 
had 
not 
time
to 
signify 
his 
approval 
of 
them 
all, 
and 
the 
group 
increased, 
dispersed,
re-formed, 
and 
then 
moved 
with 
a 
hum 
of 
talk 
into 
the 
largest 
hall 
and
to 
the 
big 
table. 
Not 
only 
was 
Pierre's 
attempt 
to 
speak 
unsuccessful,
but 
he 
was 
rudely 
interrupted, 
pushed 
aside, 
and 
people 
turned 
away
from 
him 
as 
from 
a 
common 
enemy. 
This 
happened 
not 
because 
they 
were
displeased 
by 
the 
substance 
of 
his 
speech, 
which 
had 
even 
been 
forgotten
after 
the 
many 
subsequent 
speeches, 
but 
to 
animate 
it 
the 
crowd 
needed 
a
tangible 
object 
to 
love 
and 
a 
tangible 
object 
to 
hate. 
Pierre 
became 
the
latter. 
Many 
other 
orators 
spoke 
after 
the 
excited 
nobleman, 
and 
all 
in
the 
same 
tone. 
Many 
spoke 
eloquently 
and 
with 
originality.

Glinka, 
the 
editor 
of 
the 
Russian 
Messenger, 
who 
was 
recognized 
(cries
of 
"author! 
author!" 
were 
heard 
in 
the 
crowd), 
said 
that 
"hell 
must 
be
repulsed 
by 
hell," 
and 
that 
he 
had 
seen 
a 
child 
smiling 
at 
lightning
flashes 
and 
thunderclaps, 
but 
"we 
will 
not 
be 
that 
child."

"Yes, 
yes, 
at 
thunderclaps!" 
was 
repeated 
approvingly 
in 
the 
back 
rows
of 
the 
crowd.

The 
crowd 
drew 
up 
to<p>
the 
large 
table, 
at 
which 
sat 
gray-haired 
or 
bald
seventy-year-old 
magnates, 
uniformed 
and 
besashed, 
almost 
all 
of 
whom
Pierre 
had 
seen 
in 
their 
own 
homes 
with 
their 
buffoons, 
or 
playing
boston 
at 
the 
clubs. 
With 
an 
incessant 
hum 
of 
voices 
the 
crowd 
advanced
to 
the 
table. 
Pressed 
by 
the 
throng 
against 
the 
high 
backs 
of 
the
chairs, 
the 
orators 
spoke 
one 
after 
another 
and 
sometimes 
two 
together.
Those 
standing 
behind 
noticed 
what 
a 
speaker 
omitted 
to 
say 
and 
hastened
to 
supply 
it.<p>
Others 
in 
that 
heat 
and 
crush 
racked 
their 
brains 
to 
find
some 
thought 
and 
hastened 
to 
utter 
it. 
The 
old 
magnates, 
whom 
Pierre
knew, 
sat 
and 
turned 
to 
look 
first 
at 
one 
and 
then 
at 
another, 
and 
their
faces 
for 
the 
most 
part 
only 
expressed 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
found 
it 
very
hot. 
Pierre, 
however, 
felt 
excited, 
and 
the 
general 
desire 
to 
show 
that
they 
were 
ready 
to 
go 
to 
all 
lengths-which 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
tones
and 
looks 
more 
than 
in 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
speeches-infected 
him 
too.
He 
did 
not 
renounce 
his 
opinions, 
but 
felt 
himself 
in 
some 
way 
to 
blame
and 
wished 
to 
justify 
himself.

"I 
only 
said 
that 
it 
would 
be 
more 
to 
the 
purpose 
to 
make 
sacrifices
when 
we 
know 
what 
is

was 
about, 
went<p>
across 
the 
room<p>
to 
where 
Pierre 
was 
standing 
and 
gave
him 
a 
taper. 
He 
lit 
it 
and, 
distracted 
<a href="/aVzUge/kZ8e24mbEd.html">by</a> 
observing 
those 
around 
him,
began 
crossing 
himself 
with 
the 
hand 
that 
held 
the 
taper.

Sophie, 
the 
rosy, 
laughter-loving, 
youngest 
princess 
with 
the 
mole,
watched 
him. 
She 
smiled, 
hid 
her 
face 
in 
her 
handkerchief, 
and 
remained
with 
it 
hidden 
for 
awhile; 
then 
looking 
up 
and 
seeing 
Pierre 
she
again 
began 
to 
laugh. 
She 
evidently 
felt 
unable 
to 
look 
at 
him
without 
laughing, 
but 
could 
not 
resist 
looking 
at 
him: 
so 
to 
be 
out 
of
temptation 
she 
slipped 
quietly 
behind 
one 
of 
the 
columns. 
In 
the 
midst
of 
the 
service 
the 
voices 
of 
the 
priests 
suddenly 
ceased, 
they 
whispered
to 
one 
another, 
and 
the 
old 
servant 
who 
was 
holding 
the 
count's 
hand
got 
up 
and 
said 
something 
to 
the 
ladies. 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
stepped
forward 
and, 
stooping 
over 
the 
dying 
man, 
beckoned 
to 
Lorrain 
from
behind 
her 
back. 
The 
French 
doctor 
held 
no 
taper; 
he 
was 
leaning
against 
one 
of 
the 
columns 
in 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/FW2mbEd87g.html">respectful</a> 
attitude 
implying 
that 
he,
a 
foreigner, 
in 
spite 
of 
all 
differences 
of 
faith, 
understood 
the 
full
importance 
of 
the 
rite 
now 
being 
performed 
and 
even 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Rx8tTlW7OpC2BwOO.html">approved</a> 
of 
it. 
He
now 
approached 
the 
sick 
man 
with 
the 
noiseless 
step 
of 
one 
in 
full 
vigor
of 
life, 
with 
his 
delicate 
white 
fingers 
raised 
from 
the 
green 
quilt 
the
hand 
that 
was 
free, 
and 
turning 
sideways 
felt 
the 
pulse 
and 
reflected
a 
moment. 
The 
sick 
man 
was 
given 
something 
to 
drink, 
there 
was 
a
stir 
around 
him, 
then 
the 
people 
resumed 
their 
places 
and 
the 
service
continued. 
During 
this 
interval 
Pierre 
noticed 
that 
Prince 
Vasili
left 
the 
chair 
on 
which 
he 
had 
been 
leaning, 
and-with 
an 
air
which 
intimated 
that 
he 
knew 
what 
he<p>
was 
about 
and 
if 
others 
did 
not
understand 
him 
it 
was<p>
so

not 
go 
up 
to 
the
dying 
man, 
but 
passed 
by 
him, 
joined 
the 
eldest 
princess, 
and 
moved
with 
her 
to 
the 
side 
of 
the 
room 
where 
stood 
the 
high 
bedstead 
with 
its
silken 
hangings. 
On 
leaving 
the 
bed 
both 
Prince 
Vasili 
and 
the 
princess
passed 
out 
by 
a 
back 
door, 
but 
returned 
to 
their 
places 
one 
after 
the
other 
before 
the 
service 
was 
concluded. 
Pierre 
paid 
no 
more 
attention
to 
this 
occurrence 
than 
to 
the 
rest 
of 
what 
went 
on, 
having 
made 
up

once 
for 
all

Suddenly

let 
himself 
be

of 
hundreds 
of 
rubles 
every

by 
his 
neighbors, 
who 
looked
upon 
an 
opportunity 
to 
play 
a 
rubber 
with 
Count 
Rostov 
as 
a 
most
profitable 
source 
of 
income.

The 
count 
moved 
in 
his 
affairs 
as 
in 
a 
huge<p>
net, 
trying 
not 
to 
believe
that 
he 
was 
entangled 
but 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
so 
at 
every 
step, 
and
feeling 
too 
feeble 
to 
break 
the 
meshes 
or 
to 
set 
to 
work 
carefully 
and
patiently 
to 
disentangle 
them. 
The 
countess, 
with 
her 
loving 
heart, 
felt
that 
her 
children 
were 
being 
ruined, 
that 
it 
was 
not 
the 
count's 
fault
for 
he 
could 
not 
help 
being 
what 
he 
was-that 
(though 
he 
tried 
to
hide 
it) 
he 
himself 
suffered 
from 
the 
consciousness 
of 
his 
own 
and
his 
children's 
ruin, 
and 
she 
tried 
to<p>
find 
means 
of 
remedying 
the
position. 
From 
her 
feminine 
point 
of 
<a href="/cZl/HQ2YmejJ4e1au.html">view</a> 
she 
could 
see 
only 
one
solution, 
namely, 
for 
Nicholas 
to 
marry 
a 
rich 
heiress. 
She 
felt 
this 
to
be 
their 
last 
hope 
and 
that 
if 
Nicholas 
refused 
the 
match 
she 
had 
found
for 
him, 
she 
would 
have 
to 
abandon 
the 
hope 
of 
ever 
getting 
matters
right. 
This 
match 
was 
with 
Julie 
Karagina, 
the 
daughter 
of 
excellent
and 
virtuous 
parents, 
a 
girl 
the 
Rostovs 
had 
known 
from 
childhood, 
and
who 
had 
now 
become 
a 
wealthy 
heiress 
through 
the 
death 
of 
the 
last 
of
her 
brothers.

The 
countess 
had 
written 
direct 
to 
Julie's 
mother 
in 
Moscow 
suggesting
a 
marriage 
between 
their 
children 
and 
had 
received 
a 
favorable 
answer
from 
her. 
Karagina 
had 
replied 
that 
for 
her 
part 
she 
was 
agreeable, 
and
everything 
depend 
on 
her 
daughter's 
inclination. 
She 
invited 
Nicholas
to 
come 
to 
Moscow.

Several 
times 
the 
countess, 
with 
tears 
in 
her 
eyes, 
told 
her 
son 
that
now 
both 
her 
daughters 
were 
settled, 
her 
only 
wish 
was 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ph3wKMFq9Zd9HI.html">see</a> 
him
married. 
She 
said 
she 
could 
lie 
down 
in 
her 
grave 
peacefully 
if 
that
were 
accomplished. 
Then 
she 
told 
him 
that 
she 
knew 
of 
a 
splendid 
girl
and 
tried 
to 
discover 
what 
he 
thought 
about 
marriage.

At 
other 
times 
she 
praised 
Julie 
to 
him 
and 
advised 
him 
to 
go 
to
Moscow 
during 
the 
holidays 
to 
amuse 
himself. 
Nicholas 
guessed 
what 
his
mother's 
remarks 
were 
<a href="/cZl/nHL3COCd3hQrxS2omA.html">leading</a> 
to 
and 
during 
one 
of<p>
these 
conversations
induced 
her 
to 
speak 
quite 
frankly. 
She 
told 
him 
that 
her 
only 
hope
of 
getting 
their 
affairs 
disentangled 
now 
lay 
in 
his 
marrying 
Julie
Karagina.

And 
I

"The

and 
the

Joseph 
Alexeevich's 
face 
had 
looked 
young
and 
bright. 
That 
day 
I 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
my 
benefactor 
in 
which 
he
wrote 
about 
"conjugal 
duties."


9th 
December

I 
had 
a 
dream 
from 
which 
I 
awoke<p>
with 
a 
throbbing 
heart. 
I 
saw 
that
I 
was 
in 
Moscow 
in 
my 
house, 
in 
the 
big 
sitting 
room, 
and 
Joseph
Alexeevich 
came 
in 
from 
the 
drawing 
room. 
<a href="/cZl/CS7GLq8IDLzm4oOe.html">I</a> 
seemed 
to 
know 
at 
once 
that
the 
process 
of 
regeneration 
had 
already 
taken 
place 
in 
him, 
and 
I 
rushed
to 
meet 
him. 
I 
embraced 
him 
and 
kissed 
his 
hands, 
and 
he 
said, 
"Hast
thou 
noticed 
that 
my 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mS2fY5hQrxS8OgAj.html">face</a>

I 
looked 
at 
him, 
still
holding 
him 
in 
my 
arms, 
and 
saw 
that 
his 
face 
was 
young, 
but 
that 
he
had 
no 
hair 
on 
his 
head 
and 
his 
features 
were 
quite 
changed. 
And<p>
I 
said,
"I 
should 
have 
known 
you 
had 
I 
met 
you 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oUZ59J1bI.html">by</a> 
chance," 
and 
I 
thought 
to
myself, 
"Am 
I 
telling<p>
the 
truth?" 
And 
suddenly 
I 
saw 
him 
lying 
like
a 
dead 
body; 
then 
he 
gradually 
recovered 
and 
went 
with 
me 
into 
my 
study
carrying 
a 
large 
book 
of 
sheets 
of 
drawing 
paper; 
I 
said, 
"I 
drew
that," 
and 
he 
answered 
by 
bowing 
his 
head. 
I 
opened 
the 
book, 
and 
on
all 
the 
pages 
there 
were 
excellent 
drawings. 
And 
in 
my 
dream 
I 
knew
that 
these 
drawings 
represented 
the 
love 
adventures 
of 
the 
soul 
with 
its
beloved. 
And 
on 
its 
pages 
I 
saw 
a 
beautiful 
representation 
of 
a 
maiden
in 
transparent 
garments 
and 
with 
a 
transparent 
body, 
<a href="/cZl/Nh5xp2dAJUS8dJM.html">flying</a> 
up<p>
to 
the
clouds. 
And 
I 
seemed 
to 
know 
that 
this 
maiden 
was 
nothing 
else 
than 
a
representation 
of 
the 
Song 
of 
Songs. 
And 
looking 
at 
those 
drawings 
I
dreamed 
I 
felt 
that 
I 
was 
doing 
wrong, 
but 
could 
not 
tear 
myself 
away
from 
them. 
Lord, 
help 
me! 
My 
God, 
if<p>
Thy 
forsaking 
me 
is 
Thy 
doing, 
Thy
will 
be 
done; 
but 
if 
I 
am

the 
cause, 
teach 
me 
what 
I 
should 
do! 
I

CHAPTER 
XI

The 
Rostovs' 
monetary 
affairs 
had 
not 
improved 
during 
the 
two 
years
they 
had 
spent 
in 
the 
country.

Though 
Nicholas 
Rostov 
had 
kept 
firmly 
to 
his<p>
resolution 
and 
was 
still
serving 
modestly 
in 
an 
obscure 
regiment, 
spending 
comparatively 
little,
the 
way 
of 
life 
at 
Otradnoe-Mitenka's 
management 
of 
affairs, 
in
particular-was 
such 
that 
the 
debts 
inevitably 
increased 
every 
year.
The 
only 
resource 
obviously 
presenting 
itself 
to 
the 
old 
count 
was 
to
apply 
for 
an 
official 
post, 
so 
he 
had 
come 
to 
Petersburg 
to 
look 
for 
one
and 
also, 
as 
he 
said, 
to 
let 
the 
lassies 
enjoy 
themselves 
for 
the 
last
time.

Soon 
after 
their 
arrival 
in 
Petersburg 
Berg 
proposed 
to 
Vera 
and 
was
accepted.

Though 
in 
Moscow 
the 
Rostovs 
belonged 
to 
the 
best 
society 
without
themselves 
giving 
it 
a 
thought, 
yet 
in 
Petersburg 
their 
circle 
of
acquaintances 
was 
a 
mixed 
and 
indefinite 
one. 
In 
Petersburg 
they 
were
provincials,

sacred.

"No, 
but 
why 
do 
you 
think 
so?" 
Pierre<p>
suddenly 
began, 
lowering 
his
head 
and 
looking 
like 
a 
bull 
about 
to 
charge, 
"why 
do 
you 
think 
so?
You 
should 
not 
think 
so."

"Think? 
What 
about?" 
asked 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
surprise.

"About 
life, 
about 
man's 
destiny. 
It 
can't 
be 
so. 
I 
myself 
thought
like 
that, 
and 
do 
you 
know 
what 
saved 
me? 
Freemasonry! 
No, 
don't
smile. 
Freemasonry 
is 
not 
a 
religious 
ceremonial 
sect, 
as 
I 
thought
it 
was: 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
best 
expression 
of 
the 
best, 
the 
eternal,
aspects 
of 
humanity."

And 
he 
began 
to 
explain 
Freemasonry 
as 
he 
understood 
it 
to 
Prince
Andrew. 
He<p>
said 
that 
Freemasonry 
is 
the 
teaching 
of 
Christianity 
freed
from 
the 
bonds 
of 
State 
and 
Church, 
a 
teaching 
of 
equality, 
brotherhood,
and 
love.

"Only 
our 
holy 
brotherhood 
has 
the 
real 
meaning 
of 
life, 
all 
the 
rest
is 
a 
dream," 
said 
Pierre. 
"Understand, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
that 
outside
this 
union 
all 
is 
filled 
with 
deceit 
and 
falsehood 
and 
I 
agree 
with 
you
that 
nothing 
is 
left 
for 
an 
intelligent 
and 
good 
man 
but 
to 
live 
out
his 
life, 
like 
you, 
merely 
trying 
not 
to 
harm 
others. 
But 
make 
our
fundamental 
convictions 
your 
own, 
join 
our 
brotherhood, 
give 
yourself 
up
to 
us, 
let 
yourself 
be 
guided, 
and 
you 
will 
at 
once 
feel 
yourself, 
as 
I
have 
felt 
myself, 
a 
part 
of 
that 
vast 
invisible 
chain 
the 
beginning 
of
which 
is 
hidden<p>
in 
heaven," 
said 
Pierre.

Prince 
Andrew, 
looking 
straight 
in 
front 
of 
him, 
listened 
in 
silence 
to
Pierre's 
words. 
More 
than 
once, 
when 
the 
noise 
of 
the 
wheels 
prevented
his 
catching 
what 
Pierre 
said, 
he 
asked 
him 
to 
repeat 
it, 
and 
by 
the
peculiar<p>
glow 
that 
came 
into 
Prince 
Andrew's 
eyes 
and 
by 
his 
silence,
Pierre 
saw 
that 
his 
words 
were 
not 
in 
vain 
and 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
would
not 
interrupt 
him 
or 
laugh 
at 
what 
he 
said.

They 
reached 
a 
river 
that 
had 
overflowed 
its 
banks 
and 
which

had

As 
soon 
as 
she 
began 
to 
speak 
of 
that, 
her 
lips 
trembled 
and 
her 
tears
began 
to<p>
fall. 
Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
away 
and 
began 
pacing 
the 
room.

"Ah, 
my 
God! 
my 
God! 
When 
one 
thinks 
who 
and 
what-what 
trash-can 
cause
people 
misery!" 
he 
said 
with 
a 
malignity 
that 
alarmed 
Princess 
Mary.

She 
understood 
that 
when 
speaking 
of 
"trash" 
he 
referred 
not 
only 
to
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
the 
cause 
of 
her 
misery, 
but 
also 
to 
the 
man 
who
had 
ruined 
his 
own 
happiness.

"Andrew! 
One 
thing 
I 
beg, 
I 
entreat 
of 
you!" 
she 
said, 
touching 
his
elbow 
and 
looking 
at 
him 
with 
eyes 
that 
shone 
through 
her 
tears. 
"I
understand 
you" 
(she 
looked 
down). 
"Don't 
imagine 
that 
sorrow 
is 
the
work 
of 
men. 
Men<p>
are 
His 
tools." 
She 
looked 
a 
little 
above 
Prince
Andrew's 
head 
with 
the 
confident, 
accustomed 
look 
with 
which 
one 
looks
at 
the 
place 
where 
a 
familiar 
portrait 
hangs. 
"Sorrow 
is 
sent 
by 
Him,
not 
by 
men. 
Men 
are 
His 
instruments, 
they 
are 
not 
to 
blame. 
If 
you 
think
someone 
has 
wronged 
you, 
forget 
it 
and 
forgive! 
We 
have 
no 
right 
to
punish. 
And 
then 
you 
will 
know 
the 
happiness 
of 
forgiving."

"If 
I 
were 
a 
woman 
I 
would 
do 
so, 
Mary. 
That 
is 
a 
woman's 
virtue. 
But
a 
man 
should 
not 
and 
cannot 
forgive 
and 
forget," 
he 
replied, 
and 
though
till 
that 
moment 
he 
had 
not 
been 
thinking 
of 
Kuragin, 
all 
his 
unexpended
anger 
suddenly 
swelled 
up 
in 
his 
heart.

"If 
Mary 
is 
already 
persuading 
me 
to 
forgive, 
it 
means 
that 
I 
ought 
long
ago 
to 
have 
punished 
him," 
he 
thought. 
And 
giving 
her 
no 
further 
reply,
he 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bfW1mbEd8npky.html">began</a> 
thinking 
of 
the 
glad 
vindictive 
moment 
when 
he 
would 
meet
Kuragin 
who 
he 
knew 
was 
now 
in 
the 
army.

Princess 
Mary 
begged 
him 
to 
stay 
one 
day 
more, 
saying 
that 
she 
knew 
how
unhappy 
her 
father 
would 
be 
if 
Andrew 
left 
without 
being 
reconciled 
to
him, 
but 
Prince 
Andrew 
replied 
that 
he 
would 
probably 
soon 
be 
back 
again
from 
the 
army 
and 
would 
certainly 
write 
to 
his 
father, 
but 
that 
the
longer 
he 
stayed 
now 
the 
more 
embittered 
their 
differences 
would 
become.

"Good-by, 
Andrew! 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Pe553SwJMI.html">Remember</a> 
that 
misfortunes 
come 
from 
God,

were 
the

words 
he 
heard 
from

took

her.

"Then 
it

thought 
Prince

drove 
out 
of

Natasha.

she

the

in

quiet

which 
generally 
culminated 
in 
a

she
went 
about

that 
morning 
as 
though 
facing 
a 
cocked 
and 
loaded 
gun
and 
awaited 
the<p>
inevitable 
explosion. 
Until 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/NhF3gdRt8E.html">doctor's</a> 
arrival 
the
morning 
had 
passed 
off 
safely. 
After

Princess

sat</a> 
down

could

To 
force 
the 
guard.

At 
first 
she 
heard 
only 
Metivier's 
voice, 
then 
her 
father's, 
then
both 
voices 
began 
speaking 
at 
the 
same 
time, 
the 
door 
was 
flung 
open,
and 
on 
the 
threshold 
appeared 
the 
handsome 
figure 
of 
the 
terrified
Metivier 
with 
his 
shock 
of 
black 
hair, 
and 
the 
prince 
in 
his 
dressing
gown 
and 
fez, 
his 
face 
distorted 
with 
fury 
and 
the 
pupils 
of 
his 
eyes
rolled 
downwards.

"You 
don't 
understand?" 
shouted 
the 
prince, 
"but 
I 
do! 
French
spy, 
slave 
of 
Buonaparte, 
spy, 
get 
out 
of 
my 
house! 
Be 
off, 
I 
tell
you..." 
and 
he 
slammed 
the 
door.

Metivier, 
shrugging 
his 
shoulders, 
went 
up 
to 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne
who 
at 
the 
sound 
of 
shouting 
had 
run 
in 
from 
an 
adjoining 
room.

"The 
prince 
is 
not 
very 
well: 
bile 
and 
rush 
of 
blood 
to 
the 
head. 
Keep
calm, 
I 
will 
call 
again 
tomorrow," 
said 
Metivier; 
and 
putting 
his
fingers 
to 
his 
lips 
he 
hastened 
away.

Through 
the 
study 
door 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
slippered 
feet 
and 
the 
cry:
"Spies, 
traitors, 
traitors 
everywhere! 
Not 
a 
moment's 
peace 
in 
my
own 
house!"

After 
Metivier's 
departure 
the 
old 
prince 
called 
his 
daughter 
in, 
and
the 
whole 
weight 
of 
his 
wrath 
fell 
on 
her. 
She 
was 
to 
blame 
that 
a 
spy
had 
been 
admitted. 
Had 
he 
not 
told 
her, 
yes, 
told 
her 
to 
make 
a 
list,
and 
not 
to 
admit 
anyone 
who 
was 
not 
on 
that 
list? 
Then 
why 
was 
that
scoundrel 
admitted? 
She 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
it 
all. 
With 
her, 
he 
said, 
he
could 
not 
have 
a 
moment's 
peace 
and 
could 
not 
die 
quietly.

"No, 
ma'am! 
We 
must 
part, 
we 
must 
part! 
Understand 
that, 
understand
it! 
I 
cannot 
endure 
any 
more," 
he 
said, 
and 
left 
the 
room. 
Then, 
as 
if
afraid 
she 
might 
find 
some 
means 
of 
consolation, 
he 
returned 
and 
trying
to 
appear 
calm 
added: 
"And 
don't 
imagine 
I 
have 
said 
this 
in 
a
moment

anger. 
I 
am

I

and<p>
it 
will 
be
carried 
out-we 
must 
part; 
so 
find 
some 
place

yourself...." 
But
he 
could 
not 
restrain 
himself 
and 
with 
the 
virulence 
of 
which 
only 
one
who 
loves 
is 
capable, 
evidently 
suffering 
himself,<p>
he 
shook 
his 
fists 
at
her 
and 
screamed:

"If

her!" 
Then 
he 
slammed 
the 
door, 
sent
for 
Mademoiselle

and 
subsided 
into 
his 
study.

At 
two 
o'clock

well 
written," 
said 
Tushin, 
"but 
that's 
not
the 
point, 
Vasili 
Dmitrich," 
and 
he 
also 
turned 
to 
Rostov. 
"One
has 
to 
submit, 
and 
Vasili 
Dmitrich 
doesn't 
want 
to. 
You 
know 
the
auditor 
told 
you 
it 
was 
a 
bad 
business."

"Well, 
let 
it 
be 
bad," 
said 
Denisov.

"The 
auditor 
wrote 
out 
a 
petition 
for 
you," 
continued 
Tushin,
"and 
you 
ought 
to 
sign 
it 
and 
ask 
this 
gentleman 
to 
take 
it. 
No 
doubt
he" 
(indicating 
Rostov) 
"has 
connections 
on 
the 
staff. 
You 
won't
find 
a 
better 
opportunity."

"Haven't 
I 
said 
I'm 
not 
going 
to 
gwovel?" 
Denisov 
interrupted
him, 
went 
on 
reading 
his 
paper.

Rostov 
had 
not 
the 
courage 
to 
persuade 
Denisov, 
though 
he
instinctively 
felt 
that 
the 
way 
advised 
by 
Tushin 
and 
the 
other
officers 
was 
the 
safest, 
and 
though 
he<p>
would 
have 
been 
glad 
to 
be 
of
service 
to 
Denisov. 
He 
knew 
his 
stubborn 
will 
and 
straightforward 
hasty
temper.

When 
the 
reading 
of 
Denisov's 
virulent 
reply, 
which 
took 
more 
than<p>
an
hour, 
was 
over, 
Rostov 
said 
nothing, 
and 
he 
spent 
the 
rest 
of 
the 
day
in 
a 
most 
dejected 
state 
of 
mind 
amid 
Denisov's 
hospital 
comrades,
who 
had 
gathered 
round 
him, 
telling 
them 
what 
he 
knew 
and 
listening 
to
their 
stories. 
Denisov 
was 
moodily 
silent 
all 
the 
evening.

Late 
in 
the 
evening, 
when 
Rostov 
was 
about 
to 
leave, 
he 
asked 
Denisov
whether 
he 
had 
no 
commission 
for 
him.

"Yes, 
wait 
a 
bit," 
said 
Denisov, 
glancing 
round 
at 
the 
officers,
and 
taking 
his<p>
papers 
from 
under 
his 
pillow 
he 
went 
to 
the 
window,<p>
where
he 
had 
an 
inkpot, 
and 
sat 
down 
to 
write.

"It 
seems 
it's 
no 
use 
knocking 
one's 
head 
against 
a 
wall!" 
he
said, 
coming 
from 
the 
window 
and 
giving 
Rostov 
a 
large 
<a href="/cZl/fF76zlSDj1rFtA.html">envelope.</a> 
In
it 
was 
the 
petition 
to 
the 
Emperor 
drawn 
up 
by 
the 
auditor, 
in
which 
Denisov, 
without 
alluding 
to 
the 
offenses 
of 
the 
commissariat
officials, 
simply 
asked 
for 
pardon.

"Hand 
it 
in. 
It 
seems..."

He 
did 
not 
finish, 
but 
gave 
a 
painfully 
unnatural 
smile.

(he
pointed 
to 
the 
assistant),

Some

When

said 
the 
doctor 
with 
evident 
satisfaction. 
"Prussian<p>
doctors 
have 
been
invited 
here, 
but 
our 
allies 
don't 
like 
it 
at 
all."

Rostov 
explained<p>
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
see 
Major 
Denisov 
of 
the 
hussars,
who 
was 
wounded.

"I 
don't 
know. 
I 
can't 
tell 
you, 
sir. 
Only 
think! 
I 
am 
alone 
in
charge 
of 
three 
hospitals 
with 
more 
than 
four 
hundred 
patients! 
It's
well 
that 
the 
charitable 
Prussian 
ladies 
send 
us 
two 
pounds 
of 
coffee
and 
some 
lint 
each 
month 
or 
we 
should 
be 
lost!" 
he 
laughed. 
"Four
hundred, 
sir, 
and 
they're 
always 
sending 
me 
fresh 
ones. 
There 
are 
four
hundred? 
Eh?" 
he 
asked, 
turning 
to 
the 
assistant.

The 
assistant 
looked 
fagged 
out. 
He 
was 
evidently 
vexed 
and 
impatient
for 
the 
talkative 
doctor 
to 
go.

"Major 
Denisov," 
Rostov 
said 
again. 
"He 
was 
wounded 
at
Molliten."

"Dead, 
I 
fancy. 
Eh, 
Makeev?" 
queried 
the 
doctor, 
in 
a 
tone 
of
indifference.

The 
assistant, 
however, 
did 
not 
confirm 
the 
doctor's 
words.

"Is 
he<p>
tall 
and 
with 
reddish 
hair?" 
asked 
the 
doctor.

Rostov 
described 
Denisov's 
appearance.

"There 
was 
one 
like 
that," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
as 
if 
pleased. 
"That
one 
is 
dead, 
I 
fancy. 
However, 
I'll<p>
look 
up 
our 
list. 
We 
had 
a 
list.
Have 
you 
got 
it, 
Makeev?"

"Makar<p>
Alexeevich 
has 
the 
list,"<p>
answered 
the 
assistant. 
"But 
if
you'll 
step 
into 
the 
officers' 
wards 
you'll 
see 
for 
yourself,"
he 
added, 
turning 
to 
Rostov.

"Ah, 
you'd 
better 
not 
go, 
sir," 
said 
the 
doctor, 
"or 
you 
may
have 
to 
stay 
here 
yourself."

But 
Rostov 
bowed 
himself 
away 
from 
the 
doctor 
and 
asked 
the 
assistant
to 
show 
him 
the 
way.

"Only 
don't 
blame 
me!" 
the 
doctor 
shouted 
up 
after 
him.

Rostov 
and 
the 
assistant 
went<p>
into 
the 
dark 
corridor. 
The 
smell 
was 
so
strong 
there 
that 
Rostov 
held 
his 
nose 
and 
had 
to 
pause 
and 
collect
his 
strength 
before 
he 
could 
go 
on. 
A 
door 
opened 
to 
the 
right, 
and 
an
emaciated 
sallow 
man 
on 
crutches, 
barefoot 
and 
in 
underclothing, 
limped
out 
and, 
leaning 
against 
the<p>
doorpost, 
looked 
with 
glittering 
envious
eyes 
at 
those 
who 
were 
passing. 
Glancing 
in 
at 
the 
door, 
Rostov
saw 
that 
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
were 
lying 
on 
the 
floor 
on 
straw 
and
overcoats.

"May 
I 
go 
in 
and 
look?"

"What 
is 
there 
to 
see?" 
said 
the 
assistant.

But, 
just 
because 
the 
assistant 
evidently 
did 
not 
want 
him 
to 
go 
in,
Rostov 
entered 
the 
soldiers' 
ward. 
The 
foul 
air, 
to 
which 
he 
had
already 
begun 
to 
get 
used 
in 
the 
corridor, 
was 
still 
stronger 
here. 
It
was 
a 
little 
different, 
more 
pungent, 
and 
one 
felt 
that 
this 
was 
where
it 
originated.

In 
the 
long 
room, 
brightly 
lit 
up 
by 
the 
sun 
through 
the 
large 
windows,
the 
sick 
and 
wounded 
lay 
in 
two 
rows 
with 
their 
heads 
to 
the 
walls, 
and
leaving 
a 
passage 
in 
the 
middle. 
Most 
of 
them 
were 
unconscious 
and
paid 
no 
attention 
to 
the 
newcomers. 
Those 
who 
were 
conscious 
raised
themselves 
or 
lifted 
their 
thin 
yellow 
faces, 
and 
all 
looked 
intently 
at
Rostov 
with 
the 
same 
expression 
of 
hope, 
of 
relief, 
reproach, 
and
envy 
of 
another's 
health. 
Rostov 
went 
to 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
and
looking 
through 
the 
open 
doors 
into 
the 
two 
adjoining 
rooms 
saw 
the 
same
thing 
there. 
He 
stood 
still, 
looking 
silently 
around. 
He 
had 
not 
at 
all
expected 
such 
a 
sight. 
Just 
before 
him, 
almost 
across 
the 
middle<p>
of 
the
passage 
on 
the 
bare 
floor, 
lay 
a 
sick 
man, 
probably 
a 
Cossack 
to 
judge
by 
the 
cut 
of 
his 
hair. 
The 
man 
lay 
on 
his 
back, 
his 
huge 
arms 
and

with 
the 
pale 
and 
terrified 
Ober-Hofmarschal
Count 
Tolstoy, 
who 
had 
ridden 
out 
to 
the 
battlefield 
with 
others 
in
the 
Emperor's 
suite. 
One 
officer 
told 
Rostov 
that 
he 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">had</a> 
seen 
someone
from 
headquarters 
behind 
the 
village 
to 
the 
left, 
and 
thither 
Rostov
rode, 
not 
hoping 
to 
find 
anyone 
but 
merely 
to 
ease 
his 
conscience. 
When
he 
had 
ridden 
about 
two 
miles 
and 
had 
passed 
the 
last 
of 
the 
Russian
troops, 
he 
saw, 
near 
a 
kitchen 
garden 
with 
a 
ditch 
round 
it, 
two 
men
on 
horseback 
facing 
the 
ditch. 
One 
with 
a 
white 
plume 
in 
his 
hat 
seemed
familiar 
to 
Rostov; 
the 
other 
on 
a 
beautiful 
chestnut 
horse 
(which
Rostov 
fancied 
he 
had 
seen 
before) 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
ditch, 
struck 
his
horse 
with 
his 
spurs, 
and 
giving 
it 
the 
rein 
leaped 
lightly 
over. 
Only
a 
little 
earth 
crumbled 
from 
the 
bank 
under 
the 
horse's 
hind<p>
hoofs.
Turning 
the 
horse 
sharply, 
he 
again 
jumped 
the 
ditch, 
and 
deferentially
addressed 
the 
horseman 
with 
the 
white 
plumes, 
evidently 
suggesting
that 
he 
should 
do 
the 
same. 
The 
rider, 
whose 
figure 
seemed 
familiar
to 
Rostov 
and 
involuntarily 
riveted 
his 
attention, 
made 
a 
gesture 
of
refusal 
with 
his 
head 
and 
hand 
and 
by 
that 
gesture 
Rostov 
instantly
recognized 
his 
lamented 
and 
adored 
monarch.

"But 
it 
can't 
be 
he, 
alone 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
this 
empty 
field!"
thought<p>
Rostov. 
At 
that 
moment 
Alexander 
turned 
his 
head 
and 
Rostov
saw 
the 
beloved 
features 
that 
were 
<a href="/aVzUge/kH5ieWTn1Qc1on.html">so</a> 
deeply 
engraved 
on 
his 
memory. 
The
Emperor 
was 
pale, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/HhG4Uijd0SC.html">his</a> 
cheeks 
sunken 
and 
his 
eyes 
hollow, 
but 
the 
charm,
the 
mildness 
of 
his 
features, 
was 
all 
the 
greater. 
Rostov 
was 
happy
in 
the 
assurance 
that 
<a href="/aVzUge/uqv2NY3epgGc3jl.html">the</a> 
rumors 
about 
the 
Emperor 
being

were
false. 
He 
was

opened

the 
Emperor, 
and 
he 
spoke

enthusiastically. 
The

speech 
had 
been 
extraordinary. 
It 
had 
been 
a 
speech 
such 
as
only 
constitutional 
monarchs 
deliver. 
"The 
Sovereign 
plainly 
said
that

he 
said 
that 
the

must 
rest 
not

on 
secure 
bases. 
The 
Emperor
said 
that 
the 
fiscal

must 
be 
reorganized 
and 
the 
accounts
published," 
recounted 
Bitski, 
emphasizing 
certain 
words 
and 
opening
his 
eyes 
significantly.

"Ah, 
yes! 
Today's 
events 
mark 
an 
epoch, 
the 
greatest 
epoch 
in 
our
history," 
he 
concluded.

Prince 
Andrew 
listened 
to 
the<p>
account 
of 
the 
opening 
of 
the 
Council 
of
State, 
which 
he 
had 
so 
impatiently 
awaited 
and 
to 
which 
he 
had 
attached
such 
importance, 
and 
was 
surprised 
that 
this 
event, 
now 
that 
it 
had
taken 
place, 
did 
not 
affect 
him, 
and 
even 
seemed 
quite 
insignificant. 
He
listened 
with 
quiet 
irony 
to 
Bitski's 
enthusiastic 
account 
of 
it. 
A
very 
simple 
thought 
occurred 
to 
him: 
"What 
does 
it 
matter 
to 
me 
or 
to
Bitski 
what 
the 
Emperor 
was 
pleased 
to 
say 
at 
the 
Council? 
Can 
all 
that
make 
me 
any 
happier 
or 
better?"

And 
this 
simple 
reflection 
suddenly 
destroyed 
all 
the 
interest 
Prince
Andrew 
had 
felt 
in 
the 
impending 
reforms. 
He 
was 
going 
to 
dine 
that
evening 
at 
Speranski's, 
"with 
only 
a 
few<p>
friends," 
as 
the 
host
had 
said 
when 
inviting 
him. 
The 
prospect 
of 
that 
dinner 
in 
the 
intimate
home 
circle 
of 
the 
man 
he 
so 
admired 
had 
greatly 
interested 
Prince
Andrew, 
especially 
as 
he 
had 
not 
yet 
seen 
Speranski 
in 
his 
domestic
surroundings, 
but 
now 
he 
felt 
disinclined 
to 
go 
to 
it.

At 
the 
appointed 
hour, 
however, 
he 
entered 
the 
modest 
house 
Speranski
owned 
in 
the 
Taurida 
Gardens. 
In 
the 
parqueted 
dining 
room 
of 
this 
small
house, 
remarkable 
for 
its 
extreme 
cleanliness 
(suggesting 
that 
of 
a
monastery), 
Prince 
Andrew, 
who 
was 
rather 
late, 
found 
the 
friendly
gathering

<a href="/aVzUge/dK66vtfU3J.html">Pierre</a> 
for 
the 
first 
time 
felt 
humiliated 
by 
the 
position
his 
wife 
<a href="/cZl/ywm6OHGoa72ZNkA.html">occupied</a> 
in 
court 
circles. 
He 
was 
gloomy 
and 
absent-minded. 
A
deep 
furrow 
ran 
across 
his 
forehead, 
and 
standing 
by 
a 
window 
he 
stared
over 
his 
spectacles 
seeing 
no 
one.

On 
her 
way 
to 
supper 
Natasha 
passed 
him.

Pierre's 
gloomy, 
unhappy 
look 
struck 
her. 
She 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
him.
She 
wished 
to 
help 
him, 
to 
bestow 
on 
him 
the 
superabundance 
of 
her 
own
happiness.

"How 
delightful 
it 
is, 
Count!" 
said 
she. 
"Isn't 
it?"

Pierre 
smiled 
absent-mindedly, 
evidently 
not 
grasping 
what 
she 
said.

"Yes, 
I 
am 
very 
glad," 
<a href="/aVzUge/WJ8VwPy16QtfEB.html">he</a> 
said.

"How 
can 
people 
be 
dissatisfied 
with 
anything?" 
thought 
Natasha.
"Especially 
such 
a 
capital 
fellow 
as 
Bezukhov!" 
In 
Natasha's
eyes 
all 
the 
people 
at 
the 
ball 
alike 
were 
good, 
kind, 
and 
splendid
people, 
loving 
one 
another; 
none 
of 
them 
capable 
of 
injuring
another-and 
so 
they 
ought 
all 
to 
be 
happy.





CHAPTER

Next

Prince 
Andrew 
thought 
of 
the 
ball, 
but 
his 
mind 
did 
not 
dwell
on 
it 
long. 
"Yes, 
it 
was 
a 
very 
brilliant

and 
then... 
"Yes,

CHAPTER 
X

Natasha 
had 
married 
in 
the 
early 
spring 
of 
1813, 
and 
in 
1820 
already 
<a href="/aVzUge/mu9vWPe2NSUp3wNlRn.html">had
three</a> 
daughters 
besides 
a 
son 
for 
whom 
she 
had 
longed 
and 
whom 
she 
was
now 
nursing. 
She 
had 
grown 
stouter 
and 
broader, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
difficult
to 
recognize 
in 
this 
robust, 
motherly 
woman 
the 
slim, 
lively 
Natasha 
of
former 
days. 
Her 
features 
were 
more 
defined 
and 
had 
a 
calm, 
soft,
and 
serene 
expression. 
In 
her 
face 
there 
was 
none 
of 
the 
ever-glowing
animation 
that 
had 
formerly 
burned 
there 
and 
constituted 
its 
charm.
Now 
her 
face 
and 
body 
were 
often 
all 
that 
one 
saw, 
and 
her 
soul 
was
not 
visible 
at 
all. 
All 
that 
struck 
the 
eye 
was<p>
a 
strong, 
handsome, 
and
fertile 
woman. 
The 
old 
fire 
very 
rarely 
kindled 
in 
her 
face 
now. 
That
happened 
only 
when, 
as 
was 
the 
case 
that 
day, 
her 
husband 
returned 
home,
or 
a 
sick 
child 
was 
convalescent, 
or 
when 
she 
and 
Countess 
Mary 
spoke 
of
Prince 
Andrew 
(she 
never 
mentioned 
him 
to 
her 
husband, 
who 
she 
imagined
was 
jealous 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
memory), 
or 
on 
the 
rare 
occasions 
when
something 
happened 
to 
induce 
her 
to 
sing, 
a 
practice 
she 
had 
quite
abandoned 
since 
her 
marriage. 
At 
the 
rare 
moments 
when 
the 
old 
fire
did 
kindle 
in 
her 
handsome, 
fully 
developed<p>
body 
she 
was 
even 
more
attractive 
than 
in 
former 
days.

Since 
their 
marriage 
Natasha 
and 
her 
husband 
had 
lived 
in 
Moscow, 
in
Petersburg, 
on 
their 
estate 
near 
Moscow, 
or 
with 
her 
mother, 
that 
is 
to
say,

of 
what
was 
there 
on 
the 
hilltop, 
and 
kept 
constantly 
looking 
at 
the

the 
skyline, 
which 
they 
knew 
to<p>
be 
<a href="/cZl/UrT8C9b1.html">the</a>

The 
weather 
had 
cleared 
again 
since 
noon 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Ly7t1f4hK.html">the</a> 
sun 
was 
descending
brightly 
upon 
the 
Danube 
and 
the 
dark 
hills 
around 
it. 
It 
was 
calm, 
and
at 
intervals 
the 
bugle 
calls 
and 
the 
shouts 
of 
the 
enemy 
could 
be 
heard
from 
the 
hill. 
There 
was 
no 
one 
now 
between 
the 
squadron 
and 
the 
enemy
except 
a 
few 
scattered 
skirmishers. 
An 
empty 
space 
of 
some 
seven 
hundred
yards 
was 
all 
that 
separated 
them. 
The 
enemy 
ceased 
firing, 
and 
that
stern, 
threatening, 
inaccessible, 
and 
intangible 
line 
which 
separates
two 
hostile 
armies 
was 
all 
the 
more 
clearly 
felt.

"One 
step 
beyond<p>
that 
boundary 
line 
which 
resembles 
the 
line 
dividing
the 
living 
from 
the 
dead 
lies 
uncertainty, 
suffering, 
and 
death. 
And
what 
is 
there? 
Who 
is 
there?-there 
beyond 
that 
field, 
that 
tree, 
that
roof 
lit 
up 
by 
the 
sun? 
No 
one 
knows, 
but 
one 
wants 
to 
know. 
You 
fear
and 
yet 
long 
to 
cross<p>
that 
line, 
and 
know 
that 
sooner 
or 
later 
it 
must
be 
crossed 
and 
you 
will 
have 
to 
find 
out 
what 
is 
there, 
just 
as 
you 
will
inevitably 
have 
to 
learn 
what 
lies 
the 
other 
side 
of 
death. 
But 
you 
are
strong, 
healthy, 
cheerful, 
and 
excited, 
and 
are 
surrounded 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/CF8pAy3cLYU4Z.html">by</a> 
other 
such
excitedly 
animated 
and 
healthy 
men." 
So 
thinks, 
or 
at 
any 
rate
feels, 
anyone 
who 
comes 
in 
sight 
of 
the 
enemy, 
and 
that 
feeling 
gives
a 
particular 
glamour 
and 
glad 
keenness 
of 
impression 
to 
everything 
that
takes 
place 
at 
such 
moments.

On 
the 
high 
ground 
where 
the 
enemy 
was, 
the 
smoke 
of 
a 
cannon 
rose,
and 
a 
ball 
flew 
whistling 
over 
the 
heads 
of 
the 
hussar 
squadron. 
The
officers 
who 
had 
been 
standing 
together 
rode 
off 
to 
their<p>
places. 
The
hussars 
began 
carefully 
aligning 
their 
horses. 
Silence 
fell 
on 
the 
whole
squadron. 
All 
were 
looking 
at 
the 
enemy 
in 
front 
and 
at 
the 
squadron
commander, 
awaiting 
the 
word 
of 
command. 
A 
second 
and 
a 
third 
cannon

flew 
past. 
Evidently 
they 
were 
firing 
<a href="/cZl/fF76zlSDj1rFtA.html">at</a>

and 
he 
indicated 
with 
his 
delicate 
fingers 
what 
he 
meant 
by 
a 
pinch.

"Dere

added 
in 
a 
whisper.

"It 
von't

replied 
the 
German 
with 
a 
smile.

Everyone 
again 
looked 
toward 
the 
door, 
<a href="/cZl/UrT8C9b1.html">which</a> 
creaked 
as 
the 
second
princess 
went 
in 
with 
the 
drink 
she 
had 
prepared 
according 
to
Lorrain's 
instructions. 
The 
German 
doctor 
went 
up 
to 
Lorrain.

"Do 
you 
think 
he 
can 
last 
till 
morning?" 
asked 
the 
German,
addressing 
Lorrain 
in 
French 
which 
he 
pronounced 
badly.

Lorrain, 
pursing 
up 
his 
lips, 
waved 
a 
severely 
negative 
finger 
before
his 
nose.

"Tonight, 
not 
later," 
said 
he 
in 
a 
low 
voice, 
and 
he 
moved 
away
with 
a 
decorous 
smile 
of 
self-satisfaction 
at 
being 
able 
clearly 
to
understand 
and 
state 
the 
patient's 
condition.

Meanwhile 
Prince 
Vasili 
had 
opened 
the 
door<p>
into 
the 
princess' 
room.

In<p>
this 
room 
it 
was 
almost 
dark; 
only 
two 
tiny 
lamps 
were 
burning 
before
the 
icons 
and 
there 
was 
a 
pleasant 
scent 
of 
flowers 
and 
burnt 
pastilles.
The 
room 
was 
crowded 
with 
small 
pieces 
of 
furniture, 
whatnots,
cupboards, 
and 
little 
tables. 
The 
quilt 
of 
a 
high, 
white 
feather 
bed 
was
just 
visible 
behind 
a 
screen. 
A 
small 
dog 
began 
to 
bark.

"Ah, 
is 
it 
you, 
cousin?"

She 
rose 
and 
smoothed 
her 
hair, 
which 
was 
as 
usual 
so 
extremely 
smooth
that 
it 
seemed 
to 
be 
made 
of 
one 
piece 
with 
her<p>
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Yv7tA1IgdEd9UybKc.html">head</a> 
and 
covered 
with
varnish.

"Has 
anything 
happened?" 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vi2Pe7QJprO9e.html">she</a> 
asked. 
"I 
am 
so

"No, 
there

I 
only

to 
have 
a

about

* 
muttered 
the 
prince, 
seating<p>
himself 
wearily 
on 
the 
chair
she 
had 
just 
vacated. 
"You 
have 
made 
the 
place 
warm, 
I 
must 
say," 
he
remarked. 
"Well, 
sit 
down: 
let's 
have 
a 
talk."

 
 
 
 
 
*Catherine.

"I 
thought 
perhaps 
something 
had 
happened," 
she 
said 
with 
her
unchanging 
stonily 
severe 
expression; 
and, 
sitting 
<a href="/cZl/uI3zT3Dj7dS.html">down</a> 
opposite 
the
prince, 
she 
prepared 
to 
listen.

"I 
wished 
to 
get 
a 
nap, 
mon 
cousin, 
but 
I 
can't."

"Well, 
my 
dear?" 
said 
Prince 
Vasili, 
taking 
her 
hand 
and 
bending 
it
downwards 
as 
was 
his 
habit.

It 
was 
plain 
that 
this 
"well?" 
referred 
to 
much 
that 
they 
both
understood 
without 
naming.

The 
princess, 
who 
had 
a 
straight, 
rigid 
body, 
abnormally 
long 
for 
her
legs, 
looked 
directly 
at 
Prince 
Vasili 
with 
no 
sign 
of 
emotion 
in 
her
prominent 
gray 
eyes. 
Then 
she 
shook 
her 
head 
and 
glanced 
up 
at 
the 
icons
with 
a 
sigh. 
This 
might 
have 
been 
taken 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
sorrow
and 
devotion, 
or 
of 
weariness 
and 
<a href="/cZl/RWI879PvrsB.html">hope</a> 
of 
resting 
before 
long. 
Prince
Vasili 
understood 
it 
as 
an 
expression 
of 
weariness.

"And 
I?" 
he 
said; 
"do 
you 
think 
it 
is 
easier 
for 
me? 
I 
am 
as 
worn
out 
as 
a 
post 
horse, 
but 
still 
I 
must 
have 
a 
talk 
with 
you, 
Catiche, 
a
very 
serious 
talk."

Prince 
Vasili 
said 
no 
more 
and 
his 
cheeks 
began 
to 
twitch 
nervously,
now 
on 
one 
side, 
now 
on 
the 
other, 
giving 
his 
face 
an 
unpleasant
expression 
which 
was 
never

in

he 
pitied 
his 
friend 
the 
more 
did 
he 
think 
with 
contempt 
and 
even 
with
disgust 
of 
that 
Natasha 
who 
had 
just 
passed 
him 
in 
the 
ballroom 
with
such 
a 
look 
of 
cold 
dignity. 
He 
did 
not 
know 
that 
Natasha's 
soul 
was
overflowing 
with 
despair, 
shame, 
and 
humiliation, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
not
her 
fault 
that 
her 
face 
happened 
to 
assume 
an 
expression 
of 
calm 
dignity
and 
severity.

"But 
how 
get 
married?" 
said 
Pierre, 
in 
answer<p>
to 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"He
could 
not 
marry-he 
is 
married!"

"Things 
get 
worse 
from 
hour 
to 
hour!" 
ejaculated 
Marya 
Dmitrievna. 
"A
nice 
youth! 
What 
a 
scoundrel! 
And<p>
she's 
expecting 
him-expecting 
him
since 
yesterday. 
She 
must 
be 
told! 
Then 
at 
least 
she 
won't 
go 
on
expecting 
him."

After 
hearing 
the 
details 
of 
Anatole's 
marriage 
from 
Pierre, 
and 
giving
vent 
to 
her 
anger 
against 
Anatole 
in 
words 
of 
abuse, 
Marya 
Dmitrievna
told<p>
Pierre 
why 
she 
had 
sent 
for 
him. 
She 
was 
afraid 
that 
the 
count 
or
Bolkonski, 
who 
might 
arrive 
at 
any 
moment, 
if 
they 
knew 
of 
this 
affair
(which 
she 
hoped 
to 
hide 
from 
them) 
might 
challenge 
Anatole 
to 
a 
duel,
and 
she 
therefore 
asked 
Pierre 
to 
tell 
his 
brother-in-law 
in 
her 
name 
to
leave 
Moscow 
and 
not 
dare 
to 
let 
her 
set 
eyes 
on 
him 
again. 
Pierre-only
now 
realizing 
the 
danger 
to 
the 
old 
count, 
Nicholas, 
and 
Prince
Andrew-promised 
to 
do

"There

Breathless

was 
going

Pierre, 
however, 
seized

She 
screamed

little 
hands

pull 
Pierre's
hands 
away

repulsion 
such 
as 
he

"Wait

you 
fellows.... 
Here 
is
Petya! 
Good 
man!" 
cried 
he, 
addressing 
Pierre.

Another 
voice,<p>
from 
a 
man 
of 
medium 
height 
with 
clear 
blue 
eyes,
particularly 
striking 
among 
all 
these 
drunken 
voices 
by 
its 
sober
ring, 
cried 
from 
the 
window: 
"Come 
here; 
part 
the 
bets!" 
This 
was
Dolokhov, 
an 
officer 
of 
the 
Semenov 
regiment, 
a 
notorious 
gambler 
and
duelist, 
who 
was 
living 
with 
Anatole. 
Pierre 
smiled, 
looking 
about 
him
merrily.

"I 
don't 
understand. 
What's 
it 
all 
about?"

"Wait 
a 
bit, 
he 
is 
not 
drunk 
yet! 
A 
bottle 
here," 
said 
Anatole, 
and
taking 
a 
glass 
from 
the 
table 
he 
went 
up 
to 
Pierre.

"First 
of 
all 
you 
must 
drink!"

Pierre 
drank 
one 
glass 
after 
another, 
looking 
from 
under 
his 
brows 
at
the 
tipsy 
guests 
who 
were 
again 
crowding 
round 
the 
window, 
and 
listening
to 
their 
chatter. 
Anatole 
kept 
on 
refilling 
Pierre's 
glass 
while
explaining 
that 
Dolokhov 
was 
betting 
with 
Stevens, 
an 
English 
naval
officer, 
that 
he 
would 
drink 
a 
bottle 
of 
rum 
sitting 
on 
the 
outer 
ledge
of<p>
the 
third 
floor 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dd9XZEHJ3g8CKMN.html">window</a> 
with 
his 
legs 
hanging 
out.

"Go 
on, 
you 
must 
drink<p>
it 
all," 
said 
Anatole, 
giving 
Pierre 
the 
last
glass, 
"or 
I 
won't 
let 
you 
go!"

"No, 
I 
won't," 
said 
Pierre, 
pushing 
Anatole 
aside, 
and 
he 
went 
up
to 
the 
window.

Dolokhov 
was 
holding 
the 
Englishman's 
hand 
and 
clearly 
and 
distinctly
repeating 
the 
terms 
of 
the 
bet, 
addressing 
himself 
particularly 
to
Anatole 
and 
Pierre.

Dolokhov 
was 
of 
medium 
height, 
with 
curly 
hair 
and 
light-blue 
eyes. 
He
was 
about 
twenty-five. 
Like 
all 
infantry 
officers 
he 
wore 
no 
mustache,
so 
that 
his 
mouth, 
the 
most 
striking 
feature 
of 
his 
face, 
was 
clearly
seen. 
The 
lines 
of 
that 
mouth 
were 
remarkably 
finely 
curved. 
The 
middle
of 
the<p>
upper 
lip 
formed 
a 
sharp 
wedge 
and 
closed 
firmly 
on 
the 
firm
lower 
one, 
and 
something 
like 
two 
distinct 
smiles 
played 
continually
round 
the 
two 
corners 
of 
the 
mouth; 
this, 
together 
with 
the 
resolute,
insolent 
intelligence 
of 
his 
eyes, 
produced 
an 
effect 
which 
made 
it
impossible 
not 
to 
notice 
his 
face. 
Dolokhov 
was 
a 
man 
of 
small 
means
and 
no 
connections. 
Yet, 
though 
Anatole 
spent 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of
rubles, 
Dolokhov 
lived 
with 
him 
and 
had 
placed 
himself 
on 
such 
a
footing 
that 
all 
who 
knew 
them, 
including 
Anatole 
himself, 
respected 
him
more 
than 
they 
did 
Anatole. 
Dolokhov 
could 
play 
all 
games 
and 
nearly
always 
won. 
However 
much 
he 
drank, 
he 
never 
lost 
his 
clearheadedness.
Both 
Kuragin 
and 
Dolokhov 
were 
at 
that 
time 
notorious 
among 
the 
rakes
and 
scapegraces 
of 
Petersburg.

The 
bottle 
of 
rum 
was 
brought. 
The 
window 
frame 
which 
prevented 
anyone
from 
sitting 
on 
the 
outer 
sill 
was 
being 
forced 
out 
by 
two 
footmen, 
who
were 
evidently 
flurried 
and 
intimidated 
by 
the 
directions 
and 
shouts 
of
the 
gentlemen 
around.

Anatole 
with 
his 
swaggering 
air 
strode 
up 
to 
the 
window. 
He 
wanted<p>
to
smash 
something. 
Pushing 
away 
the 
footmen 
he 
tugged 
at 
the 
frame, 
but
could<p>
not 
move 
it. 
He 
smashed 
a 
pane.

"You 
have 
a 
try, 
Hercules," 
said 
he, 
turning 
to 
Pierre.

Pierre 
seized 
<a href="/aVzUge/lnA2Q68tvrb.html">the</a> 
crossbeam, 
tugged, 
and 
wrenched 
the 
oak 
frame 
out 
with
a 
crash.

"Take 
it 
right 
out, 
or 
they'll 
think 
I'm 
holding 
on," 
said
Dolokhov.

"Is 
the 
Englishman 
bragging?... 
Eh? 
Is 
it 
all 
right?" 
said 
Anatole.

"First-rate," 
said 
Pierre, 
looking 
at 
Dolokhov, 
who 
with 
a 
bottle
of 
rum 
in 
his 
hand 
was 
approaching 
the 
window, 
from 
which 
the 
light 
of
the 
sky, 
the 
dawn 
merging 
with 
the 
afterglow 
of 
sunset, 
was 
visible.

Dolokhov, 
the 
bottle 
of 
rum 
still 
in 
his 
hand, 
jumped 
onto 
the 
window
sill. 
"Listen!" 
cried 
he, 
standing 
there 
and 
addressing 
those 
in 
the
room. 
All 
were 
silent.

"I 
bet 
fifty 
imperials"-he 
spoke 
French 
that 
the 
Englishman 
might
understand 
him, 
but 
he 
did 
not 
speak 
it 
very 
well-"I 
bet 
fifty
imperials 
... 
or 
do 
you 
wish 
to 
make 
it 
a 
hundred?" 
added 
he,
addressing 
the 
Englishman.

"No, 
fifty," 
replied 
the 
latter.

"All 
right.

thanksgiving, 
at 
which
Nicholas 
was 
present, 
was 
held 
in 
the 
cathedral 
for 
the 
Russian 
victory.
He 
stood 
a 
little 
behind 
the 
governor 
and 
held 
himself 
with 
military
decorum 
through 
the 
service, 
meditating 
on 
a 
great 
variety 
of 
subjects.
When 
the 
service 
was 
over 
the 
governor's 
wife 
beckoned 
him 
to 
her.

"Have 
you 
seen 
the 
princess?" 
she 
asked, 
indicating 
with 
a 
movement 
of
her 
head 
a 
lady 
standing 
on 
the 
opposite 
side, 
beyond 
the 
choir.

Nicholas 
immediately 
recognized 
Princess 
Mary 
not 
so 
much 
by 
the 
profile
he 
saw 
under 
her 
bonnet 
as<p>
by 
the 
feeling 
of 
solicitude, 
timidity, 
and
pity 
that 
immediately 
overcame 
him. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EP6vf2J1gcnoA.html">Princess</a> 
Mary, 
evidently 
engrossed
by 
her 
thoughts, 
was 
crossing 
herself 
for 
the 
last 
time 
before 
leaving
the 
church.

Nicholas 
looked 
at 
her 
face 
with 
surprise. 
It 
was 
the 
same 
face 
he 
had
seen 
before, 
there 
was 
the 
same 
general 
expression 
of 
refined, 
inner,
spiritual 
labor, 
but 
now 
it 
was 
quite 
differently 
lit 
up. 
There 
was 
a
pathetic 
expression 
of 
sorrow, 
prayer, 
and 
hope 
in 
it. 
As<p>
had 
occurred
before 
when 
she 
was 
present, 
Nicholas 
went 
up 
to 
her 
without 
waiting 
to
be 
prompted 
by 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/oG7Xiis3zmeD3.html">the</a> 
governor's 
wife 
and 
not 
asking 
himself 
whether 
or 
not
it 
was 
right 
and 
proper 
to 
address 
her 
here 
in 
church, 
and 
told 
her 
he
had 
heard 
of 
her 
trouble 
and 
sympathized 
with 
his 
whole 
soul. 
As 
soon 
as
she 
heard 
his 
voice 
a 
vivid 
glow 
kindled 
in 
her 
face, 
lighting 
up 
both
her 
sorrow 
and 
her 
joy.

"There 
is 
one 
thing 
I 
wanted 
to 
tell 
you, 
Princess," 
said 
Rostov. 
"It
is 
that 
if 
your 
brother, 
Prince 
Andrew 
Nikolaevich, 
were 
not 
living, 
it
would 
have 
been 
at 
once 
announced 
in 
the 
Gazette, 
as 
he 
is<p>
a 
colonel."

The 
princess 
looked 
at 
him, 
not 
grasping 
what 
he 
was 
saying, 
but 
cheered
by 
the 
expression 
of 
regretful 
sympathy 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ak2v5mbEd1ahj.html">his</a> 
face.

"And 
I 
have 
known 
so 
many 
cases 
of 
a 
splinter 
wound" 
(the 
Gazette 
said
it 
was 
a 
shell) 
"either 
proving 
fatal 
at 
once 
or 
being 
very 
slight,"
continued 
Nicholas. 
"We 
must 
hope 
for 
the 
best, 
and 
I 
am 
sure..."

Princess 
Mary 
interrupted 
him.

"Oh, 
that 
would 
be 
so 
dread..." 
she 
began 
and, 
prevented 
by 
agitation
from 
finishing, 
she 
bent 
her 
head 
with 
a 
movement 
as 
graceful 
as
everything 
she 
did 
in 
his 
presence<p>
and, 
looking 
up 
at 
him 
gratefully,
went 
out, 
following 
her 
aunt.

That 
evening 
Nicholas 
did 
not 
go 
out, 
but 
stayed 
at 
home 
to 
settle 
some
accounts 
with 
the 
horse 
dealers. 
When 
he 
had 
finished 
that<p>
business 
it
was 
already 
too 
late 
to 
go<p>
anywhere 
but 
still 
too 
early 
to 
go 
to 
bed,
and 
for 
a 
long 
time 
he 
paced 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room, 
reflecting 
on 
his
life, 
a 
thing 
he 
rarely 
did.

Princess 
Mary 
had 
made 
an 
agreeable 
impression 
on 
him 
when 
he 
had 
met
her 
in 
Smolensk 
province. 
His 
having 
encountered 
her 
in 
such 
exceptional
circumstances, 
and 
his 
mother 
having 
at 
one 
time 
mentioned 
her 
to 
him 
as
a 
good 
match, 
had 
drawn 
his 
particular 
attention 
to 
her. 
When 
he 
met 
her
again 
in 
Voronezh 
the 
impression 
she 
made 
on 
him 
was 
not 
merely 
pleasing
but 
powerful. 
Nicholas 
had 
been 
struck 
by 
the 
peculiar 
moral 
beauty 
he
observed 
in 
her 
at 
this 
time. 
He 
was, 
however, 
preparing 
to 
go 
away 
and
it 
had 
not 
entered 
his 
head 
to 
regret 
that 
he 
was<p>
thus 
depriving 
himself
of 
chances<p>
of 
meeting 
her. 
But 
that 
day's 
encounter 
in

had, 
he
felt, 
sunk 
deeper 
than

CHAPTER 
XVI

Anatole 
had 
lately 
moved 
to 
Dolokhov's. 
The 
plan 
for 
Natalie
Rostova's 
abduction 
had 
been 
arranged 
and 
the 
preparations 
made 
by
Dolokhov 
a 
few 
days 
before, 
and 
on 
the 
day 
that 
Sonya, 
after 
listening
at 
Natasha's 
door, 
resolved 
to 
safeguard 
her, 
it 
was 
to 
have 
been
put 
into 
execution. 
Natasha 
had 
promised 
to 
come 
out 
to 
Kuragin 
at 
the
back 
porch 
at 
ten 
that 
evening. 
Kuragin 
was 
to 
put 
her 
into 
a 
troyka
he 
would 
have 
ready 
and 
to 
drive 
her 
forty 
miles 
to 
the 
village 
of
Kamenka, 
where 
an 
unfrocked 
priest 
was 
in 
readiness 
to 
perform 
a
marriage 
ceremony 
over 
them. 
At 
Kamenka 
a 
relay 
of 
horses 
was 
to 
wait
which 
would 
take 
them 
to 
the 
Warsaw 
highroad, 
and 
from 
there 
they 
would
hasten 
abroad 
with 
post 
horses.

Anatole 
had 
a 
passport, 
an 
order 
for 
post 
horses, 
ten 
thousand 
rubles
he 
had 
taken 
from 
his 
sister 
and 
another 
ten 
thousand 
borrowed 
with
Dolokhov's 
help.

Two 
witnesses 
for 
the 
mock 
marriage-Khvostikov, 
a 
retired 
petty
official 
whom 
Dolokhov 
made 
use 
of 
in 
his 
gambling 
transactions, 
and
Makarin, 
a 
retired 
hussar, 
a 
kindly, 
weak 
fellow 
who 
had 
an 
unbounded
affection 
for 
Kuragin-were 
sitting 
at 
tea 
in 
Dolokhov's 
front
room.

In 
his 
large 
study, 
the 
walls 
of 
which 
were 
hung 
to 
the 
ceiling 
with
Persian 
rugs, 
bearskins, 
and 
weapons, 
sat 
Dolokhov 
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Gw7YmejJ1rRC6eI.html">a</a> 
traveling 
cloak
and 
high 
boots, 
at 
an 
open 
desk 
on 
which 
lay 
an 
abacus 
and 
some 
bundles
of 
paper 
money. 
Anatole, 
with 
uniform 
unbuttoned, 
walked 
to 
and 
fro 
from
the 
room 
where 
the 
witnesses 
were 
sitting, 
through 
the 
study 
to 
the 
room
behind, 
where 
his 
French 
valet 
and 
others 
were 
packing 
the 
last 
of 
his
things. 
Dolokhov 
was 
counting 
the 
money 
and 
noting 
something 
down.

"Well," 
he 
said, 
"Khvostikov 
must 
have 
two 
thousand."

"Give 
it 
to 
him, 
then," 
said 
Anatole.

"Makarka" 
(their 
name 
for 
Makarin) 
"will 
go 
through 
fire 
and
water 
for 
you 
for 
nothing. 
So 
here 
are 
our 
accounts 
all 
settled," 
said
Dolokhov, 
showing 
him 
the 
memorandum. 
"Is 
that 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ro6KqZP8Y6NX.html">right?"

"Yes,</a> 
of 
course," 
returned 
Anatole, 
evidently 
not 
listening 
to
Dolokhov 
and 
looking 
straight 
before 
him 
with 
a 
smile 
that 
did 
not
leave 
his 
face.

Dolokhov 
banged 
down 
the 
lid 
of 
his 
desk 
and 
turned 
to 
Anatole 
with 
an
ironic 
smile:

"Do 
you 
know? 
You'd 
really 
better 
drop 
it 
all. 
There's 
still
time!"

"Fool," 
retorted 
Anatole. 
"Don't 
talk 
nonsense! 
If 
you 
only
knew... 
it's 
the 
devil 
knows 
what!"

"No, 
really, 
give 
it 
up!" 
said 
Dolokhov. 
"I 
am 
speaking
seriously. 
It's 
no 
joke, 
this 
plot 
you've 
hatched."

"What, 
teasing 
again? 
Go 
to 
the 
devil! 
Eh?" 
said<p>
Anatole, 
making 
a
grimace. 
"Really 
it's 
no 
time 
for 
your 
stupid 
jokes," 
and 
he 
left
the 
room.

Dolokhov 
smiled 
contemptuously 
and 
condescendingly 
when 
Anatole 
had
gone 
out.

"You 
wait 
a 
bit," 
he 
called 
after 
him. 
"I'm 
not 
joking, 
I'm
talking 
sense. 
Come 
here, 
come 
here!"

Anatole 
returned 
and 
looked 
at 
Dolokhov, 
trying 
to 
give 
him 
his
attention 
and 
evidently 
submitting 
to 
him 
involuntarily.

"Now 
listen 
to 
me. 
I'm 
telling 
you 
this 
for 
the 
last 
time. 
Why
should 
I 
joke 
about 
it? 
Did 
I 
hinder 
you? 
Who 
arranged 
everything 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iw5i9vWPe0KqZP.html">for

Who 
found 
the 
priest 
and 
got 
the 
passport? 
Who 
raised 
the 
money? 
I
did 
it 
all."

"Well, 
thank 
you 
for<p>
it. 
Do 
you 
think 
I 
am 
not 
grateful?" 
And
Anatole 
sighed 
and 
embraced 
Dolokhov.

"I 
helped 
you, 
but 
all 
the 
same 
I 
must

"Moscow,

Asiatic

of

great 
empire, 
the
 
 
 
 
 
sacred 
city 
of 
Alexander's 
people, 
Moscow 
with 
its
 
 
 
 
 
innumerable 
churches 
shaped 
like 
Chinese 
pagodas."


"Well?" 
asked 
Napoleon.

"One 
of 
Platov's 
Cossacks 
says 
that 
Platov's 
corps 
is 
joining 
up 
with
the 
main 
army 
and 
that 
Kutuzov 
has 
been 
appointed 
commander 
in 
chief. 
He
is 
a 
very 
shrewd 
and 
garrulous 
fellow."

Napoleon 
smiled 
and 
told 
them 
to 
give 
the 
Cossack 
a 
horse 
and 
bring 
the
man 
to 
him. 
He 
wished 
to 
talk 
to 
him 
himself. 
Several 
adjutants 
galloped
off, 
and 
an 
hour 
later, 
Lavrushka, 
the 
serf 
Denisov 
had 
handed 
over
to 
Rostov, 
rode 
up 
to 
Napoleon 
in 
an 
orderly's 
jacket 
and 
on 
a 
French
cavalry 
saddle, 
with 
a 
merry, 
and 
tipsy 
face. 
Napoleon 
told 
him 
to 
ride
by 
his 
side 
and 
began 
questioning 
him.

"You 
are 
a 
Cossack?"

"Yes, 
a 
Cossack, 
your 
Honor."

"The 
Cossack, 
not 
knowing 
in 
what 
company 
he 
was, 
for 
Napoleon's 
plain
appearance 
had 
nothing 
about 
it 
that 
would 
reveal 
to 
an 
Oriental 
mind
the 
presence 
of 
a 
monarch, 
talked 
with 
extreme 
familiarity 
of 
the
incidents 
of 
the 
war," 
says 
Thiers, 
narrating 
this 
episode. 
In
reality 
Lavrushka, 
having 
got 
drunk 
the 
day 
before 
and 
left 
his 
master
dinnerless, 
had 
been 
whipped 
and 
sent 
to 
the 
village 
in 
quest 
of
chickens, 
where 
he 
engaged 
in 
looting 
till 
the 
French 
took 
him 
prisoner.
Lavrushka 
was 
one 
of 
those 
coarse, 
bare-faced 
lackeys 
who 
have 
seen 
all
sorts 
of 
things, 
consider 
it 
necessary 
to 
do 
everything 
in 
a 
mean 
and
cunning 
way, 
are 
ready 
to 
render 
any 
sort 
of 
service 
to 
their 
master,
and 
are 
keen 
at 
guessing 
their 
master's 
baser 
impulses, 
especially 
those
prompted 
by 
vanity 
and 
pettiness.

Finding 
himself 
in 
the 
company 
of 
Napoleon, 
whose 
identity 
he 
had 
easily
and 
surely 
recognized, 
Lavrushka 
was 
not 
in 
the 
least 
abashed 
but 
merely
did 
his 
utmost 
to 
gain 
his 
new 
master's 
favor.

He 
knew 
very 
well 
that 
this 
was 
Napoleon, 
but 
Napoleon's 
presence 
could
no 
more 
intimidate 
him 
than 
Rostov's, 
or 
a 
sergeant 
major's 
with 
the
rods, 
would 
have 
done, 
for 
he 
had 
nothing 
that 
either 
the 
sergeant 
major
or 
Napoleon 
could 
deprive 
him 
of.

So 
he 
rattled 
on, 
telling 
all 
the 
gossip 
he 
had 
heard 
among 
the
orderlies. 
Much 
of 
it 
true. 
But 
when 
Napoleon 
asked 
him 
whether 
the
Russians 
thought 
they 
would 
beat 
Bonaparte 
or 
not, 
Lavrushka 
screwed 
up
his 
eyes 
and 
considered.

In 
this 
question 
he 
saw 
subtle 
cunning, 
as 
men 
of 
his 
type 
<a href="/nocrawl/cZl/PX7zNkID4Gbiq8td.html">see</a> 
cunning
in 
everything, 
so 
he 
frowned 
and 
did 
not 
answer 
immediately.

"It's 
like 
this," 
he 
said 
thoughtfully, 
"if 
there's 
a 
battle 
soon, 
yours
will 
win. 
That's 
right. 
But 
if 
three 
days 
pass, 
then 
after 
that, 
well,
then 
that 
same 
battle 
will 
not 
soon 
be 
over."

Lelorgne 
d'Ideville 
smilingly 
interpreted 
this 
speech 
to 
Napoleon 
thus:
"If 
a 
battle 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
next 
three 
days 
the 
French 
will
win, 
but 
if 
later, 
God 
knows 
what 
will 
happen." 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
smile,
though 
he 
was 
evidently 
in 
high 
good 
humor, 
and 
he 
ordered 
these 
words
to 
be 
repeated.

Lavrushka 
noticed 
this 
and 
to 
entertain 
him 
further, 
pretending 
not 
to
know 
who 
Napoleon 
was, 
added:

"We 
know 
that 
you 
have 
Bonaparte 
and 
that 
he 
has 
beaten 
everybody 
in 
the
world, 
but 
we 
are 
a 
different 
matter..."-without

In

as 
soon 
as

and
her

all 
that 
was 
going

around

and 
felt 
the
necessity 
of 
submitting, 
for 
a 
time, 
to 
this 
new 
order 
of 
things 
which
she 
had 
entered. 
She 
knew 
it 
to 
be 
necessary, 
and 
though 
it 
was 
hard 
for
her 
she 
was 
not 
vexed 
with 
these 
people.

"This 
is 
my 
niece," 
said 
the 
count, 
introducing 
Sonya-"You 
don't 
know
her, 
Princess?"

Princess 
Mary 
turned 
to 
Sonya 
and, 
trying 
to 
stifle 
the 
hostile
feeling 
that 
arose 
in 
her 
toward 
the 
girl, 
she 
kissed 
her. 
But 
she 
felt
oppressed 
by 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
mood 
of 
everyone 
around 
her 
was 
so 
far
from 
what 
was 
in 
her 
own 
heart.

"Where

she 
asked 
again, 
addressing 
them<p>

"He 
is 
downstairs. 
Natasha 
is

answered 
Sonya, 
flushing. 
"We
have 
sent 
to 
ask.<p>
I 
think 
you 
must 
be 
tired, 
Princess."

Tears 
of 
vexation 
showed 
themselves 
in 
Princess 
Mary's 
eyes. 
She 
turned
away 
and 
was 
about 
to 
ask 
the 
countess 
again 
how 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Io4dK9Ujvc.html">go</a> 
to 
him, 
when
light, 
impetuous, 
and 
seemingly 
buoyant 
steps 
were 
heard 
at 
the 
door.
The 
princess 
looked 
round 
and 
saw<p>
Natasha 
coming 
in, 
almost 
running-that
Natasha 
<a href="/cZl/mV9Ook9.html">whom</a> 
she 
had 
liked 
so 
little 
at 
their 
meeting 
in 
Moscow 
long
since.

But 
hardly 
had 
the 
princess 
looked 
at 
Natasha's 
face 
before 
she 
realized
that 
here 
was 
a 
real 
comrade 
in 
her 
grief,<p>
and 
consequently 
a 
friend.
She 
ran 
to 
meet 
her, 
embraced 
her, 
and<p>
began 
to 
cry 
on 
her 
shoulder.

As 
soon 
as 
Natasha, 
sitting 
at 
the 
head 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
bed, 
heard
of 
Princess 
Mary's 
arrival, 
she 
softly 
left 
his 
room 
and 
hastened 
to 
her
with 
those 
swift 
steps 
that 
had 
sounded 
buoyant 
to 
Princess 
Mary.

There 
was 
only 
one 
expression 
on 
her 
agitated 
face 
when 
<a href="/nocrawl/cZl/Ikp85UeLS3HPeSU.html">she</a> 
ran 
into 
the
drawing 
room-that 
of 
love-boundless 
love 
for 
him, 
for 
her, 
and 
for 
all
that 
was 
near 
to 
the 
man 
she 
loved; 
and 
of 
pity, 
suffering 
for 
others,
and 
passionate 
desire 
to 
give 
herself 
entirely 
to 
helping 
them. 
It 
was
plain 
that 
at 
that 
moment 
there 
was 
in 
Natasha's 
heart 
no 
thought 
of
herself 
or 
of 
her 
own 
relations 
with 
Prince 
Andrew.

Princess 
Mary, 
with 
her 
acute 
sensibility, 
understood 
all 
this 
at 
the
first 
glance 
at 
Natasha's 
face, 
and<p>
wept 
on 
her 
shoulder 
with 
sorrowful
pleasure.

"Come, 
come 
to 
him, 
Mary," 
said 
Natasha, 
leading 
her 
into 
the 
other
room.

Princess 
Mary 
raised 
her 
head, 
dried 
her 
eyes, 
and 
turned 
to 
Natasha.
She 
felt 
that 
from 
her 
she 
would 
be 
able 
to 
understand 
and 
learn
everything.

"How..." 
she 
began 
her 
question 
but 
stopped 
short.

She 
felt 
that 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
ask, 
or 
to 
answer, 
in 
words.
Natasha's 
face 
and 
eyes 
would 
have 
to 
tell 
her 
all 
more 
clearly 
and
profoundly.

Natasha 
was 
gazing 
at 
her, 
but 
seemed 
afraid 
and 
in 
doubt 
whether 
to 
say
all 
she 
knew 
or 
not; 
she 
seemed 
to 
feel

trotting 
straight 
toward 
him<p>
and
across 
his 
path. 
Rostov 
put 
his 
horse 
to 
full 
gallop 
to 
get<p>
out 
of 
the
way 
of 
these 
men, 
and 
he 
would 
have 
got 
clear 
had 
they 
continued 
at 
the
same 
speed, 
but 
they 
kept 
increasing 
their 
pace, 
so 
that 
some 
of 
the
horses 
were 
already 
galloping. 
Rostov 
heard 
the 
thud 
of 
their 
hoofs
and 
the 
jingle 
of 
their 
weapons 
and 
saw 
their 
horses, 
their 
figures, 
and
even 
their 
faces, 
more<p>
and 
more 
distinctly. 
They 
were 
our 
Horse 
Guards,
advancing 
to 
attack 
the 
French 
cavalry 
that 
was 
coming 
to 
meet 
them.

The 
Horse 
Guards 
were 
galloping, 
but 
still 
holding 
in 
their 
horses.
Rostov 
could 
already 
see 
their 
faces 
and 
heard 
the 
command:
"Charge!" 
shouted 
by 
an 
officer 
who 
was 
urging 
his 
thoroughbred 
to
full 
speed. 
Rostov, 
fearing 
to 
be 
crushed 
or 
swept 
into 
the 
attack 
on
the 
French,<p>
galloped 
along 
the 
front 
as 
hard 
as 
his 
horse 
could 
go, 
but
still 
was 
not 
in 
time 
to 
avoid 
them.

The 
last 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards, 
a 
huge 
pockmarked 
fellow, 
frowned 
angrily
on 
seeing 
Rostov 
before 
him, 
with 
whom 
he 
would 
inevitably 
collide.
This 
Guardsman 
would 
certainly 
have 
bowled 
Rostov 
and 
his 
Bedouin 
over
(Rostov 
felt 
himself 
quite 
tiny 
and 
weak 
compared 
to 
these 
gigantic 
men
and 
horses) 
had 
it 
not 
occurred 
to 
Rostov 
to 
flourish 
his 
whip 
before
the 
eyes 
of 
the 
Guardsman's 
horse. 
The 
heavy 
black 
horse, 
sixteen
hands 
high, 
shied, 
throwing 
back 
its 
ears; 
but 
the 
pockmarked 
Guardsman
drove 
his 
huge 
spurs 
in 
violently, 
and 
the 
horse, 
flourishing 
its 
tail
and 
extending 
its 
neck, 
galloped 
on 
yet 
faster. 
Hardly 
had 
the 
Horse
Guards 
passed 
Rostov 
before 
he 
heard 
them 
shout, 
"Hurrah!" 
and
looking 
back 
saw 
that 
their 
foremost 
ranks 
were 
mixed 
up 
with 
some
foreign 
cavalry 
with 
red 
epaulets, 
probably 
French. 
He 
could 
see 
nothing
more, 
for 
immediately 
afterwards 
cannon 
began 
firing 
from 
somewhere 
and
smoke 
enveloped 
everything.

At 
that 
moment, 
as 
the 
Horse 
Guards, 
having 
passed 
him, 
disappeared 
in
the 
smoke, 
Rostov 
hesitated 
whether 
to 
gallop 
after 
them 
or 
to 
go<p>
where
he 
was 
sent. 
This 
was 
the 
brilliant 
charge 
of 
the 
Horse 
Guards 
that
amazed 
the 
French 
themselves. 
Rostov 
was 
horrified 
to 
hear 
later 
that
of 
all 
that 
mass 
of 
huge 
and 
handsome 
men, 
of 
all 
those 
brilliant,
rich 
youths, 
officers 
and 
cadets, 
who 
had 
galloped 
past 
him 
on 
their
thousand-ruble 
horses, 
only 
eighteen 
were 
left 
after 
the 
charge.

"Why 
should 
I 
envy 
them? 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/SN3l70yFQ.html">My</a> 
chance 
is 
not 
lost, 
and 
maybe 
I 
shall 
see
the 
Emperor 
immediately!" 
thought 
Rostov 
and 
galloped 
on.

When 
he 
came 
level 
with 
the 
Foot 
Guards 
he 
noticed 
that 
about 
them 
and
around 
them 
cannon 
balls 
were 
flying, 
of 
which 
he 
was 
aware 
not 
so
much 
because 
he 
heard 
their 
sound 
as 
because 
he 
saw 
uneasiness 
on
the 
soldiers' 
faces 
and 
unnatural 
warlike 
solemnity 
on 
those 
of 
the
officers.

Passing 
behind 
one 
of 
the 
lines 
of 
a 
regiment 
of 
Foot 
Guards 
he 
heard 
a
voice 
calling 
him 
by 
name.

"Rostov!"

"What?" 
he 
answered, 
not 
recognizing 
Boris.

"I 
say, 
we've 
been 
in 
the 
front 
line! 
Our 
regiment 
attacked!" 
said
Boris 
with 
the 
happy 
smile 
seen 
on 
the 
faces 
of 
young 
men 
who 
have 
been
under 
fire 
for 
the 
first 
time.

Rostov 
stopped.

"Have 
you?" 
he 
said. 
"Well, 
how 
did 
it 
go?"

"We 
drove 
them 
back!" 
said 
Boris 
with 
animation, 
growing 
talkative.
"Can 
you 
imagine 
it?" 
and 
he 
began 
describing 
how 
the 
Guards, 
having
taken<p>
up 
their 
position 
and 
seeing 
troops 
before 
them, 
thought 
they 
were
Austrians,

asked.

"One 
moment, 
one 
moment!" 
replied 
the 
adjutant, 
and 
riding 
up 
to 
a 
stout
colonel 
who 
was 
standing 
in 
the 
meadow, 
he 
gave 
him 
some 
message 
and
then 
addressed 
Pierre.

"Why 
have 
you 
come 
here, 
Count?" 
he 
asked 
with 
a 
smile. 
"Still
inquisitive?"

"Yes, 
yes," 
assented 
Pierre.

But 
the 
adjutant 
turned 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bF8Ro21viB.html">horse</a> 
about 
and 
rode 
on.

"Here 
it's 
tolerable," 
said 
he, 
"but 
with 
Bagration 
on 
the 
left 
flank
they're 
getting 
it 
frightfully 
hot."

"Really?" 
said 
Pierre. 
"Where 
is 
that?"

"Come 
along 
with 
me 
to 
our 
knoll. 
We 
can 
get 
a 
view<p>
from 
there 
and 
in
our 
battery 
it 
is 
still 
bearable," 
<a href="/aVzUge/vbc998KpkPN.html">said</a> 
the 
adjutant. 
"Will 
you 
come?"

"Yes, 
I'll 
come 
with 
you," 
replied 
Pierre, 
looking 
round 
for 
his 
groom.

It 
was 
only 
now 
that 
he 
noticed 
wounded 
men 
staggering 
along 
or 
being
carried 
on 
stretchers. 
On 
that 
very 
meadow 
he 
had 
ridden 
over 
the 
day
before, 
a 
soldier 
was 
lying 
athwart 
the 
rows 
of 
scented 
hay, 
<a href="/cZl/AC87o7XKBx.html">with</a> 
his
head 
thrown 
awkwardly 
back 
and 
his 
shako 
off.

"Why 
haven't 
they 
carried 
him 
away?" 
Pierre 
was 
about 
to 
ask, 
but 
seeing
the 
stern 
expression 
of 
the 
adjutant 
who 
was 
also 
looking 
that 
way, 
he
checked 
himself.

Pierre 
did 
not 
find 
his 
groom 
and 
rode 
along 
the 
hollow 
with 
the
adjutant 
to 
Raevski's 
Redoubt. 
His 
horse 
lagged 
behind 
the 
adjutant's
and 
jolted 
him 
at 
every 
step.

"You 
don't 
seem 
to 
be 
used 
to 
riding, 
Count?" 
remarked 
the 
adjutant.

"No 
it's 
not 
that, 
but 
her 
action 
seems 
so<p>
jerky," 
said 
Pierre 
in 
a
puzzled 
tone.

"Why... 
she's 
wounded!" 
said 
the 
adjutant. 
"In 
the 
off 
foreleg 
above 
the
knee. 
A 
bullet, 
no 
doubt. 
I 
congratulate 
you, 
Count, 
on 
your 
baptism 
of
fire!"

Having 
ridden 
in 
the 
smoke 
past 
the 
Sixth 
Corps, 
behind 
the 
artillery
which 
had 
been 
moved 
forward 
and 
was 
in 
action, 
deafening 
them 
with 
the
noise 
of 
firing, 
they 
came 
to 
a 
small 
wood. 
There 
it 
was 
cool 
and 
quiet,
with 
a 
scent 
of 
autumn. 
Pierre 
and 
the 
adjutant 
dismounted 
and 
walked 
up
the 
hill 
on 
foot.

"Is 
<a href="/cZl/tE3iLv7to9sVlKw.html">the</a> 
general 
here?" 
asked 
the 
adjutant 
on 
reaching 
the 
knoll.

"He 
was 
here 
a 
minute 
ago 
but 
has 
just 
gone 
that 
way," 
someone 
told 
him,
pointing 
to 
the 
right.

The 
adjutant 
looked 
at 
Pierre 
as 
if 
puzzled 
what 
to 
do 
with 
him 
now.

"Don't 
trouble 
about 
me," 
said 
Pierre. 
"I'll 
go 
up 
onto 
the 
knoll 
if 
I
may?"

"Yes, 
do. 
You'll 
see 
everything 
from 
there 
and 
it's 
less 
dangerous, 
and
I'll 
come 
for 
you."

Pierre 
went<p>
to 
the 
battery 
and 
the 
adjutant 
rode 
on. 
They 
did 
not 
meet
again, 
and 
only 
much 
later 
did 
Pierre 
learn 
that 
he 
lost 
an 
arm 
that
day.

The 
knoll 
to 
which 
Pierre 
ascended 
was 
that 
famous 
one 
afterwards 
known
to 
the 
Russians 
as 
the 
Knoll 
Battery 
or 
Raevski's 
Redoubt,<p>
and 
to 
the
French 
as 
la 
grande 
redoute, 
la 
fatale 
redoute, 
la 
redoute 
du 
centre,
around 
which 
tens 
of 
thousands 
fell, 
and<p>
which 
the 
French 
regarded 
as
the 
key 
to 
the 
whole 
position.

This 
redoubt 
consisted 
of 
a 
knoll, 
on 
three 
sides 
of 
which 
trenches 
had
been 
dug. 
Within 
the 
entrenchment 
stood 
ten 
guns 
that 
were 
being 
fired
through 
openings 
in 
the 
earthwork.

In 
line 
with 
the 
knoll 
on 
both 
sides 
stood 
other 
guns 
which 
also 
fired
incessantly. 
A 
little 
behind 
the 
guns 
stood 
infantry. 
When 
ascending
that 
knoll 
Pierre 
had 
no 
notion 
that 
this 
spot, 
on 
which 
small 
trenches
had 
been 
dug 
and 
from 
which 
a 
few 
guns 
were 
firing, 
was 
the 
most
important 
point 
of 
the 
battle.

On 
the 
contrary, 
just 
because 
he 
happened 
to 
be 
there 
he

He 
understood<p>
his
wife's

"I

This

he

As 
soon 
as 
he 
learned 
that 
the

in 
such 
a

it

"Stop

Pierre 
did 
not

the 
people 
as

but 
saw 
their 
movement.

All 
these 
people 
and 
horses 
seemed 
driven 
forward 
by 
some 
invisible
power. 
During 
the 
hour 
Pierre 
watched 
them 
they 
all 
came 
flowing 
from
the 
different 
streets 
with 
one 
and 
the

desire 
to 
get 
on 
quickly;
they 
all 
jostled 
one 
another, 
began 
to 
grow 
angry 
and 
to 
fight, 
white
teeth 
gleamed, 
brows 
frowned, 
ever 
the

words 
of 
abuse 
flew 
from

all

bore 
the

resolute
and 
coldly 
cruel 
expression 
that 
had 
struck 
Pierre 
that 
morning 
on 
the
corporal's 
face 
when 
the 
drums 
were 
beating.

It 
was 
not 
till 
nearly 
evening 
that 
the 
officer 
commanding 
the 
escort
collected 
his 
men 
and 
with 
shouts 
and<p>
quarrels 
forced 
his 
way 
in 
among
the 
baggage 
trains, 
and 
the 
prisoners, 
hemmed 
in 
on 
all<p>
sides, 
emerged
onto 
the 
Kaluga 
road.

They 
marched 
very 
quickly, 
without 
resting, 
and 
halted 
only 
when 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/hp8Ro6H8Fmd.html">sun
began</a> 
to 
set. 
The 
baggage 
carts 
drew 
up 
close 
together 
and 
the 
men
began 
to 
prepare 
for 
their 
night's 
rest. 
They 
all 
appeared 
angry 
and
dissatisfied. 
For 
a 
long 
time, 
oaths, 
angry 
shouts, 
and 
fighting 
could
be 
heard 
from 
all 
sides. 
A 
carriage 
that 
followed 
the 
escort 
ran
into 
one 
of 
the 
carts 
and 
knocked 
a 
hole 
in 
it 
with 
its 
pole. 
Several
soldiers 
ran 
toward 
the 
cart 
from 
different 
sides: 
some 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vh5UTE21.html">beat</a> 
the
carriage 
horses 
on 
their 
heads, 
turning 
them 
aside, 
others<p>
fought 
among
themselves, 
and 
Pierre 
saw 
that 
one 
German 
was 
badly 
wounded 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Nu5fnBp1NX3.html">the</a> 
head
by 
a 
sword.

It 
seemed 
that 
all 
these 
men, 
now 
that 
they 
had 
stopped 
amid 
fields
in 
the 
chill 
dusk 
of 
the 
autumn 
evening, 
experienced 
one 
and 
the 
same
feeling 
of 
unpleasant 
awakening 
from 
the 
hurry 
and 
eagerness 
to 
push 
on
that 
had 
seized 
them 
at 
the 
start. 
Once 
at 
a 
standstill 
they 
all 
seemed
to 
understand 
that 
they 
did 
not 
yet 
know 
where 
they 
were 
going, 
and 
that
much 
that 
was 
painful 
and 
difficult 
awaited 
them 
on 
this 
journey.

During 
this 
halt 
the

treated 
the

even 
worse 
than 
they

done

It 
was 
here 
that

When

Natasha,

from

her 
dancing

Turning

The

Two

hurriedly

A

shifting

"Say

she
looked 
at

"say

Natasha 
stepped 
back

"Really,

her

still

on 
the

At

with 
soft

the

"Oo-oo,

and 
no
one 
else. 
At 
that 
time 
the 
two 
famous 
decrees 
were 
being 
prepared
that 
so 
agitated 
society-abolishing 
court 
ranks 
and 
introducing
examinations 
to 
qualify 
for 
the 
grades 
of 
Collegiate 
Assessor 
and
State 
Councilor-and 
not 
merely 
these 
but 
a 
whole 
state<p>
constitution,
intended 
to 
change 
the 
existing 
order 
of 
government 
in 
Russia: 
legal,
administrative, 
and 
financial, 
from 
the 
Council 
of 
State 
down 
to 
the
district 
tribunals. 
Now 
those 
vague 
liberal 
dreams 
with 
which 
the
Emperor 
Alexander 
had 
ascended 
the 
throne, 
and 
which 
he 
had 
tried 
to 
put
into 
effect 
with 
the 
aid 
of 
his 
associates, 
Czartoryski, 
Novosiltsev,
Kochubey, 
and 
Strogonov-whom 
he 
himself 
in<p>
jest 
had 
called 
his
Comite 
de 
salut 
public-were 
taking 
shape 
and 
being 
realized.

Now 
all 
these 
men 
were 
replaced 
by 
Speranski 
on 
the 
civil 
side, 
and
Arakcheev 
on 
the 
military. 
Soon 
after 
his 
arrival 
Prince 
Andrew, 
as 
a
gentleman 
of 
the 
chamber, 
presented 
himself 
at 
court 
and 
at 
a 
levee. 
The
Emperor, 
though 
he 
met 
him 
twice, 
did 
not 
favor 
him 
with 
a 
single 
word.
It 
had 
always 
seemed 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
before 
that 
he 
was 
antipathetic
to 
the 
Emperor 
and<p>
that 
the 
latter 
disliked 
his 
face 
and 
personality
generally, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/JU9RPq9tiRgR9b.html">and</a> 
<a href="/cZl/UxO6pSZHI5cLYU2qjYtS.html">in</a> 
the 
cold, 
repellent 
glance 
the 
Emperor 
gave 
him, 
he
now 
found 
further 
confirmation 
of 
this 
surmise. 
The 
courtiers 
explained
the 
Emperor's 
neglect 
of 
him 
by 
His 
Majesty's 
displeasure 
at
Bolkonski's 
not 
having 
served 
since 
1805.

"I 
know 
myself 
that 
one 
cannot 
help 
one's 
sympathies 
and
antipathies," 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"so 
it 
will 
not 
do 
to 
present
my 
proposal<p>
for 
the 
reform 
of 
the 
army

his
father, 
sighing 
and 
evidently</h1>disconcerted, 
very 
soon 
became 
silent 
and
went 
in 
to 
the 
countess. 
In 
all 
his 
encounters 
with 
his 
son, 
the 
count
was 
always<p>
conscious 
of 
his 
own 
guilt 
toward 
him 
for 
having 
wasted 
the
family 
fortune, 
and 
so 
he 
could 
not 
be 
angry 
with 
him 
for 
refusing 
to
marry 
an 
heiress 
and 
choosing 
the 
dowerless 
Sonya. 
On 
this<p>
occasion, 
he
was 
only 
more 
vividly 
conscious 
of 
the 
fact 
that 
if 
his 
affairs 
had 
not
been 
in 
disorder, 
no 
better 
wife 
for 
Nicholas 
than 
Sonya 
could 
have
been 
wished 
for, 
and 
that 
no 
one 
but 
himself 
with 
his 
Mitenka 
and
his 
uncomfortable 
habits 
was 
to 
blame 
for 
the 
condition 
of<p>
the 
family
finances.

The 
father 
and 
mother 
did 
not 
speak 
of 
the 
matter 
to 
their 
son 
again,
but 
a 
few 
days 
later 
the 
countess 
sent 
for 
Sonya 
and, 
with 
a 
cruelty
neither 
of 
them 
expected, 
reproached 
her 
niece 
for 
trying 
to 
catch
Nicholas 
and 
for 
ingratitude. 
Sonya 
listened 
silently 
with 
downcast
eyes 
to 
the 
countess' 
cruel 
words, 
<a href="/nocrawl/cZl/CiG4GFXfk5SN4ioN.html">without</a> 
understanding 
what
was<p>
required 
of 
her. 
She 
was 
ready 
to 
sacrifice 
everything 
for 
her
benefactors. 
Self-sacrifice 
was 
her 
most 
cherished 
idea 
but 
in 
this 
case
she 
could 
not 
see 
what 
she 
ought 
to 
sacrifice, 
or 
for 
whom. 
She 
could
not 
help 
loving 
the 
countess 
and 
the 
whole 
Rostov 
family, 
but 
neither
could 
she 
help 
loving 
Nicholas 
and 
knowing 
that 
his 
happiness 
depended
on 
that 
love. 
She 
was 
silent 
and 
sad 
and 
did 
not 
reply. 
Nicholas 
felt
the 
situation 
to 
be 
intolerable 
and 
went 
to 
have 
an 
explanation 
with 
his
mother. 
He 
first 
implored 
her 
to 
forgive 
him 
and 
Sonya 
and 
consent 
to
their 
marriage, 
then 
he 
threatened 
that 
if 
she 
molested 
Sonya 
he 
would
at 
once 
marry 
her 
secretly.

The 
countess, 
with 
a 
coldness 
her 
son 
had 
never 
seen 
in 
her 
before,
replied 
that 
he 
was 
of 
age, 
that 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
marrying 
without 
his
father's 
consent, 
and 
he 
could 
do 
the 
same,<p>
but 
that 
she 
would 
never
receive 
that 
intriguer 
as 
her 
daughter.

Exploding 
at 
the 
word 
intriguer, 
Nicholas, 
raising 
his 
voice, 
told
his 
mother 
he<p>
had 
never 
expected 
her 
to 
try 
to 
force 
him 
to 
sell 
his
feelings, 
but 
if 
that 
were 
so, 
he 
would 
say 
for 
the 
last 
time.... 
But 
he
had 
no 
time 
to 
utter 
the 
decisive 
word 
which 
the 
expression 
of 
his 
face
caused 
his 
mother 
to 
await 
with 
terror, 
and 
which 
would 
perhaps 
have
forever 
remained 
a 
cruel 
memory 
to 
them 
both. 
He 
had 
not 
time 
to 
say 
it,
for 
Natasha, 
with 
a 
pale 
and 
set 
face, 
entered 
the 
room 
from 
the 
door
at 
which 
she 
had 
been 
listening.

"Nicholas, 
you 
are 
talking 
nonsense! 
Be 
quiet, 
be 
quiet, 
be 
quiet, 
I
tell 
you!..." 
she 
almost 
screamed, 
so 
as 
to 
drown 
his 
voice.

"Mamma 
darling, 
it's 
not 
at 
all 
so... 
my 
poor, 
sweet 
darling," 
she
said 
to 
her 
mother, 
who 
conscious 
that 
they 
had 
been 
on 
the 
brink 
of
a 
rupture 
gazed 
at 
her 
son 
with 
terror, 
but 
in<p>
the 
obstinacy 
and
excitement 
of 
the 
conflict 
could 
not 
and 
would<p>
not 
give 
way.

"Nicholas, 
I'll 
explain 
to 
you. 
Go 
away! 
Listen, 
Mamma 
darling,"
said 
Natasha.

Her 
words 
were 
incoherent, 
but 
they 
attained 
the 
purpose 
at 
which 
she
was 
aiming.

The 
countess, 
sobbing 
heavily, 
hid 
her 
face 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/AS9eaK0z3.html">on</a> 
her 
daughter's 
breast,
while 
Nicholas 
rose, 
clutching<p>
his 
head, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xk9CyE4dcFeE.html">and</a> 
left 
the 
room.

Natasha 
set 
to 
work 
to 
effect 
a 
reconciliation, 
and 
so 
far 
succeeded
that 
Nicholas 
received 
a 
promise 
from 
his 
mother 
that 
Sonya 
should 
not
be 
troubled, 
while 
he<p>
on 
his 
side 
promised 
not 
to 
undertake 
anything
without 
his 
parents' 
knowledge.

Firmly<p>
resolved, 
after 
putting 
his 
affairs 
in 
order 
in 
the 
regiment,
to 
retire 
from 
the 
army 
and 
return 
and 
marry 
Sonya, 
Nicholas, 
serious,
sorrowful, 
and 
at 
variance 
with 
his 
parents, 
but, 
as 
it 
seemed 
to 
him,
passionately 
in 
love, 
left 
at 
the 
beginning<p>
of 
January 
to 
rejoin 
his
regiment.

After 
Nicholas 
had 
gone<p>
things 
in 
the 
Rostov 
household 
were 
more
depressing 
than 
ever, 
and 
the 
countess 
fell 
ill

her

her. 
Strong 
as 
was 
her 
inward<p>
grief, 
this 
wound 
to 
her 
vanity
intensified 
her 
misery.

Once 
she 
came 
to 
her 
mother, 
tried 
to 
say 
something, 
and 
suddenly 
began
to 
cry. 
Her 
tears 
were 
those 
of 
an 
offended 
child 
who 
does 
not 
know 
why
it 
is 
being 
punished.

The 
countess 
began 
to 
soothe 
Natasha, 
<a href="/aVzUge/pD9Vd5AyyZE3wUl.html">who</a> 
after 
first 
listening 
to 
her
mother's 
words, 
suddenly 
interrupted 
her:

"Leave

Her 
voice 
trembled, 
and 
she 
again 
nearly 
cried, 
but 
<a href="/cZl/We5Y7mAz4W.html">recovered</a> 
and 
went
on 
quietly:

"And 
<a href="/aVzUge/Dt5rq4kplH7ioN.html">I</a>

of 
him; 
I
have 
now 
become 
quite 
calm, 
quite 
calm."

The 
day 
after 
this 
conversation 
Natasha 
put 
on 
the 
old 
dress 
which
she 
knew 
had 
the 
peculiar 
property 
of 
conducing<p>
to 
cheerfulness 
in 
the
mornings, 
and 
that 
day 
she 
returned 
to 
the 
old 
way 
of 
life

she 
had
abandoned 
since 
the 
ball. 
Having 
finished 
her 
morning 
tea 
she 
went 
to
the 
ballroom,

she 
particularly 
liked 
for 
its 
loud 
resonance,

singing 
her 
solfeggio.

she 
stood 
still 
in

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk5NDX6.html">room</a> 
and 
sang 
a 
musical 
phrase 
that
particularly 
pleased 
her. 
She 
listened 
joyfully 
(as 
though 
she 
had 
not
expected 
it) 
to 
the 
charm 
of 
the 
notes 
reverberating, 
filling 
the
whole 
empty 
ballroom, 
and 
slowly 
dying 
away; 
and 
all 
at 
once 
she 
felt
cheerful. 
"What's

it?

in

"We

Tell

"Oh,

He

He 
asked

Bolkonski. 
He 
was 
glad 
I

Sonya 
sighed 
sorrowfully.

"But 
you 
haven't 
refused 
Bolkonski?" 
said 
she.

"Perhaps 
I 
have. 
Perhaps 
all 
is 
over 
between 
me 
and 
Bolkonski. 
Why 
do
you

"I

I

"Wait

Sonya,

You'll

what
a

Now

I

But

Sonya 
did 
not 
succumb 
to 
the 
tender 
tone 
Natasha 
used 
toward 
her.
The 
more 
emotional 
and 
ingratiating 
the 
expression 
of 
Natasha's 
face
became, 
the 
more 
serious 
and 
stern 
grew 
Sonya's.

"Natasha," 
said 
she, 
"you 
asked 
me 
not 
to

I
haven't

I

Why 
this 
secrecy?"

"Again,

interrupted 
Natasha.

"Natasha,

"Afraid 
of 
what?"

"I

said 
Sonya 
resolutely,
and 
was 
herself 
horrified 
at 
what 
she 
had 
said.

Anger 
again 
showed 
in 
Natasha's

"And 
I'll

<a href="/aVzUge/Ox4Nec7rqw2XZEHJ.html">And</a> 
Natasha
ran 
out 
of

Natasha 
did 
not 
speak

Sonya 
again

avoided 
her. 
With 
the

she 
went 
about 
the

taking 
up

Near 
the 
altar 
of 
the 
church 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
there 
<a href="/aVzUge/MK2hBn0t8ZVa.html">was</a> 
a 
chapel 
over 
the
tomb 
of 
the 
little 
princess, 
and 
in 
this 
chapel 
was 
a 
marble 
monument
brought 
from 
Italy, 
representing 
an 
angel 
with<p>
outspread 
wings 
ready 
to
fly 
upwards. 
The 
angel's 
upper 
lip 
was 
slightly 
raised 
as 
though
about 
to 
smile, 
and 
once 
on 
coming 
out 
of 
the 
chapel 
Prince 
Andrew 
and
Princess 
Mary 
admitted 
to 
one 
another 
that 
the 
angel's 
face 
reminded
them 
strangely 
of 
the 
little 
princess. 
But 
what 
was 
still 
stranger,
though 
of 
this 
Prince 
Andrew 
said 
nothing 
to 
his 
sister, 
was 
that 
in 
the
expression 
the 
sculptor 
had 
happened 
to 
give 
the 
angel's 
face, 
Prince
Andrew 
read 
the 
same 
mild 
reproach 
he 
had 
read 
on 
the 
face 
of 
his 
dead
wife: 
"Ah, 
why 
have 
you 
done 
this 
to 
me?"

Soon 
after 
Prince 
Andrew's 
return 
the 
old 
prince 
made 
over 
to 
him 
a
large 
estate, 
Bogucharovo, 
about 
twenty-five 
miles 
from 
Bald 
Hills.
Partly 
because 
of 
the 
depressing 
memories 
associated 
with 
Bald 
Hills,
partly 
because 
Prince 
Andrew 
<a href="/aVzUge/GL6CNkX5CS0ugXx.html">did</a> 
not 
always 
feel 
equal 
to 
bearing 
with
his 
father's 
peculiarities, 
and 
partly 
because 
he 
needed 
solitude,
Prince 
Andrew 
made 
use 
of 
Bogucharovo, 
began 
building 
and 
spent 
most 
of
his 
time 
there.

After 
the 
Austerlitz 
campaign 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
firmly 
resolved 
not
to 
continue 
his 
military 
service, 
and 
when 
the 
war 
recommenced
and 
everybody 
had 
to 
serve, 
he 
took 
a 
post 
under 
his 
father 
in 
the
recruitment 
so 
as 
to 
avoid 
active 
service. 
The 
old 
prince 
and 
his 
son
seemed 
to 
have 
changed 
roles 
since 
the 
campaign 
of 
1805. 
The 
old 
man,
roused 
by 
activity, 
expected 
the 
best 
results 
from 
the 
new 
campaign,
while 
Prince 
Andrew 
on 
the 
contrary, 
taking 
no 
part 
in 
the 
war 
and
secretly 
regretting 
this, 
saw 
only 
the 
dark 
side.

On 
February 
26, 
1807, 
the 
old 
prince 
set 
off 
on 
one 
of 
his 
circuits.
Prince 
Andrew 
remained 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
as 
usual 
during 
his 
father's
absence. 
Little 
Nicholas 
had 
been 
unwell 
for 
four 
days. 
The 
coachman 
who
had 
driven 
the 
old 
prince 
to 
town 
returned 
bringing 
papers 
and 
letters
for 
Prince 
Andrew.

Not 
finding 
the 
young 
prince 
in 
his 
study 
the 
valet 
went 
with 
the
letters 
to 
Princess 
Mary's 
apartments, 
but 
did 
not 
find<p>
him 
there. 
He
was 
told 
that 
the 
prince 
had 
gone 
to 
the 
nursery.

"If 
you 
please, 
your 
excellency, 
Petrusha 
has 
brought 
some 
papers,"
said 
one 
of 
the 
nursemaids 
to 
Prince 
Andrew 
who 
was 
sitting 
on 
a
child's 
little 
chair 
while, 
frowning 
and 
with 
trembling 
hands, 
he
poured 
drops 
from 
a 
medicine 
bottle 
into 
a 
wineglass 
half 
full 
of 
water.

"What 
is 
it?" 
he 
said 
crossly, 
and, 
his 
hand 
shaking
unintentionally, 
he 
poured 
too 
many 
drops 
into 
the 
glass. 
He 
threw 
the
mixture 
onto 
the 
floor 
and 
asked 
for 
some 
more 
water. 
The 
maid 
brought
it.

There 
were 
in 
the 
room 
a 
child's 
cot, 
two 
boxes, 
two 
armchairs, 
a
table, 
a 
child's 
table, 
and 
the 
little 
chair 
on 
which 
Prince 
Andrew
was 
sitting. 
The 
curtains 
were 
drawn, 
and 
a 
single 
candle 
was 
burning 
on
the 
table, 
screened 
by 
a 
bound 
music 
book 
so 
that 
the 
light 
did 
not 
fall
on 
the 
cot.

"My 
dear," 
said 
Princess 
Mary, 
addressing 
her 
brother 
from 
beside
the 
cot 
where 
she 
was 
standing, 
"better 
wait 
a 
bit... 
later..."

"Oh, 
leave 
off, 
you 
always 
talk 
nonsense 
and 
keep 
putting 
things
off-and 
this 
is 
what 
comes 
of 
it!" 
said 
Prince 
Andrew 
in 
an
exasperated 
whisper, 
evidently 
meaning 
to 
wound 
his 
sister.

"My 
dear, 
really... 
it's 
better 
not 
to 
wake 
him... 
he's 
asleep,"
said 
the 
princess 
in 
a 
tone 
of 
entreaty.

Prince 
Andrew 
got 
up 
and 
went 
on 
tiptoe 
up 
to 
the 
little 
bed,

in

"That's

countess,

never

he, 
offering 
Nicholas 
a

with 
a 
long 
stem

with 
a 
practiced 
motion 
of 
three 
fingers, 
taking 
down 
another

had 
been 
cut 
short. 
"She's 
ridden 
all

like 
a 
man, 
and 
is 
as
fresh 
as 
ever!"

Soon 
after 
"Uncle's" 
reappearance 
the 
door 
was 
opened, 
evidently
from 
the 
sound 
by 
a 
barefooted 
girl, 
and 
a 
stout, 
rosy, 
good-looking
woman 
of 
about 
forty, 
with 
a 
double 
chin 
and 
full 
red 
lips, 
entered
carrying 
a 
large 
loaded 
tray. 
With 
hospitable 
dignity 
and 
cordiality 
in
her 
glance 
and 
in 
every 
motion, 
she 
looked 
at 
the 
visitors 
and, 
with
a 
pleasant 
smile, 
bowed 
respectfully. 
In 
spite 
of 
her 
exceptional
stoutness, 
which 
caused 
her 
to 
protrude 
her 
chest 
and 
stomach 
and 
throw
back 
her 
head, 
this 
woman 
(who 
was 
"Uncle's" 
housekeeper) 
trod
very 
lightly. 
She 
went 
to 
the 
table, 
set 
down 
the 
tray, 
and 
with 
her
plump 
white 
hands 
deftly 
took 
from 
it 
the 
bottles 
and 
various 
hors
d'oeuvres 
and 
dishes 
and 
arranged 
them 
on 
the 
table. 
When 
she 
had
finished, 
she 
stepped 
aside 
and 
stopped 
at 
the 
door 
with 
a 
smile 
on 
her
face. 
"Here 
I 
am. 
I 
am 
she! 
Now 
do 
you 
understand 
'Uncle'?" 
her
expression 
said 
to 
Rostov. 
How 
could 
one 
help 
understanding? 
Not 
only
Nicholas, 
but 
even 
Natasha<p>
understood 
the 
meaning 
of 
his 
puckered 
brow
and 
the 
happy 
complacent 
smile 
that 
slightly 
puckered 
his 
lips 
when
Anisya 
Fedorovna 
entered. 
On 
the 
tray 
was 
a

As

Pierre's<p>
attention

a 
commotion
going 
on 
at

A 
woman, 
bent 
with

with 
a 
wallet 
on

and 
a 
short, 
long-haired,

in 
a

garment

rushed

up. 
Two 
women 
ran 
out

looking 
round 
at

ran 
in

up 
the

"Those 
are 
Mary's 
'God's

"But

The

that

this:

"Whatever

all<p>
the

the

was 
about 
our 
diplomatic 
relations

Austria 
and
the 
hope 
of 
an

her.

of

like</h1>a 
street 
was 
left 
between 
each 
two 
lines 
of 
troops. 
The
three 
parts 
of 
that 
army 
were 
sharply 
distinguished: 
Kutuzov's
fighting 
army 
(with 
the 
Pavlograds 
on 
the 
right 
flank 
of 
the 
front);
those 
recently 
arrived 
from 
Russia, 
both 
Guards 
and 
regiments 
of 
the
line; 
and 
the 
Austrian 
troops. 
But 
they 
all 
stood 
in 
the 
same 
lines,
under 
one 
command, 
and 
in 
a 
like 
order.

Like 
wind 
over 
leaves 
ran 
an 
excited 
whisper: 
"They're 
coming!
They're 
coming!" 
Alarmed 
voices 
were 
heard, 
and 
a 
stir 
of 
final
preparation 
swept 
over 
all 
the 
troops.

From 
the 
direction 
of 
Olmuetz 
in 
front 
of 
them, 
a 
group 
was 
seen
approaching. 
And 
at 
that 
moment, 
though 
the<p>
day 
was 
still, 
a 
light 
gust
of 
wind 
blowing 
over 
the 
army 
slightly 
stirred 
the 
streamers 
on 
the
lances<p>
and 
the 
unfolded 
standards 
fluttered 
against 
their 
staffs. 
It
looked 
as 
if 
by 
that 
slight 
motion 
the 
army 
itself 
was 
expressing 
its
joy 
at 
the 
approach 
of 
the 
Emperors. 
One 
voice 
was 
heard 
shouting:
"Eyes 
front!" 
Then, 
like 
the 
crowing 
of 
cocks 
at 
sunrise,<p>
this 
was
repeated 
by 
others 
from 
various 
sides 
and 
all 
became 
silent.

In 
the 
deathlike 
stillness 
only 
the 
tramp 
of 
horses 
was 
heard. 
This
was 
the 
Emperors' 
suites. 
The 
Emperors 
rode 
up 
to 
the 
flank, 
and 
the
trumpets 
of 
the 
first 
cavalry 
regiment 
played 
the 
general 
march. 
It
seemed 
as 
though 
not 
the 
trumpeters 
were 
playing, 
but 
as 
if 
the 
army
itself, 
rejoicing 
at 
the 
Emperors' 
approach, 
had 
naturally 
burst 
into
music. 
Amid 
these 
sounds, 
only 
the 
youthful 
kindly 
voice 
of 
the 
Emperor
Alexander 
was 
clearly 
heard. 
He 
gave 
the 
words 
of 
greeting, 
and 
the
first 
regiment 
roared 
"Hurrah!" 
so 
deafeningly, 
continuously, 
and
joyfully 
that 
the 
men 
themselves 
were 
awed 
by 
their 
multitude 
and 
the
immensity 
of 
the 
power 
they 
constituted.

Rostov, 
standing 
in 
the 
front 
lines 
of 
Kutuzov's 
army 
which 
the 
Tsar
approached 
first, 
experienced 
the 
same 
feeling 
as 
every 
other 
man 
in
that 
army: 
a 
feeling 
of 
self-forgetfulness, 
a 
proud 
consciousness 
of
might, 
and 
a 
passionate 
attraction 
to 
him 
who 
was 
the 
cause 
of 
this
triumph.

He 
felt 
that 
at 
a 
single 
word 
from 
that 
man 
all<p>
this 
vast 
mass 
(and 
he
himself 
an 
insignificant 
atom 
in 
it) 
would<p>
go 
through 
fire 
and 
water,
commit 
crime, 
die, 
or 
perform 
deeds 
of 
highest 
heroism, 
and 
so 
he 
could
not 
but 
tremble 
and 
his 
heart 
stand 
still 
at 
the 
imminence 
of 
that 
word.

"Hurrah! 
Hurrah! 
Hurrah!" 
thundered 
from 
all 
sides, 
one 
regiment
after 
another 
greeting 
the 
Tsar 
with 
the 
strains 
of<p>
the 
march, 
and 
then
"Hurrah!"... 
Then 
the 
general 
march, 
and 
again 
"Hurrah! 
Hurrah!"
growing 
ever 
stronger 
and 
fuller 
and 
merging 
into 
a 
deafening 
roar.

Till 
the 
Tsar 
reached 
it, 
each 
regiment 
in 
its 
silence 
and 
immobility
seemed 
like 
a 
lifeless 
body, 
but 
as 
soon 
as 
he 
came 
up 
it<p>
became 
alive,
its 
thunder 
joining 
the 
roar 
of 
the 
whole 
line 
along 
which 
he 
had
already 
passed. 
Through 
the 
terrible 
and 
deafening 
roar 
of 
those 
voices,
amid 
the 
square 
masses 
of 
troops 
standing 
motionless 
as 
if 
turned 
to
stone, 
hundreds 
of 
riders 
composing 
the 
suites 
moved 
carelessly 
but
symmetrically 
and 
above 
all 
freely, 
and 
in 
front 
of 
them 
two 
men-the
Emperors. 
Upon 
them 
the 
undivided, 
tensely 
passionate 
attention 
of 
that
whole 
mass 
of 
men 
was 
concentrated.

The 
handsome 
young 
Emperor 
Alexander, 
in 
the 
uniform 
of 
the 
Horse
Guards, 
wearing 
a

When 
that 
door<p>
was 
opened 
and 
the 
prisoners, 
crowding 
against 
one
another 
like 
a 
flock 
of 
sheep, 
squeezed 
into 
the 
exit, 
Pierre 
pushed
his 
way 
forward 
and 
approached 
that 
very 
captain 
who 
as 
the 
corporal 
had
assured 
him 
was 
ready 
to 
do 
anything 
for 
him. 
The 
captain 
was 
also 
in
marching 
kit, 
and 
on 
his 
cold 
face 
appeared 
that 
same 
it 
which 
Pierre
had 
recognized 
in 
the 
corporal's 
words<p>
and 
in 
the 
roll 
of 
the 
drums.

"Pass 
on, 
pass 
on!" 
the 
captain 
reiterated, 
frowning 
sternly, 
and
looking 
at 
the 
prisoners 
who 
thronged 
past 
him.

Pierre 
went 
up 
to 
him, 
though 
he 
knew 
his 
attempt 
would 
be 
vain.

"What 
now?" 
the 
officer 
asked<p>
with 
a 
cold 
look 
as 
if 
not 
recognizing
Pierre.

Pierre 
told 
him 
about 
the 
sick 
man.

"He'll 
manage 
to 
walk, 
devil 
take 
him!" 
said 
the 
captain. 
"Pass 
on, 
pass
on!" 
he 
continued 
without 
looking 
at 
Pierre.

"But 
he 
is 
dying," 
Pierre 
again 
began.

"Be 
so 
good..." 
shouted 
the 
captain, 
frowning 
angrily.

"Dram-da-da-dam, 
dam-dam..." 
rattled 
the 
drums,<p>
and 
Pierre 
understood
that 
this 
mysterious 
force 
completely 
controlled 
these 
men 
and 
that 
it
was 
now 
useless 
to 
say 
any 
more.

The 
officer 
prisoners<p>
were 
separated 
from 
the 
soldiers 
and 
told 
to 
march
in 
front. 
There 
were 
about 
thirty 
officers, 
with 
Pierre 
among 
them, 
and
about 
three 
hundred 
men.

The 
officers, 
who 
had 
come 
from 
the 
other 
sheds, 
were 
all 
strangers 
to
Pierre 
and 
much 
better 
dressed 
than 
he. 
They 
looked 
at 
him 
and 
at 
his
shoes 
mistrustfully, 
as 
at 
an 
alien. 
Not 
far 
from 
him 
walked 
a 
fat 
major
with 
a 
sallow, 
bloated, 
angry 
face, 
who 
was 
wearing 
a 
Kazan 
dressing
gown 
tied 
round 
with 
a 
towel, 
and 
who 
evidently 
enjoyed 
the 
respect 
of
his 
fellow 
prisoners. 
He 
kept 
one 
hand, 
in 
which 
he 
clasped 
his 
tobacco
pouch, 
inside 
the 
bosom 
of 
his 
dressing 
gown 
and 
held 
the 
stem 
of 
his
pipe 
firmly 
with 
the 
other. 
Panting 
and 
puffing, 
the 
major 
grumbled 
and
growled 
at 
everybody 
because 
he 
thought 
he 
was 
being 
pushed 
and 
that
they 
were 
all 
hurrying 
when 
they 
had 
nowhere 
to 
hurry 
to 
and 
were
all 
surprised 
at 
something 
when 
there 
was 
nothing 
to 
be 
surprised 
at.
Another, 
a 
thin 
little 
officer, 
was 
speaking 
to 
everyone, 
conjecturing
where 
they 
were 
now 
being 
taken 
and 
how 
far 
they 
would 
get 
that 
day. 
An
official 
in 
felt 
boots 
and 
wearing 
a 
commissariat 
uniform 
ran 
round 
from
side 
to 
side 
and 
gazed 
at 
the 
ruins 
of 
Moscow,<p>
loudly 
announcing 
his
observations

to 
what 
had 
been 
burned 
down 
and 
what 
this 
or 
that 
part
of 
the 
city 
was 
that 
they 
could 
see. 
A 
third 
officer, 
who 
by 
his 
accent
was 
a 
Pole, 
disputed 
with 
the 
commissariat 
officer, 
arguing

a 
stir 
in 
the 
ranks 
of 
the 
soldiers 
and 
it 
was 
evident
that 
they 
were 
all 
hurrying-not 
as 
men 
hurry 
to 
do 
something 
they
understand, 
but 
as 
people 
hurry 
to 
finish<p>
a 
necessary 
but 
unpleasant 
and
incomprehensible 
task.

A 
French 
official 
wearing 
a 
scarf 
came 
up 
to 
the 
right 
of 
the 
row 
of
prisoners 
and 
read 
out 
the 
sentence 
in 
Russian 
and 
in 
French.

Then 
two 
pairs 
of 
Frenchmen 
approached 
the 
criminals 
and 
at 
the
officer's 
command 
took 
the 
two 
convicts 
who 
stood 
first 
in 
the 
row. 
The
convicts 
stopped 
when 
they 
reached 
the 
post 
and, 
while 
sacks 
were 
being
brought, 
looked 
dumbly 
around 
as 
a 
wounded 
beast 
looks 
at 
an 
approaching
huntsman. 
One 
crossed 
himself<p>
continually, 
the 
other 
scratched 
his 
back
and 
made 
a 
movement 
of 
the 
lips 
resembling 
a 
smile. 
With 
hurried 
hands
the 
soldiers 
blindfolded 
them, 
drawing 
the 
sacks 
over 
their 
heads, 
and
bound 
them 
to 
the 
post.

Twelve 
sharpshooters 
with 
muskets 
stepped 
out 
of 
the 
ranks 
with 
a 
firm
regular 
tread 
and 
halted 
eight 
paces 
from 
the 
post. 
Pierre 
turned 
away
to 
avoid 
seeing 
what 
was 
going 
to 
happen. 
Suddenly 
a 
crackling, 
rolling
noise 
was 
heard 
which 
seemed 
to 
him 
louder 
than 
the 
most 
terrific
thunder, 
and 
he 
looked 
round. 
There 
was 
some 
smoke, 
and 
the 
Frenchmen
were 
doing<p>
something 
near 
the 
pit, 
with 
pale 
faces 
and 
trembling 
hands.
Two 
more 
prisoners 
were 
led 
up. 
In 
the 
same 
way 
and 
with 
similar 
looks,
these 
two 
glanced 
vainly 
at 
the 
onlookers 
with 
only 
a 
silent 
appeal 
for
protection 
in<p>
their 
eyes, 
evidently 
unable 
to 
understand 
or 
believe
what 
was 
going 
to 
happen 
to 
them. 
They 
could 
not 
believe 
it 
because 
they
alone 
knew 
what 
their 
life 
meant 
to 
them, 
and 
so 
they 
neither 
understood
nor<p>
believed 
that 
it 
could 
be 
taken 
from 
them.

Again 
Pierre 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
look 
and 
again 
turned 
away; 
but 
again 
the
sound 
as 
of 
a 
frightful 
explosion 
struck 
his 
ear, 
and 
at 
the 
same 
moment
he 
saw 
smoke, 
blood, 
and 
the 
pale, 
scared 
faces 
of 
the 
Frenchmen 
who
were 
again 
doing 
something 
by 
the 
post, 
their 
trembling 
hands 
impeding
one 
another. 
Pierre, 
breathing 
heavily, 
looked 
around 
as 
if 
asking 
what
it 
meant. 
The 
same 
question 
was 
expressed 
in 
all<p>
the 
looks 
that 
met 
his.

On 
the 
faces 
of 
all 
the 
Russians 
and 
of 
the 
French 
soldiers 
and 
officers
without 
exception, 
he 
read 
the 
same 
dismay, 
horror, 
and 
conflict 
that
were 
in 
his 
own 
heart. 
"But 
who, 
after 
all, 
is 
doing 
this? 
They 
are 
all
suffering 
as 
I 
am. 
Who 
then 
is 
it? 
Who?" 
flashed 
for 
an 
instant 
through
his 
mind.

"Sharpshooters 
of 
the 
86th, 
forward!" 
shouted 
someone. 
The 
fifth
prisoner, 
the 
one 
next 
to 
Pierre, 
was 
led 
away-alone. 
Pierre 
did 
not
understand 
that 
he 
was 
saved, 
that 
he 
and 
the 
rest 
had 
been 
brought
there 
only 
to 
witness

her 
now 
more 
than

Anatole's

vividly

her 
the 
time
when 
she 
was 
not 
like 
that 
and 
when 
everything 
was 
light 
and 
gay. 
She
sat 
in 
an 
armchair 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/td26W1kQqNG.html">her</a>

jacket

Katie,

turned

for 
the 
third

muttering 
to 
herself.

"I 
told 
you 
it

the 
little 
princess
repeated. 
"I 
should

it's 
not 
my

and 
her 
voice 
quivered 
like 
that 
of 
a 
child 
about 
to 
cry.

The 
old 
prince 
did 
not 
sleep 
either. 
Tikhon, 
half 
asleep, 
heard 
him
pacing 
angrily 
about 
and 
snorting. 
The 
old 
prince 
felt 
as 
though 
he
had 
been 
insulted 
through 
his 
daughter. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EP6vf2J1gcnoA.html">The</a> 
insult 
was 
the 
more 
pointed
because 
it 
concerned 
not 
himself 
but 
another, 
his 
daughter, 
whom 
he
loved 
more 
than 
himself. 
He 
kept 
telling 
himself 
that 
he 
would 
consider
the 
whole 
matter 
and 
decide 
what 
was 
right 
and 
how 
he 
should 
act, 
but
instead 
of 
that<p>
he 
only 
excited 
himself 
more 
and 
more.

"The

The 
old 
prince 
knew 
that 
if 
he 
told 
his 
daughter 
she 
was 
making 
a
mistake 
and 
that 
Anatole 
meant

be 
wounded

would 
be 
gained, 
so 
pacifying 
himself 
with 
this

he 
called 
Tikhon 
and 
began 
to 
undress.

"What

thought 
he,

And 
the 
owner 
of 
the 
manly 
voice, 
evidently 
an 
infantry 
officer,
laughed.

"Yes, 
one 
is 
afraid," 
continued 
the 
first 
speaker, 
he 
of 
the
familiar

"One

Whatever 
we 
may 
say 
about

soul 
going 
to 
the 
sky... 
we 
know 
there 
is
no

but 
only 
an

The 
manly 
voice 
again 
interrupted 
the 
artillery 
officer.

"Well, 
stand 
us 
some 
of 
your

it 
said.

"Why," 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"that's 
the 
captain

stood 
up
in 
the 
sutler's 
hut 
without 
his

He 
recognized 
the 
agreeable,
philosophizing 
voice 
with 
pleasure.

"Some 
herb 
vodka? 
Certainly!" 
said 
Tushin. 
"But 
still, 
to
conceive 
a 
future 
life..."

He 
did 
not 
finish. 
Just 
then 
there 
was 
a 
whistle 
in 
the 
air; 
nearer 
and
nearer, 
faster 
and 
louder, 
louder 
and 
faster, 
a 
cannon 
ball, 
as 
<a href="/cZl/Qc8mJ71Uo.html">if</a>

thudded 
into 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Da5Z0Nec3oRCc.html">the</a> 
ground 
near
the

with 
super 
human

throwing 
up 
a

The

seemed 
to 
groan 
at 
the 
terrible 
impact.

And 
immediately 
Tushin, 
with 
a 
short

in 
the

of

and 
his

rushed 
out 
of 
the

by 
the 
owner 
of

a 
dashing

CHAPTER 
XVII

Mounting 
his 
horse 
again 
Prince 
Andrew 
lingered 
with 
the 
battery,
looking 
at 
the 
puff 
from 
the 
gun 
that 
had 
sent 
the 
ball. 
His 
eyes
ran 
rapidly 
over 
the 
wide 
space, 
but 
he 
only 
saw 
that 
the 
hitherto
motionless 
masses 
of 
the 
French 
now 
swayed 
and 
that 
there 
really 
was
a 
battery 
to 
their 
left. 
The 
smoke 
above 
it 
had 
not 
yet 
dispersed. 
Two
mounted 
Frenchmen, 
probably 
adjutants, 
were 
galloping 
up 
the 
hill. 
<a href="/aVzUge/jS1VWVhi1fvg3.html">A
small</a> 
but 
distinctly 
visible 
enemy 
column 
was 
moving 
down 
the 
hill,
probably 
to 
strengthen 
the 
front 
line. 
The 
smoke 
of 
the 
first 
shot 
had
not 
yet 
dispersed 
before 
another 
puff 
appeared, 
followed 
by 
a 
report.
The 
battle 
had 
begun! 
Prince 
Andrew 
turned 
his 
horse 
and 
galloped 
back
to 
Grunth 
to 
find 
Prince 
Bagration. 
He 
heard 
the 
cannonade 
behind 
him
growing 
louder 
and 
more 
frequent. 
Evidently<p>
our 
guns 
had 
begun 
to 
reply.
From 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
slope, 
where 
the 
parleys 
had 
taken 
place, 
came
the 
report 
of 
musketry.

Lemarrois 
had 
just 
arrived 
at 
a 
gallop 
with 
Bonaparte's 
stern 
letter,
and 
Murat, 
humiliated 
and 
anxious 
to 
expiate 
his 
fault, 
had 
at 
once
moved 
his 
forces 
to 
attack 
the 
center 
and 
outflank<p>
both 
the 
Russian
wings, 
hoping 
before 
evening 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Nz6YyaBP3SEu2IoNM.html">before</a> 
the 
arrival 
of 
the 
Emperor 
to
crush 
the 
contemptible 
detachment 
that 
stood 
before 
him.

"It 
has 
begun. 
Here 
it<p>
is!" 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
feeling 
the
blood 
rush 
to 
his 
heart. 
"But 
where 
and 
how 
will 
my 
Toulon 
present
itself?"

Passing 
between 
the 
companies 
that 
had 
been 
eating 
porridge 
and 
drinking
vodka 
a 
quarter 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZV5hW0bZDWZ8GFXfk.html">of</a> 
an 
hour 
before, 
he 
saw 
everywhere 
the 
same 
rapid
movement 
of 
soldiers 
forming 
ranks 
and 
getting 
their 
muskets 
ready,
and 
on 
all 
their 
faces

said

"Bah,

So

You 
are 
certainly 
brave 
foes. 
The
great 
redoubt

out

pipe!" 
continued 
the 
Frenchman. 
"And
you 
made 
us 
pay 
dear 
for 
it. 
I 
was 
at 
it 
three 
times-sure 
as 
I 
sit 
here.
Three 
times 
we 
reached 
the 
guns 
and 
three 
times 
we 
were 
thrown 
back
like 
cardboard 
figures. 
Oh, 
it 
was 
beautiful, 
Monsieur 
Pierre! 
Your
grenadiers 
were 
splendid, 
by 
heaven! 
I 
saw 
them 
close 
up 
their 
ranks 
six
times 
in 
succession 
and 
march 
as 
if 
on 
parade. 
Fine 
fellows! 
Our 
King 
of
Naples, 
who 
knows 
what's 
what, 
cried 
'Bravo!' 
Ha, 
ha! 
So 
you 
are 
one 
of
us 
soldiers!" 
he 
added, 
smiling, 
after 
a 
momentary 
pause. 
"So 
much
the 
better, 
so 
much 
the 
better, 
Monsieur 
Pierre!<p>
Terrible 
in 
battle...
gallant... 
with 
the 
fair" 
(he 
winked 
and 
smiled), 
"that's 
what 
the
French 
are, 
Monsieur 
Pierre, 
aren't 
they?"

The 
captain 
was 
so 
naively 
and 
good-humoredly 
gay, 
so 
real, 
and 
so
pleased 
with 
himself 
that 
Pierre 
almost 
winked 
back 
as 
he 
looked 
merrily
at 
him. 
Probably 
the 
word 
"gallant" 
turned 
the 
captain's 
thoughts<p>
to 
the
state 
of 
Moscow.

"Apropos, 
tell 
me 
please, 
is 
it 
true 
that 
the 
women 
have 
all 
left
Moscow? 
What 
a 
queer 
idea! 
What 
had 
they 
to 
be 
afraid 
of?"

"Would 
not 
the 
French 
<a href="/cZl/UDh6AF00.html">ladies</a> 
leave 
Paris 
if 
the 
Russians 
entered 
it?"
asked 
Pierre.

"Ha, 
ha, 
ha!" 
The 
Frenchman 
emitted 
a 
merry, 
sanguine 
chuckle, 
patting
Pierre 
on 
the 
shoulder. 
"What 
a 
thing 
to 
say!" 
he 
exclaimed. 
"Paris?...
But 
Paris, 
Paris..."

"Paris-the 
capital 
of 
the 
world," 
Pierre 
finished 
his 
remark 
for 
him.

The 
captain 
looked 
at 
Pierre. 
He 
had 
a 
habit 
of 
stopping 
short 
in 
the
middle 
of 
his 
talk 
and 
gazing 
intently 
with 
his 
laughing, 
kindly 
eyes.

"Well, 
if 
you 
hadn't 
told 
me 
you 
were 
Russian, 
I 
should 
have 
wagered
that 
you 
were 
Parisian! 
You 
have 
that... 
I 
don't 
know 
what, 
that..." 
and
having 
uttered 
this 
compliment, 
he 
again 
gazed 
at 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cm8wNlRn9CpNdk5.html">him</a> 
in 
silence.

"I 
have 
been 
in 
Paris. 
I 
spent 
years 
there," 
said 
Pierre.

"Oh 
yes, 
one 
sees 
that 
plainly. 
Paris!... 
A 
man 
who 
doesn't 
know 
Paris
is 
a 
savage. 
You 
can 
tell 
a 
Parisian 
two 
leagues 
off. 
Paris 
is 
Talma, 
la
Duchenois, 
Potier, 
the 
Sorbonne, 
the 
boulevards," 
and 
noticing 
that
his 
conclusion 
was 
weaker 
than 
what 
had 
gone 
before, 
he 
added<p>
quickly:
"There 
is 
only 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jT2bI3yxat5tLBOA.html">one</a> 
Paris 
in 
the 
world. 
You 
have 
been 
to 
Paris 
and 
have
remained 
Russian. 
Well, 
I 
don't 
esteem 
you 
the 
less 
for 
it."

Under 
the 
influence 
of 
the 
wine 
he 
had 
drunk, 
and 
after 
the 
days 
he 
had
spent 
alone 
with 
his 
depressing 
thoughts, 
Pierre 
involuntarily 
enjoyed
talking 
with 
this 
cheerful 
and 
good-natured 
man.

"To 
return 
to 
your 
ladies-I 
hear 
they 
are 
lovely. 
What 
a 
wretched 
idea
to 
go 
and 
bury 
themselves 
in 
the 
steppes 
when 
the 
French 
army 
is 
in
Moscow.

he 
began, 
but 
Pierre 
interrupted 
him.

"The

Pierre 
repeated, 
and 
his 
face 
suddenly 
became

CHAPTER 
XXII

While 
these 
conversations 
were 
going 
on 
in 
the 
reception 
room 
and 
the
princess' 
room, 
a 
carriage 
containing 
Pierre 
(who 
had 
been 
sent 
for)
and 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
(who 
found 
it 
necessary 
to 
accompany 
him) 
was
driving 
into 
the 
court 
of 
Count 
Bezukhov's 
house. 
As 
the 
wheels
rolled 
softly 
over 
the 
straw 
beneath 
the 
windows, 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna,
having 
turned 
with 
words 
of 
comfort 
to 
her 
companion, 
realized 
that
he 
was 
asleep 
in 
his 
corner 
and 
woke 
him 
up. 
Rousing 
himself, 
Pierre
followed 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
out 
of 
the 
carriage, 
and 
only 
then 
began
to 
think 
of 
the 
interview 
with 
his 
dying 
father 
which 
awaited 
him. 
He
noticed 
that 
they 
had 
not 
come 
to 
the 
front 
entrance 
but 
to 
<a href="/aVzUge/hfW2t0f7UKBi.html">the</a> 
back
door. 
While 
he 
was 
getting 
down 
from 
the 
carriage 
steps 
two 
men, 
who
looked 
like 
tradespeople, 
ran 
hurriedly 
from 
the 
entrance 
and 
hid 
in 
the
shadow 
of 
the 
wall. 
Pausing 
for 
a 
moment, 
Pierre 
noticed 
several 
other
men 
of 
the 
same 
kind 
hiding 
in 
the 
shadow 
of 
the 
house 
on 
both 
sides.
But 
neither 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
nor 
the 
footman 
nor 
the 
coachman, 
who
could 
not 
help 
seeing 
these 
people, 
took 
any 
notice 
of 
them. 
"It 
seems
to 
be 
all 
right," 
Pierre 
concluded, 
and 
followed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/me60s7mrwmb.html">Anna</a> 
Mikhaylovna.
She 
hurriedly 
ascended 
the 
narrow 
dimly 
lit 
stone 
staircase, 
calling 
to
Pierre, 
who 
was 
lagging 
behind, 
to 
follow. 
Though 
he 
<a href="/cZl/hU7NY4DduKC0zvJ.html">did</a> 
not 
see 
why 
it
was 
necessary 
for 
him 
to 
go 
to 
the 
count 
at 
all, 
still 
less 
why 
he 
had
to 
go 
by 
the 
back 
stairs, 
yet 
judging 
by 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna's 
air
of 
assurance 
and 
haste, 
Pierre 
concluded 
that 
it 
was 
all 
absolutely
necessary. 
Halfway 
up 
the<p>
stairs 
they 
were 
almost 
knocked 
over 
by
some 
<a href="/aVzUge/mK9b97YIp.html">men</a> 
who, 
carrying 
pails, 
came 
running 
downstairs, 
their 
boots
clattering. 
These 
men 
pressed 
close 
to 
the 
wall 
to 
let 
Pierre 
and 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
pass 
and 
did 
not 
evince 
the 
least 
surprise 
at 
seeing 
them
there.

"Is 
this 
the 
way 
to 
the 
princesses' 
apartments?" 
asked 
Anna
Mikhaylovna 
of 
one 
of 
them.

"Yes," 
replied 
a 
footman 
in 
a 
bold 
loud 
voice, 
as 
if 
anything 
were
now 
permissible; 
"the 
door 
to 
the 
left, 
ma'am."

"Perhaps 
the 
count 
did 
not 
ask 
<a href="/cZl/ml75ReoD3VEt.html">for</a> 
me," 
said 
Pierre 
when 
he 
reached
the 
landing. 
"I'd 
better 
go 
to 
my 
own 
room."

Anna 
Mikhaylovna<p>
paused 
and 
waited 
for 
him 
to 
come 
up.

"Ah, 
my 
friend!" 
she 
said, 
touching 
his 
arm 
as 
she 
had 
done 
her
son's 
when 
speaking 
to 
him 
that 
afternoon, 
"believe 
me 
I 
suffer 
no
less 
than 
you 
do, 
but 
be 
a 
man!"

"But 
really,<p>
hadn't 
I 
better 
go 
away?" 
he 
asked,<p>
looking 
kindly 
at
her 
over 
his 
spectacles.

"Ah, 
my 
dear 
friend! 
Forget 
the 
wrongs 
that 
may 
have 
been 
done 
you.
Think 
that 
he 
is 
your 
father 
... 
perhaps 
in 
the 
agony 
of 
death." 
She
sighed. 
"I 
have 
loved 
you 
like 
a 
son 
from 
the 
first. 
Trust 
yourself 
to
me, 
Pierre. 
I 
shall 
not 
forget 
your 
interests."

Pierre 
did 
not 
understand 
a 
word, 
but 
the 
conviction 
that 
all 
this 
had
to 
be 
grew 
stronger, 
and 
he 
meekly 
followed 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
who 
was
already 
opening 
a 
door.

This 
door 
led 
into 
a 
back 
anteroom. 
An 
old 
man, 
a 
servant 
of 
the
princesses, 
sat 
in 
a 
corner 
knitting 
a 
stocking. 
Pierre 
had 
never 
been
in 
this 
part 
of 
the 
house 
and 
did 
not 
even 
know 
of 
the 
existence 
of
these 
rooms.

flew
furiously 
up,

then 
all

an 
approaching 
sleigh
in 
which 
the 
figures 
of 
the 
Emperor 
and 
Volkonski 
could 
already 
be
descried.

From 
the 
habit 
of 
fifty 
years 
all 
this

on 
the

the

having 
alighted 
from 
the 
sleigh,
lifted 
his 
eyes 
to 
him, 
handed 
him 
the 
report 
and 
began 
speaking 
in 
his
smooth, 
ingratiating 
voice.

The 
Emperor 
with 
a 
rapid 
glance 
scanned 
Kutuzov 
from 
head 
to 
foot,
frowned 
for 
an 
instant, 
but 
immediately 
mastering 
himself 
went 
up 
to 
the

extended

this

Their

however, 
not

only 
changed

The

the<p>

against

Tushin's 
companion 
officer
had 
been 
killed 
at 
the 
beginning 
of

engagement

Twice 
they

French

below

they 
fired 
grapeshot

Tushin,

feebly

awkwardly, 
kept 
telling 
his 
orderly 
to
"refill

pipe

and 
then,

sparks

forward 
shading

his 
small 
hand

French.

"Smack

he 
kept 
saying, 
seizing 
the 
guns 
by 
the
wheels 
and 
working 
the 
screws 
himself.

Amid 
the 
smoke,

the 
incessant

made 
him

Tushin 
not

put

down 
in

corner, 
and 
folding 
his

placed 
himself 
before 
the 
icon.
Softened 
by 
memories 
of 
Princess 
Mary 
he 
began 
to 
pray 
as 
he 
had 
not
done 
for 
a 
long 
time. 
Tears 
were 
in 
his 
eyes 
and 
in 
his 
throat 
when 
the
door 
opened 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/Cm8wNlRn9CpNdk5.html">Lavrushka</a> 
came 
in 
with 
some 
papers.

"Blockhead! 
Why 
do 
you 
come 
in 
without 
being 
called?" 
cried 
Nicholas,
quickly 
changing 
his 
attitude.

"From 
the 
governor," 
said 
Lavrushka 
in 
a 
sleepy 
voice. 
"A 
courier 
has
arrived 
and 
there's 
a 
letter 
for 
you."

"Well, 
all 
right, 
thanks. 
You 
can 
go!"

Nicholas 
took 
the 
two 
letters, 
one 
of 
which 
was 
from 
his 
mother 
and
the 
other 
from 
Sonya.<p>
He 
recognized 
them 
by 
the 
handwriting 
and 
opened
Sonya's<p>
first. 
He 
had 
read 
only 
a 
few<p>
lines 
when 
he 
turned 
pale 
and<p>
his
eyes 
opened 
wide 
with 
fear 
and 
joy.

"No, 
it's 
not 
possible!" 
he 
cried 
aloud.

Unable 
to 
sit 
still 
he 
paced 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room 
holding 
the 
letter 
and
reading 
it. 
He 
glanced 
<a href="/aVzUge/Oy5GCnw4J1.html">through</a> 
it, 
then 
read 
it 
again, 
and 
then 
again,
and 
standing 
still 
in 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
room 
he 
raised 
his 
shoulders,
stretching 
out 
his 
hands, 
with 
his 
mouth 
wide 
open 
and 
his 
eyes 
fixed.
What 
he 
had 
just 
been 
praying 
for 
with 
confidence 
that 
God 
would 
hear
him 
had 
come 
to 
pass; 
but 
Nicholas 
was 
as 
much 
astonished 
as 
if 
it 
were
something 
extraordinary 
and 
unexpected, 
and 
as 
if 
the 
very 
fact 
that 
it
had 
happened 
so 
quickly 
proved 
that 
it 
had 
not 
come 
from 
God 
to 
whom 
he
had 
prayed, 
but 
by 
some 
ordinary 
coincidence.

"Back!"

was

The

Nastasya 
Ivanovna 
dismounted

it 
up. 
The

the

The

saw

Mitka 
staring 
at 
him 
with 
eyes
starting 
out

The 
generals 
bowed 
and 
retired. 
It 
was 
past
midnight. 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
out.

The 
council 
of 
war, 
at 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
not 
been 
able 
to
express 
his 
opinion 
as 
he 
had 
hoped 
to, 
left 
on 
him 
a 
vague 
and 
uneasy
impression. 
Whether 
Dolgorukov 
and 
Weyrother, 
or 
Kutuzov, 
Langeron,
and 
the 
others 
who 
did 
not 
approve 
of 
the 
plan 
of 
attack, 
were
right-he 
did 
not 
know. 
"But 
was 
it 
really 
not 
possible 
for 
Kutuzov
to 
state 
his 
views 
plainly 
to 
the 
Emperor? 
Is 
it<p>
possible 
that 
on
account 
of 
court 
and 
personal 
considerations 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
lives,
and 
my 
life, 
my 
life," 
he 
thought, 
"must 
be 
risked?"

"Yes, 
it 
is 
very 
likely 
that 
I 
shall 
be 
killed 
tomorrow," 
he
thought. 
And 
suddenly, 
at 
this 
thought 
of 
death, 
a 
whole 
series 
of 
most
distant, 
most 
intimate, 
memories 
rose 
in 
his 
imagination: 
he 
remembered
his 
last 
parting 
from 
his 
father 
and 
his 
wife; 
he 
remembered 
the 
days
when 
he 
first 
loved 
her. 
He 
thought 
of 
her 
pregnancy 
and 
felt 
sorry 
for
her 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/xk9CyE4dcFeE.html">for</a> 
himself, 
and 
in 
a 
nervously 
emotional 
and 
softened 
mood 
he
went 
out 
of 
the 
hut 
in 
which 
he 
was 
billeted 
with 
Nesvitski 
and 
began
to 
walk 
up 
and 
down 
before 
it.

The 
night 
was 
foggy 
and 
through 
the 
fog 
the 
moonlight 
gleamed
mysteriously. 
"Yes, 
tomorrow, 
tomorrow!" 
he 
thought. 
"Tomorrow
everything 
may 
be 
over 
for 
me! 
All 
these 
memories 
will 
be 
no 
more, 
none
of 
them 
will 
have 
any 
meaning 
for 
me. 
Tomorrow 
perhaps, 
even 
certainly,
I 
have 
a 
presentiment 
that 
for 
the 
first 
time 
I 
shall 
have 
to 
show 
all
I 
can 
do." 
And 
his 
fancy 
pictured 
the 
battle, 
its 
loss, 
the
concentration 
of 
fighting 
at 
one 
point, 
and 
the 
hesitation 
of 
all 
the
commanders. 
And 
then 
that 
happy 
moment, 
that 
Toulon 
for 
which 
he 
had
so 
long 
waited, 
presents 
itself 
to 
him 
at 
last. 
He 
firmly 
and 
clearly
expresses 
his 
opinion 
to 
Kutuzov, 
to 
Weyrother, 
and 
to 
the 
Emperors.
All 
are 
struck 
by 
the 
justness 
of 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/mRO2tA4xLYdP0.html">his</a> 
views, 
but 
no 
one 
undertakes 
to
carry 
them 
out, 
so 
he 
takes 
a 
regiment, 
a 
division-stipulates 
that 
no
one 
is 
to 
interfere 
with 
his 
arrangements-leads 
his 
division 
to
the 
decisive 
point, 
and 
gains 
the 
victory 
alone. 
"But 
death 
and
suffering?" 
suggested 
another 
voice. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
however, 
did 
not
answer 
that 
voice 
and 
went 
on 
dreaming 
of 
his 
triumphs. 
The 
dispositions
for 
the 
next 
battle 
are 
planned 
by 
him 
alone. 
Nominally 
he 
is 
only 
an
adjutant 
on 
Kutuzov's 
staff, 
but 
he 
does 
everything 
alone. 
The 
next
battle 
is 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Yv7tA1IgdEd9UybKc.html">won</a>

him 
alone. 
Kutuzov

asked 
the

"If

Prince

answered 
himself,

tears 
gushed 
from 
her 
eyes, 
and 
she 
turned 
quickly 
to
hide 
them 
and 
left 
the 
room.

She 
passed 
into 
the 
sitting 
room, 
stood 
there 
thinking 
awhile, 
and 
then
went 
into 
the 
maids' 
room. 
There 
an 
old 
maidservant 
was 
grumbling 
at
a 
young 
girl 
who 
stood 
panting, 
having 
just 
run 
in 
through 
the 
cold 
from
the 
serfs' 
quarters.

"Stop 
playing-there's 
a 
time 
for 
everything," 
said 
the 
old
woman.

"Let 
her 
alone, 
Kondratevna," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Go, 
Mavrushka,
go."

Having 
released 
Mavrushka, 
Natasha 
crossed 
the 
dancing 
hall 
and 
went
to 
the 
vestibule. 
There 
an 
old 
footman 
and 
two 
young 
ones 
were 
playing
cards. 
They 
broke 
off 
and 
rose 
as 
she 
entered.

"What 
can 
I 
do 
with 
them?" 
thought 
Natasha.

"Oh, 
Nikita, 
please 
go... 
where 
can 
I 
send 
him?... 
Yes, 
go 
to 
the
yard 
and 
fetch 
a 
fowl, 
please, 
a 
cock, 
and 
you, 
Misha, 
bring 
me 
some
oats."

"Just 
a 
few 
oats?" 
said 
Misha, 
cheerfully 
and 
readily.

"Go, 
go 
quickly," 
the 
old 
man 
urged 
him.

"And 
you, 
Theodore, 
get 
me 
a 
piece 
of 
chalk."

On 
her 
way 
past 
the 
butler's 
pantry 
she 
told 
them 
to 
set 
a 
samovar,
though 
it 
was 
not 
at 
all 
the 
time 
for 
tea.

Foka, 
the 
butler, 
was 
the 
most 
ill-tempered 
person 
in 
the 
house.
Natasha 
liked 
to 
test 
her 
power 
over 
him. 
He 
distrusted 
the 
order 
and
asked 
whether 
the 
samovar 
was 
really 
wanted.

"Oh 
dear, 
what 
a 
young 
lady!" 
said 
Foka, 
pretending 
to 
frown 
at
Natasha.

No 
one 
in 
the 
house 
sent 
people 
about 
or 
gave 
them 
as 
much 
trouble 
as
Natasha 
did. 
She 
could 
not 
see 
people 
unconcernedly, 
but 
had 
to 
send
them 
on 
some 
errand. 
She 
seemed 
to 
be 
trying 
whether 
any 
of 
them 
would
get 
angry 
or 
sulky 
with 
her; 
but 
the 
serfs 
fulfilled 
no 
one's 
orders
so 
readily 
as 
they 
did 
hers. 
"What 
can 
I 
do, 
where 
can 
I 
go?"
thought 
she, 
as 
she 
went 
slowly 
along 
the 
passage.

"Nastasya 
Ivanovna, 
what 
sort 
of 
children 
shall 
I 
have?" 
she 
asked
the 
buffoon, 
who 
was 
coming 
toward 
her 
in 
a 
woman's<p>
jacket.

"Why, 
fleas, 
crickets, 
grasshoppers," 
answered 
the 
buffoon.

"O<p>
Lord, 
O 
Lord, 
it's 
always 
the 
same! 
Oh, 
where 
am 
I 
to 
go? 
What
am 
I 
to 
do 
with 
myself?" 
And 
tapping 
with 
her 
heels, 
she 
ran 
quickly
upstairs 
to 
see 
Vogel 
and 
his<p>
wife 
who 
lived 
on 
the 
upper 
story.

Two 
governesses 
were 
sitting 
with 
the 
Vogels 
at 
a 
table, 
on 
which<p>
were
plates 
of 
raisins, 
walnuts, 
and 
almonds. 
The 
governesses 
were 
discussing
whether 
it 
was 
cheaper 
to 
live 
in 
Moscow<p>
or 
Odessa. 
Natasha 
sat 
down,
listened 
to 
their 
talk 
with 
a 
serious 
and 
thoughtful 
air, 
and 
then 
got
up 
again.

"The 
island 
of 
Madagascar," 
she 
said, 
"Ma-da-gas-car," 
she
repeated, 
articulating 
each 
syllable 
distinctly, 
and, 
not 
replying 
to
Madame 
Schoss 
who 
asked 
her 
what 
she 
was 
saying, 
she 
went 
out 
of 
the
room.

Her 
brother 
Petya 
was 
upstairs 
too; 
with 
the 
man 
in 
attendance 
on 
him
he 
was 
preparing 
fireworks 
to 
let 
off 
that 
night.

"Petya! 
Petya!" 
she 
called 
to 
him. 
"Carry 
me 
downstairs."

Petya 
ran 
up 
and 
offered 
her 
his 
back. 
She 
jumped 
on 
it, 
putting 
her
arms 
round 
his 
neck,

were 
in 
his 
place..."

By 
association 
of 
ideas, 
Pierre 
was 
at 
once 
carried 
back 
to 
the 
day
when, 
trying 
to 
comfort 
her, 
he 
had 
said 
that 
if 
he 
were 
not 
himself<p>
but
the 
best 
man 
in 
the 
world 
and 
free, 
he 
would 
ask 
on 
his 
knees 
for 
her
hand; 
and 
the 
same 
feeling 
of 
pity, 
tenderness, 
and 
love 
took 
possession
of 
him 
and 
the 
same 
words 
rose 
to 
his 
lips. 
But 
she 
did 
not 
give 
him
time 
to 
say 
them.

"Yes, 
you... 
you..." 
she 
said, 
uttering 
the 
word 
you 
rapturously-"that's
a 
<a href="/cZl/qB3Qc20fU.html">different</a> 
thing. 
I 
know 
no 
one 
kinder, 
more 
generous, 
or 
better 
than
you; 
nobody 
could 
be! 
Had 
you 
<a href="/cZl/qK5mM4pXQvm.html">not</a> 
been 
there 
then, 
and 
now 
too, 
I 
don't
know 
what 
would 
have 
<a href="/aVzUge/tL5Uijd5rqw1xgX.html">become</a> 
of 
me, 
because..."

Tears 
suddenly 
rose 
in 
her 
eyes, 
she 
turned 
away, 
lifted 
her 
music
before 
her 
eyes, 
began 
singing 
again, 
and 
again 
began 
walking 
up 
and
down 
the 
room.

Just 
then 
Petya 
came 
running 
in 
from 
the 
drawing 
room.

Petya 
was 
now 
a 
handsome 
rosy 
lad 
of 
fifteen 
with 
full 
red 
lips 
and
resembled 
Natasha. 
He 
was 
preparing 
to 
enter 
the 
university, 
but 
he 
and
his 
friend 
Obolenski 
had 
lately, 
in 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dd9XZEHJ3g8CKMN.html">secret,</a> 
agreed 
to 
join 
the 
hussars.

Petya 
had 
come 
rushing 
out 
to 
talk 
to 
his 
namesake 
about 
this 
affair.
He 
had 
asked 
Pierre 
to 
find 
out 
whether 
he 
would 
be 
accepted 
in 
the
hussars.

Pierre 
walked 
up 
and 
down 
the 
drawing 
room, 
not 
listening 
to 
what 
Petya
was 
saying.

Petya 
pulled 
him 
by 
the 
arm 
to 
attract 
his 
attention.

"Well, 
what 
about 
my 
plan? 
Peter 
Kirilych, 
for 
heaven's 
sake! 
You 
are 
my
only 
hope," 
said 
Petya.

"Oh 
yes, 
your 
plan. 
To 
join 
the 
hussars? 
I'll 
mention 
it, 
I'll 
bring 
it
all 
up 
today."

"Well, 
mon 
cher, 
have 
you 
got 
the 
manifesto?" 
asked 
the 
old 
count. 
"The
countess 
has 
been 
to 
Mass 
at 
the 
Razumovskis' 
and 
heard 
the 
new 
prayer.
She 
says 
it's 
very 
fine."

"Yes, 
I've 
got 
it," 
said 
Pierre. 
"The 
Emperor 
is 
to 
be 
here 
tomorrow...
there's 
<a href="/aVzUge/mo93yxsz3GBhrH.html">to</a> 
be 
an 
Extraordinary 
Meeting 
of 
the 
nobility, 
and 
they 
are
talking 
of 
a 
levy 
of 
ten 
men 
per 
thousand. 
Oh 
yes, 
let 
me 
congratulate
you!"

"Yes, 
yes, 
thank 
God! 
Well, 
and 
what 
news 
from 
the 
army?"

"We 
are 
again 
retreating. 
They 
say 
we're 
already 
near 
Smolensk," 
replied
Pierre.

"O 
Lord, 
O 
Lord!" 
exclaimed 
the 
count. 
"Where 
is 
the 
manifesto?"

"The 
Emperor's 
appeal? 
Oh 
yes!"

Pierre 
began 
feeling 
in 
his 
pockets<p>
for 
the 
papers, 
but 
could 
not 
find
them. 
Still 
slapping 
his 
pockets, 
he 
kissed 
the 
hand 
of 
the 
countess
who 
entered 
the 
room 
and 
glanced 
uneasily 
around, 
evidently 
expecting
Natasha, 
who 
had 
left 
off 
singing 
but 
had 
not 
yet 
come 
into 
the 
drawing
room.

"On 
my 
word, 
I 
don't 
know 
what 
I've 
done 
with 
it," 
he 
said.

A 
third

scattered 
through 
the

arranging 
quarters 
for 
the 
staff
officers, 
carrying 
out 
the 
French 
corpses 
that 
were 
in

boards, 
dry

thatch 
from 
the 
roofs, 
for 
the
campfires, 
or 
wattle 
fences 
to 
serve 
for 
shelter.

Some 
fifteen 
men 
with 
merry 
shouts 
were 
shaking 
down 
the 
high 
wattle
wall 
of<p>
a 
shed, 
the 
roof 
of<p>
which 
had 
already 
been 
removed.

"Now 
then, 
all 
together-shove!" 
cried 
the 
voices, 
and 
the 
huge 
surface
of 
the 
wall, 
sprinkled 
with 
snow 
and 
creaking 
with 
frost, 
was 
seen
swaying 
in 
the 
gloom 
of 
the 
night. 
The 
lower 
stakes 
cracked 
more 
and
more 
and 
at 
last 
the 
wall 
fell, 
and 
with 
it 
the 
men 
who 
had 
been 
pushing
it. 
Loud, 
coarse 
laughter 
and 
joyous 
shouts 
ensued.

"Now 
then, 
catch 
hold 
in 
twos! 
Hand 
up 
the 
lever! 
That's 
it.... 
Where
are 
you 
shoving

"Now, 
all 
together! 
<a href="/cZl/PK8tHLaX8sfA3mTUVM.html">But</a> 
wait 
a 
moment, 
boys... 
With 
a 
song!"

All 
stood 
silent, 
and 
a 
soft, 
pleasant 
velvety 
voice 
began 
to 
sing. 
At
the 
end 
of 
the<p>
third 
verse 
as 
the 
last 
note 
died 
away, 
twenty 
voices
roared 
out 
at 
once: 
"Oo-oo-oo-oo! 
That's 
it. 
All 
together! 
Heave 
away,
boys!..." 
but 
despite 
their 
united 
efforts 
the 
wattle 
hardly 
moved, 
and
in 
the 
silence 
that 
followed 
the 
heavy 
breathing 
of 
the 
men 
was 
audible.

"Here, 
you 
of 
the 
Sixth<p>
Company! 
Devils 
that 
you 
are! 
Lend 
a 
hand...
will 
you? 
You 
may 
want 
us 
one 
of 
these 
days."

Some 
twenty 
men 
of 
the 
Sixth 
Company 
who 
were 
on 
their 
way<p>
into 
the
village 
joined 
the 
haulers, 
and 
the 
wattle 
wall, 
which 
was 
about
thirty-five 
feet 
long 
and 
seven 
feet 
high, 
moved 
forward 
along 
the
village 
street, 
swaying, 
pressing 
upon 
and 
cutting 
the 
shoulders 
of 
the
gasping 
men.

"Get 
along... 
Falling? 
What 
are 
you 
stopping 
for? 
There 
now...."

Merry<p>
senseless 
words 
of 
abuse 
flowed 
freely.

"What 
are 
you 
up 
to?" 
suddenly 
came 
the 
authoritative 
voice 
of 
a
sergeant 
major 
who 
came 
upon 
the 
men 
who 
were 
hauling 
their 
burden.
"There 
are 
gentry 
here; 
the 
general 
himself<p>
is 
in 
that 
hut, 
and 
you
foul-mouthed 
devils, 
you 
brutes, 
I'll 
give 
it 
to 
you!" 
shouted 
he,
hitting 
the 
first 
man 
who 
came 
in 
his 
way 
a 
swinging 
blow 
on 
the 
back.
"Can't 
you 
make 
less 
noise?"

The 
men 
became 
silent. 
The 
soldier 
who 
had 
been 
struck 
groaned 
and 
wiped
his 
face, 
which 
had 
been 
scratched 
till 
it 
bled 
by 
his 
falling 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Jm1CX6GCnw3NX.html">against
the</a> 
wattle.

"There, 
how 
that 
devil 
hits 
out! 
He's 
<a href="/cZl/Lg4mbmX92JyP.html">made</a> 
my 
face 
all 
bloody," 
said<p>
he
in 
a 
frightened 
whisper 
when 
the 
sergeant 
major 
had 
passed 
on.

"Don't 
you 
like 
it?" 
said 
a 
laughing 
voice, 
and 
moderating 
their 
tones
the 
men 
moved 
forward.

When 
they 
were 
out 
of 
the 
village 
they 
began 
talking 
again 
as 
loud 
as
before, 
interlarding 
their 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ayy3vZzpo4i7MdWa.html">talk</a> 
with 
the 
same 
aimless 
expletives.

In 
the 
hut 
which 
the 
men 
had 
passed, 
the 
chief 
officers 
had 
gathered 
and
were 
in 
animated 
talk 
over 
their 
tea 
about 
the 
events 
of 
the 
day 
and 
the
maneuvers 
suggested 
for 
tomorrow. 
It 
was 
proposed 
to 
make 
a 
flank 
march
to 
the 
left, 
cut 
off 
the 
Vice-King 
(Murat) 
and 
capture 
him.

By 
the 
time 
the 
soldiers 
had 
dragged 
the 
wattle 
fence 
to 
its 
place
the 
campfires 
were 
blazing 
on 
all 
sides 
ready 
for 
cooking, 
the 
wood
crackled, 
the 
snow 
was 
melting, 
and 
black 
shadows 
of 
soldiers 
flitted
to 
and 
fro 
all 
over 
the 
occupied 
space 
where 
the 
snow 
had 
been 
trodden
down.

Axes 
and 
choppers 
were 
plied 
all 
around. 
Everything 
was 
done 
without 
any
orders 
being 
given. 
Stores 
of 
wood 
were 
brought 
for 
the 
night, 
shelters
were 
rigged 
up 
for 
the 
officers, 
caldrons 
were 
being 
boiled, 
and 
muskets
and 
accouterments 
put 
in 
order.

When 
Pierre 
saw 
his</h1>neighbor 
next 
morning 
at 
dawn
the 
first 
impression 
of 
him, 
as 
of 
something 
round, 
was 
fully 
confirmed:
Platon's 
whole 
figure-in 
a 
French 
overcoat 
girdled 
with 
a 
cord, 
a
soldier's 
cap, 
and 
bast 
shoes-was 
round. 
His 
head 
was 
quite 
round, 
his
back, 
chest, 
shoulders, 
and 
even 
his 
arms, 
which 
he 
held 
as 
if 
ever
ready 
to 
embrace 
something, 
were 
rounded, 
his 
pleasant 
smile 
and 
his
large, 
gentle 
brown 
eyes 
were 
also 
round.

Platon 
Karataev 
must 
have 
been 
fifty, 
judging 
by 
his 
stories 
of
campaigns 
he 
had 
been 
in, 
told 
as 
by 
an 
old 
soldier. 
He 
did 
not 
himself
know 
his 
age 
and 
was<p>
quite 
<a href="/cZl/Zb730NY.html">unable</a> 
to 
determine 
it. 
But 
his 
brilliantly
white, 
strong 
teeth 
which 
showed 
in 
two 
unbroken 
semicircles 
when 
he
laughed-as 
he 
often 
did-were 
all 
sound 
and 
good, 
there 
was 
not 
a 
gray
hair 
in 
his 
beard 
or 
on 
his 
head, 
and 
his 
whole 
body 
gave 
an 
impression
of 
suppleness 
and 
especially 
of 
firmness 
and 
endurance.

His 
face, 
despite 
its 
fine, 
rounded 
wrinkles, 
had 
an 
expression 
of
innocence 
and 
youth, 
his 
voice 
was 
pleasant 
and 
musical. 
But 
the 
chief
peculiarity 
of 
his 
speech 
was 
its 
directness 
and 
appositeness. 
It 
was
evident 
that 
he 
never 
considered 
what 
he 
had 
said 
or 
was 
going 
to 
say,
and 
consequently 
the 
rapidity 
and 
justice 
of 
his<p>
intonation 
had 
an
irresistible 
persuasiveness.

His 
physical 
strength 
and 
agility 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/RH2qQqw13.html">during</a> 
the 
first 
days 
of 
his
imprisonment 
were 
such 
that 
<a href="/cZl/Zdn31xHdu.html">he</a> 
seemed 
not 
to 
know 
what 
fatigue 
and
sickness 
meant. 
Every 
night 
before 
lying 
down, 
he 
said: 
"Lord, 
lay 
me
down 
as 
a 
stone 
and 
raise 
me 
up 
as 
a 
loaf!" 
and 
every 
morning 
on 
getting
up, 
he 
said: 
"I 
lay 
down 
and 
curled 
up, 
I 
get 
up 
and 
shake 
myself." 
And
indeed 
he 
only 
had 
to 
lie 
down, 
to 
fall 
asleep<p>
like 
a 
stone, 
and 
he
only 
had 
to 
shake 
himself, 
to 
be 
ready 
without 
a 
moment's 
delay 
for 
some
work, 
just 
as 
children 
are 
ready 
to 
play 
directly 
they 
awake. 
He 
could
do 
everything, 
not 
very 
well 
but 
not 
badly. 
He 
baked, 
cooked, 
sewed,
planed, 
and 
mended 
boots. 
He 
was 
always 
busy, 
and 
only 
at 
night 
allowed
himself 
conversation-of 
which 
he 
was 
fond-and 
songs. 
He 
did 
not 
sing
like 
a 
trained 
singer 
who 
knows 
he 
is 
listened 
to,<p>
but 
like 
the 
birds,
evidently 
giving 
vent 
to 
the 
sounds 
in 
the 
same 
way 
that 
one 
stretches
oneself 
or 
walks 
about 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
stiffness, 
and 
the 
sounds 
were
always 
high-pitched, 
mournful, 
delicate, 
and 
almost 
feminine, 
and 
his
face 
at 
such 
times 
was 
very 
serious.

Having 
been 
taken 
prisoner 
and 
allowed 
his 
beard 
to 
grow, 
he 
seemed 
to
have 
thrown 
off 
all 
that 
had 
been 
forced 
upon 
him-everything 
military
and 
alien 
to 
himself-and 
had 
returned 
to 
his 
former 
peasant 
habits.

"A 
soldier 
on 
leave-a 
shirt 
outside 
breeches," 
he 
would 
say.

He 
did 
not 
like 
talking 
about 
his 
life 
as 
a 
soldier, 
though 
he 
did 
not
complain, 
and 
often 
mentioned 
that 
he 
had 
not 
been 
flogged 
once 
during
the 
whole 
of 
his 
army<p>
service. 
When 
he 
related 
anything 
it 
was 
generally
some 
old 
and 
evidently 
precious 
memory 
of 
his 
"Christian" 
life, 
as 
he
called 
his 
peasant 
existence. 
The 
proverbs, 
of 
which 
his 
talk 
was 
full,
were 
for 
the 
most 
part 
not 
the 
coarse 
and 
indecent 
saws 
soldiers
employ, 
but 
those 
folk 
sayings 
which 
taken 
without 
a 
context 
seem 
so
insignificant,

to 
prepare 
him 
if 
he 
is 
so 
ill.
We 
women, 
Prince," 
and 
she 
smiled 
tenderly, 
"always 
know 
how 
to 
say
these 
things. 
I 
absolutely 
must 
see 
him, 
however 
painful 
it 
may 
be 
for
me. 
I 
am<p>
used 
to 
suffering."

Evidently 
the 
prince 
understood 
her, 
and 
also 
understood, 
as 
he 
had 
done
at 
Anna 
Pavlovna's, 
that 
it 
would 
be 
difficult 
to 
get 
rid 
of 
Anna
Mikhaylovna.

"Would 
not 
such 
a 
<a href="/cZl/jRO3YXnB5A5mDKi.html">meeting</a> 
be 
too 
trying 
for 
him, 
dear 
Anna
Mikhaylovna?" 
said 
he. 
"Let 
us 
wait 
until 
evening. 
The 
doctors 
are
expecting 
a 
crisis."

"But 
one 
cannot 
delay, 
Prince, 
at 
such 
a 
moment! 
Consider 
that 
the
welfare 
of 
his 
soul 
is<p>
at 
stake. 
Ah, 
it 
is 
awful: 
the 
duties 
of 
a
Christian..."

A 
door 
of 
one 
of 
the 
inner 
rooms 
opened 
and 
one 
of 
the 
princesses, 
the
count's 
niece, 
entered 
with 
a 
cold, 
stern 
face. 
The 
length 
of 
her
body 
was 
strikingly 
out 
of 
proportion 
to 
her 
short 
legs. 
Prince 
Vasili
turned 
to 
her.

"Well, 
how 
is 
he?"

"Still 
the 
same; 
but 
what 
can 
you 
expect, 
this 
noise..." 
said 
the
princess, 
looking 
at 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
as 
at 
a 
stranger.

"Ah, 
my 
dear, 
I 
hardly 
knew 
you," 
said 
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
with 
a
happy 
smile, 
ambling 
lightly 
up 
to 
the 
count's 
niece. 
"I 
have 
come,
and 
am 
at 
your 
service 
to 
help 
you 
nurse 
my 
uncle. 
I 
imagine<p>
what 
you
have 
gone 
through," 
and 
she 
sympathetically 
turned 
up 
her 
eyes.

The 
princess 
gave 
no 
reply 
and 
did 
not 
even 
smile, 
but 
left 
the 
room 
as
Anna 
Mikhaylovna 
took 
off 
her 
gloves 
and, 
occupying 
the 
position 
she
had 
conquered, 
settled 
down 
in 
an 
armchair, 
inviting 
Prince 
Vasili 
to
take 
a 
seat 
beside 
her.

"Boris," 
she 
said 
to 
her 
son 
with 
a 
smile, 
"I 
shall 
go 
in 
to 
see
the 
count, 
my 
uncle; 
but 
you, 
my 
dear, 
had 
better 
go 
to 
Pierre 
meanwhile
and<p>
don't 
forget 
to 
give 
him 
the 
Rostovs' 
invitation. 
They 
ask 
him
to 
dinner. 
I 
suppose 
he 
won't 
go?" 
she 
continued, 
turning 
to 
the
prince.

"On 
the 
contrary," 
replied 
the 
prince, 
who 
had 
plainly 
become
depressed, 
"I 
shall 
be 
only 
too 
glad 
if 
you 
relieve 
me 
of 
that 
young
man.... 
<a href="/cZl/xh7tHLaX5Z.html">Here</a> 
he 
<a href="/cZl/qZ41SUlC6ZNkA.html">is,</a> 
and 
the 
count 
has 
not 
once 
asked 
for 
him."

He 
shrugged 
his 
shoulders. 
A 
footman 
conducted 
Boris 
down 
one 
flight 
of
stairs 
and 
up 
another, 
to 
Pierre's 
rooms.





CHAPTER 
XVI

Pierre, 
after 
all, 
had 
not 
managed 
to 
choose 
a 
career 
for 
himself 
in
Petersburg, 
and 
had 
been 
expelled 
from 
there 
for 
riotous 
conduct 
and
sent 
to 
Moscow. 
The 
story 
told 
about 
him 
at 
Count 
Rostov's 
was 
true.
Pierre 
had 
taken 
part 
in 
tying 
a 
policeman 
to 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/dN1HV5vWPe9O.html">bear.</a> 
He 
had 
now 
been
for 
some 
days 
in 
Moscow 
and 
was 
staying 
as 
usual 
at 
his 
father's
house. 
Though 
he 
expected 
that 
the 
story 
of 
his 
escapade 
would 
be
already 
known 
in 
Moscow 
and 
that 
the 
ladies 
about 
his 
father-who 
were
never 
favorably 
disposed 
toward 
him-would 
have 
used 
it 
to 
turn 
the
count 
against<p>
him, 
he 
nevertheless 
on 
the 
day 
of 
his 
arrival 
went 
to
his 
father's 
part 
of 
the 
house. 
Entering 
the 
drawing 
room, 
where 
the
princesses 
spent 
most 
of 
their 
time,

"She's

She

thought 
she 
heard, 
the 
names 
of 
Kuragin 
and 
Bolkonski. 
But
she 
was 
always 
imagining 
that. 
It 
always 
seemed 
to 
her 
that 
everyone
who 
looked 
at 
her 
was 
thinking 
only 
of 
what 
had 
happened 
to 
her. 
With 
a
sinking 
heart, 
wretched 
as 
she 
always 
was 
now 
when 
she 
found 
herself
in 
a 
crowd, 
Natasha 
in 
her 
lilac 
silk 
dress 
trimmed 
with 
black 
lace
walked-as 
women 
can 
walk-with 
the 
more 
repose 
and 
stateliness 
the
greater 
the 
pain 
and 
shame 
in 
her 
soul. 
She 
knew 
for 
certain 
that 
she
was 
pretty, 
but 
this 
no 
longer 
gave 
her 
satisfaction 
as 
it 
used 
to.
On 
the 
contrary 
it 
tormented 
her 
more 
than 
anything 
else 
of 
late, 
and
particularly 
so 
on 
this 
bright, 
hot 
summer 
day 
in 
town. 
"It's 
Sunday
again-another 
week 
past," 
she 
thought, 
recalling 
that 
she 
had 
been 
here
the 
Sunday 
before, 
"and 
always 
the

life 
that

no

and 
the

in 
which 
it 
used 
to 
be

easy 
to

I'm

I'm

and 
I

I

I 
used

now 
I

she 
thought, 
"but 
yet 
my

years 
are 
slipping 
by
and 
are 
no

to

She 
stood 
by 
her 
mother's 
side 
and 
exchanged
nods 
with 
acquaintances 
near 
her. 
From 
habit 
she 
scrutinized 
the 
ladies'
dresses, 
condemned 
the 
bearing 
of 
a 
lady 
standing 
close 
by 
who 
was 
not
crossing 
herself 
properly 
but 
in 
a 
cramped 
manner, 
and 
again 
she 
thought
with 
vexation 
that 
she 
was 
herself 
being 
judged 
and 
was 
judging 
others,
and 
suddenly, 
at 
the 
sound 
of 
the 
service, 
she 
felt 
horrified 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Mv1Gj01OpC.html">at</a> 
her<p>
own
vileness, 
horrified 
that 
the 
former 
purity 
of 
her 
soul 
was

lost 
to
her.

A 
comely, 
fresh-looking 
old 
man 
was 
conducting 
the 
service 
with 
that
mild 
solemnity 
which 
has 
so 
elevating 
and 
soothing 
an 
effect 
on 
the
souls 
of 
the 
worshipers. 
The 
gates 
of 
the 
sanctuary 
screen 
were 
closed,
the 
curtain 
was 
slowly 
drawn, 
and 
from 
behind 
it 
a 
soft 
mysterious 
voice
pronounced 
some 
words. 
Tears, 
the 
cause 
of 
which 
she 
herself 
did 
not
understand, 
made 
Natasha's 
breast 
heave, 
and 
a 
joyous 
but 
oppressive
feeling 
agitated 
her.

"Teach 
me 
what 
I 
should 
do, 
how 
to 
live 
my 
life, 
how 
I 
may 
grow 
good
forever, 
forever!" 
she 
pleaded.

The 
deacon 
came 
out 
onto 
the 
raised 
space 
before 
the 
altar 
screen 
and,
holding 
his 
thumb 
extended, 
drew 
his 
long 
hair 
from 
under 
his 
dalmatic
and, 
making 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
cross 
on 
his 
breast, 
began 
in 
a 
loud 
and
solemn 
voice 
to 
recite 
the 
words 
of 
the 
prayer....

"In 
peace 
let 
us 
pray 
unto 
the 
Lord."

"As 
one 
community, 
without 
distinction 
of 
class, 
without 
enmity, 
united
by 
brotherly 
love-let 
us 
pray!" 
thought 
Natasha.

"For<p>
the 
peace 
that 
is 
from 
above, 
and 
for 
the 
salvation 
of 
our 
souls."

"For 
the 
world 
of 
angels 
and 
all 
the 
spirits 
who 
dwell 
above 
us," 
prayed
Natasha.

When 
they 
prayed 
for 
the 
warriors, 
she 
thought<p>
of 
her 
brother 
and
Denisov. 
When 
they 
prayed 
for 
all 
traveling 
by 
land 
and 
sea, 
she
remembered 
Prince 
Andrew, 
prayed 
for 
him, 
and 
asked 
God 
to 
forgive 
her
all 
the 
wrongs 
she 
had 
done 
him. 
When 
they 
prayed 
for 
those 
who 
love 
us,
she 
prayed 
for 
the 
members 
of 
her 
own 
family, 
her 
father 
and 
mother 
and
Sonya, 
realizing 
for 
the 
first 
time 
how 
wrongly 
she 
had 
acted

Pierre

this 
large 
room 
divided 
by 
columns 
and 
an 
arch, 
its
walls 
hung 
round 
with 
Persian 
carpets. 
The 
part 
of 
the 
room 
behind 
the
columns, 
with 
a 
high 
silk-curtained 
mahogany 
bedstead 
on 
one 
side 
and
on 
the 
other 
an 
immense 
case 
containing 
icons, 
was 
brightly 
illuminated
with 
red 
light 
like 
a 
Russian 
church 
during 
evening 
service. 
Under
the 
gleaming 
icons 
stood 
a 
long 
invalid 
chair, 
and 
in 
that 
chair
on 
snowy-white 
smooth 
pillows, 
evidently 
freshly 
changed, 
Pierre
saw-covered 
to 
the 
waist 
by 
a 
bright 
green 
quilt-the 
familiar,
majestic 
figure 
of 
his 
father, 
Count 
Bezukhov, 
with 
that 
gray 
mane 
of
hair 
above 
his<p>

reminded 
one

the

A

she

a 
long 
time-that

hundreds

agreeably

called 
up 
a 
whole 
crowd 
of 
memories, 
desires 
and
emotions 
associated 
with 
that 
feeling.

The 
two 
remarkably 
pretty 
girls, 
Natasha 
and 
Sonya, 
with 
Count 
Rostov
who 
had 
not 
been 
seen 
in 
Moscow 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
attracted 
general
attention. 
Moreover, 
everybody 
knew 
vaguely 
of 
Natasha's 
engagement
to 
Prince 
Andrew, 
and 
knew 
that 
the 
Rostovs 
had 
lived 
in 
the 
country
ever 
since, 
and 
all 
looked 
with 
curiosity 
at 
a 
fiancee 
who 
was 
making
one

the 
best 
matches 
in 
Russia.

Natasha's 
looks, 
as 
everyone 
told

had 
improved 
in 
the 
country,
and 
that 
evening 
thanks 
to

she 
was

She 
struck 
those

her 
by 
her 
fullness 
of 
life 
and 
beauty,
combined 
with 
her 
indifference 
to 
everything 
about 
her. 
Her 
black 
eyes
looked 
at 
the 
crowd 
without

anyone,

her 
delicate

Bennigsen, 
who, 
like 
all</h1>on 
whom 
Boris
had 
been 
in 
attendance, 
considered 
young 
Prince 
Drubetskoy 
an 
invaluable
man.

In 
the 
higher 
command 
there 
were 
two 
sharply 
defined 
parties: 
Kutuzov's
party 
and 
that 
of 
Bennigsen, 
the 
chief 
of 
staff. 
Boris 
belonged 
to 
the
latter 
and 
no 
one 
else, 
while 
showing 
servile 
respect 
to 
Kutuzov, 
could
so 
create 
an 
impression 
that 
the 
old 
fellow 
was 
<a href="/cZl/PU4bKMVG07ZR.html">not</a> 
much 
good 
and 
that
Bennigsen 
managed 
everything. 
Now 
the 
decisive 
moment 
of 
battle 
had 
come
when 
Kutuzov 
would<p>
be 
destroyed 
and 
the 
power 
pass 
to 
Bennigsen, 
or 
even
if 
<a href="/aVzUge/wm8HI4Uo5Q.html">Kutuzov</a> 
won 
the 
battle 
it 
would 
be 
felt 
that 
everything 
was 
done 
by
Bennigsen. 
In 
any 
case 
many 
great

So 
Boris 
was
full 
of 
nervous 
vivacity 
all 
day.

After 
Kaysarov, 
others 
whom 
Pierre 
knew 
came 
up 
to 
him, 
and 
he 
had 
not
time 
to 
reply 
to 
all 
the 
questions 
about 
Moscow 
that 
were 
showered 
upon
him, 
or 
to 
listen 
to 
all 
that 
was 
told 
him. 
The 
faces 
all 
expressed
animation 
and 
apprehension, 
but<p>
it 
seemed 
to 
Pierre 
that 
the 
cause 
of
the 
excitement 
shown 
in 
some 
of 
these 
faces 
lay 
chiefly 
in 
questions
of 
personal 
success; 
his 
mind, 
however, 
was 
occupied 
by 
the 
different
expression 
he 
saw<p>
on 
other 
faces-an 
expression 
that 
spoke 
not 
of
personal 
matters 
but 
of 
the 
universal 
questions 
of 
life 
and 
death.
Kutuzov 
noticed 
Pierre's 
figure 
and 
the 
group 
gathered 
round 
him.

"Call

Rostov

to

and 
saw 
Telyanin's 
horse 
at 
the 
porch.

In 
the 
second 
room 
of 
the 
inn 
the 
lieutenant 
was 
sitting 
over 
a 
dish 
of
sausages 
and 
a 
bottle 
of 
wine.

"Ah, 
you've 
come 
here 
too, 
young 
man!" 
he 
said, 
smiling 
and
raising 
his 
eyebrows.

"Yes," 
said 
Rostov 
as 
if 
it 
cost 
him 
a 
great 
deal 
to 
utter 
the
word; 
and 
he 
sat<p>
down 
at 
the 
nearest 
table.

Both 
were 
silent. 
There 
were 
two 
Germans 
and 
a 
Russian 
officer 
in 
the
room. 
No 
one 
spoke 
and 
the 
only 
sounds 
heard 
were 
the 
clatter 
of 
knives
and 
the 
munching 
of 
the 
lieutenant.

When 
Telyanin 
had 
finished 
his 
lunch 
he 
took 
out 
of 
his 
pocket 
a 
double
purse 
and, 
drawing 
its 
rings 
aside 
with 
his 
small, 
white, 
turned-up
fingers, 
drew 
out 
a 
gold 
imperial, 
and 
lifting 
his 
eyebrows 
gave 
it 
to
the 
waiter.

"Please 
be 
quick," 
he 
said.

The 
coin 
was 
a 
new 
one.<p>
Rostov 
rose 
and 
went 
up 
to 
Telyanin.

"Allow 
me 
to 
look 
at 
your 
purse," 
he 
said 
in 
a 
low, 
almost
inaudible, 
voice.

With 
shifting 
eyes 
but 
eyebrows 
still 
raised, 
Telyanin 
handed 
him 
the
purse.

"Yes, 
it's 
a 
nice 
purse. 
Yes, 
yes," 
he 
said, 
growing 
suddenly
pale, 
and 
added, 
"Look 
at 
it, 
young 
man."

Rostov 
took 
the 
purse 
in<p>
his 
hand, 
examined 
it 
and 
the 
money 
in 
it, 
and
looked 
at 
Telyanin. 
The 
lieutenant 
was 
looking 
about 
in 
his 
usual 
way
and 
suddenly 
seemed 
to 
grow 
very 
merry.

"If 
we 
get 
to 
Vienna 
I'll 
get 
rid 
of 
it 
there 
but 
in 
these 
wretched
little 
towns 
there's 
nowhere 
to 
spend 
it," 
said 
he. 
"Well, 
let 
me
have 
it, 
young 
man, 
I'm 
going."

Rostov 
did 
not 
speak.

"And 
you? 
Are 
you 
going 
to 
have 
lunch 
too? 
They 
feed 
you 
quite
decently 
here," 
continued 
Telyanin. 
"Now 
then, 
let 
me 
have 
it."

He 
stretched 
out 
his 
hand 
to 
take 
hold 
of 
the 
purse. 
Rostov 
let 
go 
of
it. 
Telyanin 
took 
the 
purse 
and 
began 
carelessly 
slipping 
it 
into 
the
pocket 
of 
his 
riding 
breeches, 
with 
his 
eyebrows 
lifted 
and 
his 
mouth
slightly 
open, 
as 
if 
to 
say, 
"Yes, 
yes, 
I 
am 
putting 
my 
purse 
in 
my
pocket 
and 
that's 
quite 
simple 
and 
is 
no 
one 
else's 
business."

"Well, 
young 
man?" 
he 
said 
with 
a 
sigh, 
and 
from 
under 
his 
lifted
brows 
he 
glanced 
into 
Rostov's 
eyes.

Some 
flash 
as 
of 
an 
electric 
spark 
shot 
from 
Telyanin's 
eyes 
to
Rostov's 
and 
back, 
and 
back 
again 
and 
again 
in 
an 
instant.

"Come 
here," 
said 
Rostov, 
catching 
hold 
of 
Telyanin's 
arm 
and
almost 
dragging 
him 
to 
the 
window. 
"That 
money 
is 
Denisov's; 
you
took 
it..." 
he 
whispered 
just 
above 
Telyanin's 
ear.

"What? 
What? 
How 
dare 
you? 
What?" 
said 
Telyanin.

But 
these 
words 
came 
like 
a 
piteous, 
despairing 
cry 
and 
an 
entreaty 
for
pardon.

continued 
for 
a 
considerable
time, 
had 
begun 
to<p>
sound 
like 
a 
sad 
reminiscence 
to 
Natasha's 
ears.
She 
wanted 
to 
cry. 
Peronskaya 
had 
left 
them. 
The 
count 
was 
at 
the
other 
end 
of 
the 
room. 
She 
and 
the 
countess 
and 
Sonya 
were 
standing 
by
themselves 
as 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
a 
forest 
amid 
that 
crowd 
of 
strangers,
with 
no 
one 
interested 
in 
them 
and 
not 
wanted 
by 
anyone. 
Prince 
Andrew
with 
a 
lady 
passed 
by, 
evidently 
not 
recognizing 
them. 
The 
handsome
Anatole 
was 
smilingly 
talking 
to 
a 
partner 
on 
his 
arm 
and 
looked 
at
Natasha 
as 
one 
looks 
at 
a 
wall. 
Boris 
passed 
them 
twice 
and 
each 
time
turned 
away. 
Berg 
and 
his 
wife, 
who 
were 
not 
dancing, 
came 
up 
to 
them.

This 
family 
gathering 
seemed 
humiliating 
to 
Natasha-as 
if 
there 
were
nowhere 
else 
for 
the 
family 
to 
talk 
but 
here 
at 
the 
ball. 
She 
did 
not
listen 
to 
or 
look 
at 
Vera, 
who 
was 
telling 
her 
something 
about 
her 
own
green 
dress.

At 
last 
the 
Emperor 
stopped 
beside 
his 
last 
partner 
(he 
had 
danced
with 
three) 
and 
the 
music 
ceased. 
A 
worried 
aide-de-camp 
ran 
up 
to 
the
Rostovs 
requesting 
them 
to 
stand 
farther 
back, 
though 
as 
it 
was 
they
were 
already 
close 
to 
the 
wall, 
and 
from 
the 
gallery 
resounded 
the
distinct, 
precise, 
enticingly 
rhythmical 
strains 
of 
a 
waltz. 
The 
Emperor
looked 
smilingly 
down 
the 
room. 
A 
minute 
passed 
but 
no 
one 
had 
yet 
begun
dancing. 
An 
aide-de-camp, 
the 
Master 
of 
Ceremonies, 
went 
up 
to 
Countess
Bezukhova 
and 
asked 
her 
to 
dance. 
She 
smilingly 
raised 
her 
hand 
and
laid<p>
it 
on 
his 
shoulder 
without 
looking 
at 
him. 
The 
aide-de-camp, 
an
adept 
in 
his 
art, 
grasping 
his 
partner 
firmly 
round 
her 
waist, 
with
confident 
deliberation 
started 
smoothly, 
gliding 
first 
round 
the 
edge 
of
the 
circle, 
then 
at 
the 
corner 
of 
the 
room 
he 
caught 
Helene's
left 
hand 
and 
turned 
her, 
the 
only 
sound 
audible, 
apart 
from 
the
ever-quickening 
music, 
being 
the 
rhythmic 
click 
of 
the 
spurs 
on 
his
rapid, 
agile 
feet, 
while 
at 
every 
third 
beat 
his 
partner's 
velvet
dress 
spread 
out 
and 
seemed 
to 
flash 
as 
she 
whirled 
round. 
Natasha
gazed 
at 
them 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
cry 
because 
it 
was 
not 
she 
who 
was
dancing 
that 
first 
turn 
of 
the 
waltz.

Prince 
Andrew, 
in 
the 
white 
uniform 
of 
a 
cavalry 
colonel, 
wearing
stockings 
and 
dancing 
shoes, 
stood 
looking 
animated 
and 
bright 
in 
the
front 
row 
of 
the 
circle 
not 
far 
from 
the 
Rostovs. 
Baron 
Firhoff 
was
talking 
to 
him 
about 
the 
first 
sitting 
of 
the 
Council 
of 
State 
to 
be
held 
next 
day. 
Prince 
Andrew, 
as 
one 
closely 
connected 
with 
Speranski
and 
participating 
in 
the 
work 
of 
the

CHAPTER 
XIX

What 
Russian, 
reading 
the 
account 
of 
the 
last 
part 
of 
the 
campaign
of 
1812, 
has 
not 
experienced 
an 
uncomfortable 
<a href="/cZl/Sj2GLY4PdQ.html">feeling</a> 
of 
regret,
dissatisfaction, 
and 
perplexity? 
Who 
has 
not 
asked 
himself 
how 
it 
is
that 
the 
French 
were 
not 
all 
captured 
or 
destroyed 
when 
our 
three 
armies
surrounded 
<a href="/aVzUge/PN38Yg1sbb.html">them</a> 
in 
superior 
numbers, 
when 
the 
disordered 
French, 
hungry
and 
freezing, 
surrendered 
in 
crowds, 
and 
when 
(as 
the 
historians 
relate)
the 
aim 
of 
the 
Russians 
was 
to 
stop 
the 
French, 
to 
cut 
them 
off, 
and
capture 
them 
all?

How 
was 
it 
that 
the 
Russian 
army, 
which 
when 
numerically 
weaker 
than 
the
French 
had 
given 
battle 
at 
Borodino, 
did 
not 
achieve 
its 
purpose 
when 
it
had 
surrounded 
the 
French 
on 
three 
sides 
and 
when 
its 
aim 
was 
to 
capture
them? 
Can 
the 
French 
be 
so 
enormously 
superior 
to 
us 
that 
when 
we 
had
surrounded 
them 
with 
superior 
forces 
we 
could 
not 
beat 
them? 
How 
could
that 
happen?

History 
<a href="/aVzUge/SvD6UQ4ReoD7Y.html">(or</a> 
what 
is 
called 
by 
that 
name) 
replying 
to 
these 
questions
says 
that 
this 
occurred 
because 
Kutuzov 
and 
Tormasov 
and 
Chichagov, 
and
this 
man 
and 
that 
man,<p>
did 
not 
execute 
such 
and 
such 
maneuvers....

But 
why 
did 
they 
not 
execute 
those 
maneuvers? 
And 
why 
if 
they 
were
guilty 
of 
not 
carrying 
out 
a 
prearranged 
plan 
were 
they 
not 
tried 
and
punished? 
But 
even 
if 
we 
admitted 
that 
Kutuzov, 
Chichagov, 
and<p>
others
were 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
Russian 
failures, 
it 
is 
still 
incomprehensible
why, 
the 
position 
of 
the 
Russian 
army 
being 
what 
it 
was 
at 
Krasnoe 
and
at 
the 
Berezina 
(in 
both 
cases 
we 
had 
superior 
forces), 
<a href="/cZl/IE2S0T.html">the</a> 
French 
army
with 
its 
marshals, 
kings, 
and 
Emperor 
was 
not 
captured, 
if 
that 
was 
what
the 
Russians 
aimed 
at.

The 
explanation 
of 
this 
strange 
fact 
given<p>
by 
Russian 
military
historians 
(to 
the 
effect 
that 
Kutuzov 
hindered 
an 
attack) 
is 
unfounded,
for 
we 
know 
that 
he 
could 
not 
restrain 
the 
troops 
from 
attacking 
at
Vyazma 
and 
Tarutino.

Why 
was 
the 
Russian 
army-which 
with 
inferior 
forces 
had 
withstood 
the
enemy 
in 
full 
strength 
at 
Borodino-defeated 
at 
Krasnoe 
and 
the 
Berezina
by 
the 
disorganized<p>
crowds 
of 
the 
French 
when 
it 
was 
numerically
superior?

Sonya

could 
hardly

was
transparently 
radiant 
with 
impulsive

Natasha 
no 
less 
proud 
of 
her 
first 
long 
dress 
and 
of 
being 
at 
a 
real
ball 
was 
even 
happier. 
They 
were 
both 
dressed 
in 
white 
muslin 
with 
pink
ribbons.

Natasha 
fell 
in<p>
love 
the 
very 
moment 
she 
entered 
the 
ballroom. 
She
was 
not 
in 
love 
with 
anyone 
in 
particular, 
but 
with 
everyone. 
Whatever
person 
she 
happened 
to 
look 
at 
she 
was 
in 
love 
with 
for 
that 
moment.

"Oh, 
how 
delightful 
it 
is!" 
she 
kept 
saying, 
running 
up 
to 
Sonya.

Nicholas 
and 
Denisov 
were 
walking 
up 
and 
down, 
looking 
with 
kindly
patronage 
at 
the 
dancers.

"How 
sweet 
she 
is-she 
will 
be 
a 
weal 
beauty!" 
said 
Denisov.

"Who?"

"Countess 
Natasha," 
answered 
Denisov.

"And 
how 
she 
dances! 
What 
gwace!" 
he 
said 
again 
after 
a 
pause.

"Who 
are 
you 
talking 
about?"

"About 
your 
sister," 
ejaculated 
Denisov 
testily.

Rostov 
smiled.

"My 
dear 
count, 
you 
were 
one 
of 
my 
best 
pupils-you 
must 
dance,"
said 
little 
Iogel 
coming 
up 
to 
Nicholas. 
"Look 
how 
many 
charming 
young
ladies-" 
He 
turned 
with 
the 
same 
request 
to 
Denisov 
who 
was 
also 
a
former 
pupil 
of 
his.

"No, 
my 
dear 
fellow, 
I'll 
be 
a<p>
wallflower," 
said 
Denisov.
"Don't 
you 
wecollect 
what 
bad 
use 
I 
made 
of 
your 
lessons?"

"Oh 
no!" 
said 
Iogel, 
hastening 
to 
reassure 
him. 
"You 
were 
only
inattentive, 
but 
you 
had 
talent-oh 
yes, 
you 
had 
talent!"

The 
band 
struck 
up 
the 
newly 
introduced 
mazurka. 
Nicholas 
could 
not
refuse 
Iogel 
and 
asked 
Sonya 
to 
dance. 
Denisov 
sat 
down 
by 
the 
old
ladies 
and, 
leaning 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/pX5XZWkd6KpkPN5XZEHJ.html">on</a> 
his 
saber 
and 
beating 
time 
with 
his 
foot, 
told
them 
something 
funny 
and 
kept 
them 
amused, 
while 
he 
watched 
the 
young
people 
dancing, 
Iogel 
with 
Natasha, 
his 
pride 
and 
his 
best 
pupil, 
were
the 
first 
couple. 
Noiselessly, 
skillfully 
stepping 
with 
his 
little
feet 
in 
low 
shoes, 
Iogel 
flew 
first 
across 
the 
hall 
with 
Natasha, 
who,
though 
shy, 
went 
on 
carefully 
executing 
her 
steps. 
Denisov 
did 
not
take 
his 
eyes 
off 
her 
and 
beat 
time 
with 
his 
saber 
in 
a 
way 
that 
clearly
indicated 
that 
if 
he 
was 
not 
dancing 
it 
was 
because<p>
he 
would 
not 
and 
not
because 
he 
could 
not. 
In 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
figure 
he 
beckoned 
to 
Rostov
who 
was 
passing:

"This 
is 
not 
at 
all 
the 
thing," 
he 
said. 
"What 
sort 
of 
Polish
mazuwka 
is 
this? 
But 
she 
does 
dance 
splendidly."

Knowing 
that 
Denisov 
had 
a 
reputation 
even 
in 
Poland 
for 
the 
masterly
way 
in 
which 
he 
danced 
the 
mazurka, 
Nicholas 
ran 
up 
to 
Natasha:

"Go 
and 
choose 
Denisov. 
He 
is 
a 
real 
dancer, 
a 
wonder!"<p>
he 
said.

When 
it 
came 
to 
Natasha's 
turn 
to 
choose 
a 
partner, 
she 
rose 
and,
tripping 
rapidly 
across 
in 
her 
little 
shoes 
trimmed 
with 
bows, 
ran
timidly 
to 
the 
corner 
where 
Denisov 
sat. 
She 
saw 
that 
everybody 
was
looking 
at 
her 
and 
waiting. 
Nicholas 
saw 
that 
Denisov 
was 
refusing
though 
he 
smiled 
delightedly. 
He 
ran 
up 
to 
them.

"Please, 
Vasili 
Dmitrich," 
Natasha 
was 
saying, 
"do 
come!"

"Oh 
no, 
let 
me 
off, 
Countess," 
Denisov 
replied.

"Now 
then, 
Vaska," 
said 
Nicholas.

"They 
coax 
me 
as 
if 
I 
were 
Vaska 
the 
cat!" 
said 
Denisov 
jokingly.

"I'll 
sing 
for

a

evening," 
said 
Natasha.

"Oh,

the
picture 
of 
his 
death, 
which 
she 
felt 
she 
could 
not 
contemplate 
even 
in
imagination 
at 
this 
still 
and 
mystic 
hour 
of 
night. 
And 
these 
pictures
presented 
themselves 
to 
her 
so 
clearly 
and 
in 
such 
detail 
that 
they
seemed 
now 
present, 
now 
past, 
and 
now<p>
future.

She 
vividly 
recalled 
the 
moment 
when 
he 
had 
his 
first 
stroke 
and 
was
being 
dragged 
along 
by 
his 
armpits 
through 
the 
garden 
at 
Bald 
Hills,
muttering 
something 
with 
his<p>
helpless 
tongue, 
twitching 
his 
gray
eyebrows 
and 
looking 
uneasily 
and 
timidly 
at 
her.

"Even 
then 
he 
wanted 
to 
tell 
me 
what 
he 
told 
me 
the 
day 
he 
died," 
she
thought. 
"He 
had 
always 
thought 
what 
he 
said 
then." 
And 
she 
recalled 
in
all 
its 
detail 
the 
night 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
before 
he 
had 
the 
last 
stroke,
when 
with 
a 
foreboding 
of 
disaster 
she 
had 
remained 
at 
home 
against 
his
will. 
She 
had 
not 
slept 
and 
had 
stolen 
downstairs 
on 
tiptoe, 
and 
going
to 
the 
door 
of 
the 
conservatory 
where 
he 
slept 
that 
night 
had 
listened
at 
the 
door. 
In 
a 
suffering 
and 
weary 
voice 
he 
was 
saying 
something 
to
Tikhon, 
speaking 
of 
the 
Crimea 
and 
its 
warm 
nights 
and 
of 
the 
Empress.
Evidently 
he 
had 
wanted 
to 
talk. 
"And 
why 
didn't 
he 
call 
me? 
Why 
didn't
he 
let 
me 
be 
there 
instead<p>
of 
Tikhon?" 
Princess 
Mary 
had 
thought 
and
thought 
again 
now. 
"Now 
he 
will 
never 
tell 
anyone 
what 
he 
had 
in 
his
soul. 
Never 
will 
that 
moment 
return 
for 
him 
or 
for 
me 
when 
he 
might 
have
said 
all 
he 
longed 
to 
say, 
and 
not 
Tikhon 
but 
I 
might 
have 
heard 
and
understood 
him. 
Why 
didn't 
I 
enter 
the 
room?" 
she 
thought. 
"Perhaps 
he
would 
then 
have 
said 
to 
me 
what 
he<p>
said 
the 
day 
he 
died. 
While 
talking
to 
Tikhon 
he 
asked 
about 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/EJ8iU0FKLE4bmpaY.html">me</a> 
twice. 
He 
wanted<p>
to 
see 
me, 
and 
I 
was
standing 
close 
by, 
outside 
the 
door. 
It 
was 
sad 
and 
painful 
for 
him
to 
talk 
to 
Tikhon 
who 
did 
not 
understand 
him. 
I 
remember 
how 
he 
began
speaking 
to 
him 
about 
<a href="/aVzUge/uqv2NY3epgGc3jl.html">Lise</a> 
as 
if 
she 
were 
alive-he 
had 
forgotten 
she
was 
dead-and 
Tikhon 
reminded 
him 
that 
she 
was 
no 
more, 
and 
he 
shouted,
'Fool!' 
He 
was 
greatly 
depressed. 
From 
behind 
the 
door 
I 
heard 
how 
he
lay 
down 
on 
his 
bed 
groaning 
and 
loudly 
exclaimed, 
'My 
God!' 
Why 
didn't
I 
go 
in 
then? 
What 
could 
he 
have 
done 
to 
me? 
What 
could<p>
I 
have 
lost? 
And
perhaps 
he 
would 
then 
have 
been 
comforted 
and 
would 
have 
said 
that 
word
to 
me." 
And 
Princess 
Mary 
uttered 
aloud 
the 
caressing 
word 
he 
had 
said
to 
her 
on 
the 
day 
of 
his 
death. 
"Dear-est!"<p>
she 
repeated, 
and 
began
sobbing, 
with 
tears 
that 
relieved 
her 
soul. 
She 
now 
saw 
his 
face 
before
her. 
And 
not 
the 
face 
she 
had 
known 
ever 
since 
she 
could 
remember 
and
had 
always 
seen 
at 
a 
distance, 
but 
the 
timid, 
feeble 
face 
she 
had 
seen
for 
the 
first 
time 
quite 
closely, 
with 
all 
its 
wrinkles 
and 
details,
when 
she 
stooped 
near 
to 
his 
mouth 
to 
catch

and

a

animal 
looked 
around 
him 
with 
glittering

Pierre 
was 
no 
longer 
able 
to 
turn 
away 
and 
close<p>
his 
eyes. 
His 
curiosity
and 
agitation, 
like 
that 
of 
the 
whole 
crowd, 
reached 
the 
highest 
pitch
at 
this 
fifth 
murder.<p>
Like 
the

this 
fifth 
man 
seemed 
calm;<p>
he
wrapped 
his 
loose 
cloak 
closer 
and 
rubbed 
one 
bare 
foot 
with 
the 
other.

When 
they 
began 
to 
blindfold 
him 
he 
himself 
adjusted 
the 
knot 
which
hurt 
the 
back 
of 
his 
head; 
then 
when 
they 
propped 
him 
against 
the
bloodstained 
post, 
he 
leaned 
back 
and, 
not 
being 
comfortable 
in 
that
position, 
straightened 
himself, 
adjusted 
his<p>
feet, 
and 
leaned 
back 
again
more 
comfortably. 
Pierre 
did 
not 
take 
his 
eyes 
from 
him 
and 
did 
not 
miss
his 
slightest 
movement.

Probably 
a 
word 
of 
command 
was 
given 
and 
was 
followed 
by<p>
the 
reports 
of
eight 
muskets; 
but 
try 
as 
he 
would 
Pierre 
could 
not 
afterwards 
remember
having 
heard 
the 
slightest 
sound 
of 
the 
shots. 
He 
only 
saw 
how 
the
workman 
suddenly 
sank 
down 
on 
the 
cords 
that 
held 
him, 
how 
blood 
showed
itself 
in 
two 
places, 
how 
the 
ropes 
slackened 
under 
the 
weight 
of 
the
hanging 
body, 
and 
how 
the 
workman 
sat 
down, 
his 
head 
hanging 
unnaturally
and 
one 
leg 
bent 
under 
him. 
Pierre 
ran 
up 
to 
the 
post. 
No 
one 
hindered
him. 
Pale, 
frightened 
people 
were 
doing 
something 
around 
the 
workman.
The 
lower 
jaw 
of 
an 
old 
Frenchman 
with 
a 
thick 
mustache 
trembled 
as 
he
untied 
the 
ropes. 
The 
body 
collapsed. 
The 
soldiers 
dragged 
it 
awkwardly
from 
the 
post 
and 
began 
pushing 
it 
into 
the 
pit.

They 
all 
plainly 
and 
certainly 
knew 
that 
they 
were 
criminals 
who 
must
hide 
the 
traces 
of 
their 
guilt 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible.

Pierre 
glanced 
into 
the 
pit 
and 
saw 
that 
the 
factory 
lad 
was 
lying 
with
his 
knees 
close 
up 
to 
his 
head 
and 
one 
shoulder 
higher 
than 
the 
other.
That 
shoulder 
rose 
and 
fell 
rhythmically 
and 
convulsively, 
but 
spadefuls
of 
earth 
were 
already 
being 
thrown 
over 
the 
whole 
body. 
One 
of 
the
soldiers, 
evidently 
suffering, 
shouted 
gruffly 
and 
angrily 
at 
Pierre 
to
go 
back. 
But 
Pierre 
did 
not 
understand 
him 
and 
remained 
near 
the 
post,
and 
no 
one 
drove 
him 
away.

When 
the 
pit 
had 
been 
filled 
up 
a 
command 
was 
given. 
Pierre 
was 
taken
back 
to 
his 
place, 
and 
the 
rows 
of 
troops 
on 
both 
sides 
of 
the 
post
made 
a 
half 
turn 
and 
went 
past 
it 
at 
a 
measured 
pace. 
The 
twenty-four
sharpshooters 
with 
discharged 
muskets, 
standing 
in 
the 
center 
of 
the
circle, 
ran 
back 
to 
their 
places 
as 
the 
companies 
passed 
by.

Pierre 
gazed 
now 
with 
dazed 
eyes 
at 
these 
sharpshooters 
who 
ran 
in
couples 
out 
of 
the 
circle. 
All 
but 
one 
rejoined 
their 
companies. 
This
one, 
a 
young 
soldier, 
his 
face 
deadly<p>
pale, 
his 
shako 
pushed 
back, 
and
his 
musket 
resting 
on 
the 
ground, 
still 
stood 
near 
the 
pit 
at 
the

had 
fired.

retreat 
during 
the 
finest</h1>period 
of 
summer 
and 
with 
sufficient 
supplies
was 
a 
very 
simple 
and 
agreeable 
business.

It 
was 
only 
at 
headquarters 
that 
there 
was 
depression, 
uneasiness, 
and
intriguing; 
in 
the 
body 
of 
the 
army 
they 
did 
not 
ask 
themselves 
where
they 
were 
going 
or 
why. 
If 
they 
regretted 
having 
to 
retreat, 
it 
was 
only
because 
they 
had 
to 
leave 
billets 
they 
had 
grown 
accustomed 
to, 
or 
some
pretty 
young 
Polish 
lady. 
If 
the 
thought 
that 
things 
looked 
bad 
chanced
to 
enter 
anyone's 
head, 
he 
tried 
to 
be 
as 
cheerful 
as 
befits 
a 
good
soldier 
and 
not 
to 
think 
of 
the 
general 
trend 
of 
affairs, 
but 
only 
of
the 
task 
nearest 
to 
hand. 
First 
they 
camped 
gaily 
before 
Vilna, 
making
acquaintance 
with 
the 
Polish 
landowners, 
preparing 
for 
reviews 
and 
being
reviewed 
by 
the 
Emperor 
and 
other 
high 
commanders. 
Then 
came 
an 
order
to 
retreat 
to 
Sventsyani 
and 
destroy 
any 
provisions 
they 
could 
not 
carry
away 
with 
them. 
Sventsyani 
was 
remembered 
by 
the 
hussars 
only 
as 
the
drunken 
camp, 
a 
name 
the 
whole 
army 
gave 
to 
their 
encampment 
there,
and 
because 
many 
complaints 
were 
made 
against 
the 
troops, 
who, 
taking
advantage 
of 
the 
order 
to 
collect 
provisions, 
took 
also 
horses,
carriages, 
and 
carpets 
from 
the 
Polish 
proprietors. 
Rostov 
remembered
Sventsyani, 
because 
on 
the 
first 
day 
of 
their 
arrival 
at 
that 
small 
town
he 
changed 
his 
sergeant 
major 
and 
was 
unable 
to 
manage 
all 
the 
drunken
men 
of 
his 
squadron 
who, 
unknown 
to 
him, 
had 
appropriated 
five 
barrels
of 
old 
beer. 
From 
Sventsyani 
they 
retired 
farther 
and 
farther 
to 
Drissa,
and 
thence 
again 
beyond 
Drissa, 
drawing 
near 
to 
the 
frontier 
of 
Russia
proper.

On 
the 
thirteenth 
of 
July 
the 
Pavlograds 
took 
part 
in 
a 
serious 
action
for 
the 
first 
time.

On 
the 
twelfth 
of 
July, 
on 
the 
eve 
of 
that 
action, 
there 
was 
a 
heavy
storm 
of 
rain 
and 
hail. 
In 
general, 
the 
summer 
of 
1812 
was 
remarkable
for 
its 
storms.

The 
two 
Pavlograd 
squadrons 
were 
bivouacking 
on 
a 
field 
of 
rye, 
which
was 
already 
in 
ear 
but 
had 
been 
completely 
trodden 
down 
by 
cattle 
and
horses. 
The 
rain 
was 
descending 
in 
torrents, 
and 
Rostov, 
with 
a 
young
officer 
named 
Ilyin, 
his 
protege, 
was 
sitting 
in 
a 
hastily 
constructed
shelter. 
An 
officer 
of 
their 
regiment, 
with 
long 
mustaches 
extending
onto 
his 
cheeks, 
who 
after 
riding 
to 
the 
staff 
had 
been 
overtaken 
by 
the
rain, 
entered 
Rostov's 
shelter.

"I 
have 
come 
from 
the 
staff, 
Count. 
Have 
you 
heard 
of 
Raevski's
exploit?"

And 
the 
officer 
gave 
them 
details 
of 
the 
Saltanov 
battle, 
which 
he 
had
heard 
at 
the 
staff.

Rostov, 
smoking 
his 
pipe 
and 
turning 
his 
head 
about 
as<p>
the 
water
trickled 
down 
his 
neck, 
listened 
inattentively, 
with 
an 
occasional
glance 
at 
Ilyin, 
who 
was 
pressing 
close 
to 
him. 
This 
officer, 
a 
lad
of 
sixteen 
who 
had 
recently 
joined 
the 
regiment, 
was 
now 
in 
the 
same
relation 
to 
Nicholas 
that 
Nicholas 
had 
been 
to 
Denisov 
seven 
years
before. 
Ilyin 
tried 
to 
imitate 
Rostov 
in 
everything<p>
and 
adored 
him 
as 
a
girl 
might 
have 
done.

Zdrzhinski, 
the 
officer 
with 
the 
long 
mustache, 
spoke 
grandiloquently 
of
the 
Saltanov 
dam 
being 
"a 
Russian 
Thermopylae," 
and 
of 
how 
a 
deed 
worthy
of 
antiquity 
had 
been 
performed 
by 
General 
Raevski. 
He 
recounted 
how
Raevski 
had 
led 
his 
two 
sons 
onto 
the 
dam 
under 
terrific 
fire 
and 
had
charged 
with 
them 
beside 
him. 
Rostov 
heard 
the 
story 
and 
not 
only 
said
nothing 
to 
encourage 
Zdrzhinski's 
enthusiasm 
but, 
on 
the 
contrary,
looked 
like 
a 
man 
ashamed 
of 
what 
he 
was 
hearing, 
though 
with 
no
intention 
of 
contradicting 
it. 
Since 
the 
campaigns 
of 
Austerlitz 
and
of 
1807 
Rostov 
knew 
by 
experience 
that 
men 
always 
lie 
when 
describing
military 
exploits, 
as 
he 
himself 
had 
done 
when 
recounting 
them; 
besides
that, 
he 
had 
experience 
enough 
to 
know 
that 
nothing 
happens 
in 
war 
at
all 
as 
we 
can 
imagine 
or 
relate 
it. 
And 
so 
he 
did 
not 
like 
Zdrzhinski's
tale, 
nor 
did 
he 
like 
Zdrzhinski 
himself

CHAPTER 
III

The 
Russian 
army<p>
was 
commanded 
by 
Kutuzov 
and 
his 
staff, 
and 
also 
by 
the
Emperor 
from 
Petersburg. 
Before 
the 
news 
of 
the 
abandonment 
of 
Moscow
had 
been 
received 
in 
Petersburg, 
a 
detailed 
plan 
of 
the 
whole 
campaign
had 
been 
drawn 
up 
and 
sent<p>
to 
Kutuzov 
for 
his 
guidance. 
Though 
this 
plan
had 
been 
drawn 
up 
on 
the 
supposition 
that 
Moscow 
was 
still 
in 
our 
hands,
it 
was 
approved 
by 
the 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/YE3m8rP8GH.html">staff</a><p>
and 
accepted 
as 
a 
basis 
for 
action.
Kutuzov 
only 
replied 
that 
movements 
arranged 
from 
a 
distance 
were 
always
difficult 
to 
execute. 
So 
fresh 
instructions 
were 
sent 
for 
the 
solution
of 
difficulties 
that 
might 
be 
encountered, 
as 
well 
as 
fresh 
people 
who
were 
to 
watch 
Kutuzov's 
actions 
and 
report 
upon 
them.

Besides 
this, 
the 
whole 
staff 
of 
the 
Russian 
army 
was 
now 
reorganized.
The 
posts 
left 
vacant 
by 
Bagration, 
who 
had 
been 
killed, 
and 
by
Barclay, 
who 
had 
gone 
away 
in 
dudgeon, 
had 
to 
be 
filled. 
Very 
serious
consideration 
was 
given 
to 
the 
question 
whether 
it 
would 
be 
better 
to
put 
A 
in 
B's 
place 
and 
B 
in 
D's, 
or 
on 
the 
contrary 
to 
put 
D 
in 
A's
place, 
and 
so 
on-as 
if 
anything 
more 
<a href="/cZl/lx79pDix5pbE.html">than</a> 
A's 
or 
B's 
satisfaction
depended 
on 
this.

As 
a 
result 
of 
the 
hostility 
between 
Kutuzov 
and 
Bennigsen, 
his 
Chief 
of
Staff, 
the 
presence 
of 
confidential 
representatives 
of 
the 
Emperor, 
and
these 
transfers, 
a 
more 
than 
usually 
complicated 
play 
of 
parties
was 
going 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ew6HAJD7Nqwe1.html">on</a> 
among 
the 
staff 
of 
the 
army.<p>
A 
was 
undermining 
B, 
D 
was
undermining 
C, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Br2GaVr7Ta0.html">and</a> 
so 
on 
in 
all 
possible 
combinations 
and 
permutations.
In 
all 
these 
plottings 
the 
subject 
of 
intrigue 
was 
generally 
the 
conduct
of 
the 
war, 
which 
all 
these 
men 
believed 
they 
were 
directing; 
but 
this
affair 
of 
the 
war 
went 
on 
independently 
of 
them, 
as 
it 
had 
to 
go:
that 
is, 
never 
in 
the 
way 
people 
devised, 
but 
flowing 
always 
from 
the
essential 
attitude 
of 
the 
masses. 
Only 
in 
the 
highest 
spheres 
did
all 
these 
schemes, 
crossings, 
and 
interminglings 
appear 
to 
be 
a 
true
reflection 
of 
what 
had 
to 
happen.

Michael 
Ilarionovich!

intervention</h1>in
the 
business 
of 
packing 
was 
received 
skeptically. 
Everybody 
expected
some 
prank 
from 
her 
and 
did 
not 
wish 
to 
obey 
her; 
but 
she 
resolutely
and 
passionately 
demanded 
obedience, 
grew 
angry 
and 
nearly 
cried 
because
they 
did 
not 
heed 
her, 
and 
at 
last 
succeeded 
in 
making 
them 
believe 
her.
Her 
first 
exploit, 
which 
cost 
her 
immense 
effort 
and 
established 
her
authority, 
was 
the 
packing 
of 
the 
carpets. 
The 
count 
had 
valuable
Gobelin 
tapestries 
and 
Persian 
carpets 
in 
the 
house. 
When 
Natasha 
set
to 
work 
two 
cases 
were 
standing 
open 
in 
the 
ballroom, 
one 
almost 
full
up 
with 
crockery, 
the 
other 
with 
carpets. 
There 
was 
also 
much 
china
standing 
on 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vu6WlHf7HBo5cU.html">the</a> 
tables, 
and 
still 
more 
was 
being 
brought 
in 
from 
the
storeroom. 
A 
third 
case 
was 
needed 
and 
servants 
had 
gone 
to 
fetch 
it.

"Sonya, 
wait 
a 
bit-we'll 
pack 
everything 
into 
these," 
said 
Natasha.

"You<p>
can't, 
Miss, 
we 
have 
tried 
to," 
said 
the 
butler's 
assistant.

"No, 
wait 
a 
minute, 
please."

And 
Natasha 
began 
rapidly<p>
taking 
out 
of 
the 
case 
dishes 
and 
plates
wrapped 
in 
paper.

"The 
dishes 
must 
go 
in 
here 
among 
the 
carpets," 
said 
she.

"Why, 
it's 
a 
mercy 
if 
we 
can 
get 
the 
carpets 
alone 
into 
three 
cases,"
said 
the 
butler's 
assistant.

"Oh, 
wait, 
please!" 
And 
Natasha 
began 
rapidly 
and 
deftly 
sorting 
out 
the
things. 
"These 
aren't 
needed," 
said 
she, 
putting 
aside 
some 
plates
of 
Kiev 
ware. 
"These-yes, 
these 
must 
go 
among 
the 
carpets," 
she 
said,
referring 
to 
the 
Saxony 
china 
dishes.

"Don't, 
Natasha! 
Leave 
it 
alone! 
We'll 
get 
it 
all<p>
packed," 
urged 
Sonya
reproachfully.

"What 
a 
young 
lady 
she 
is!" 
remarked 
the 
major-domo.

But 
Natasha 
would 
not 
give 
in. 
She 
turned 
everything 
out 
and 
began
quickly 
repacking, 
deciding 
that 
the 
inferior 
Russian 
carpets 
and
unnecessary 
crockery 
should 
not 
be 
taken 
at 
all. 
When 
everything 
had
been 
taken<p>
out 
of 
the 
cases, 
they 
recommenced 
packing, 
and 
it 
turned
out 
that 
when 
the 
cheaper 
things 
not<p>
worth 
taking 
had 
nearly 
all 
been
rejected, 
the 
valuable 
ones 
<a href="/cZl/EG8eplAZ2hai3.html">really</a> 
did<p>
all 
go<p>
into 
the 
two 
cases. 
Only
the<p>
lid 
of 
the 
case 
containing 
the<p>
carpets 
would 
not 
shut 
down. 
A 
few
more 
things 
might 
have 
been 
taken 
out, 
but 
Natasha 
insisted 
on 
having
her 
own 
<a href="/cZl/AX7CiG5ioN4DLq.html">way.</a> 
She 
packed, 
repacked, 
pressed, 
made 
the 
butler's 
assistant
and 
Petya-whom 
she 
had 
drawn 
into 
the 
business 
of 
packing-press 
on 
the
lid, 
and 
made 
desperate 
efforts 
herself.

"That's 
enough, 
Natasha," 
said 
Sonya. 
"I 
see 
you 
were 
right, 
but 
just
take 
out 
the 
top 
one."

"I 
won't!" 
cried 
Natasha, 
with 
one 
hand 
holding 
back 
the<p>
hair 
that 
hung
over 
her 
perspiring 
face, 
while 
with 
the 
other 
she 
pressed 
down 
the
carpets.<p>
"Now 
press, 
Petya! 
Press, 
Vasilich, 
press 
hard!" 
she 
cried.

The 
carpets 
yielded 
and 
the 
lid 
closed; 
Natasha, 
clapping 
her 
hands,
screamed 
with 
delight 
and 
tears 
fell 
from 
her 
eyes. 
But 
this 
only
lasted 
a 
moment. 
She 
at 
once 
set 
to 
work 
afresh 
and 
they 
now 
trusted 
her
completely. 
The 
count 
was 
not 
angry 
even 
when 
they 
told 
him 
that 
Natasha
had 
countermanded 
an 
order 
of 
his, 
and 
the 
servants 
now 
came 
to 
her
to 
ask 
whether 
a 
cart 
was 
sufficiently 
loaded, 
and 
whether 
it 
might
be 
corded 
up. 
Thanks 
to 
Natasha's 
directions 
the 
work 
now 
went 
on
expeditiously, 
unnecessary 
things 
were 
left, 
and 
the 
most 
valuable
packed 
as 
compactly 
as 
possible.

But 
hard 
as 
they 
all 
worked 
till 
quite 
late 
that 
night, 
they 
could 
not
get 
everything 
packed. 
The 
countess 
had 
fallen 
asleep 
and 
the 
count,
having 
put 
off 
their 
departure 
till 
next 
morning, 
went 
to 
bed.

A

one 
of 
the

the

stern 
face. 
The 
length 
of 
her
body 
was 
strikingly 
out

to 
her 
short 
legs. 
Prince 
Vasili

to 
her.

"Well,

"Still

"Ah,

Mary<p>
for 
Prince 
Andrew's 
letter 
which 
had 
been 
forgotten 
in<p>
the 
drawing
room. 
She 
gave 
it 
to 
him 
and, 
unpleasant 
as 
it 
was 
to 
her 
to 
do 
so,
ventured 
to 
ask 
him 
what 
her 
father 
was 
doing.

"Always 
busy," 
replied 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
with 
a 
respectfully 
ironic
smile 
which 
caused 
Princess 
Mary 
to 
turn 
pale. 
"He's 
worrying 
very 
much
about 
the 
new 
building. 
He 
has 
been 
reading 
a 
little, 
but 
now"-Michael
Ivanovich 
went 
<a href="/cZl/omA43bOIDr7tjjJI.html">on,</a> 
lowering 
his 
voice-"now 
he's 
at 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Ta46MdWa0SwJMI.html">desk,</a> 
busy 
with
his 
will, 
I 
expect." 
(One 
of 
the 
prince's 
favorite 
occupations 
of 
late
had 
been 
the 
preparation 
of 
some 
papers 
he 
meant 
to 
leave 
at 
his 
death
and 
which 
he 
called 
his 
"will.")

"And 
Alpatych 
is 
being 
sent 
to 
Smolensk?" 
asked 
Princess 
<a href="/aVzUge/td26W1kQqNG.html">Mary.

"Oh,</a> 
yes,

has 
been 
waiting

CHAPTER 
III

When 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
returned 
to 
the 
study 
with 
the 
letter, 
the 
old
prince, 
with 
spectacles 
on<p>
and 
a 
shade 
over 
his 
eyes, 
was 
sitting 
at 
his
open 
bureau 
with 
screened 
candles, 
holding 
a 
paper 
in 
his 
outstretched
hand, 
and 
in 
a 
somewhat 
dramatic 
attitude 
was 
reading 
his 
manuscript-his
"Remarks" 
as 
he 
termed 
it-which 
was 
to 
be 
transmitted 
to 
the 
Emperor
after 
his 
death.

When 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
went 
in 
there 
were 
tears 
in 
the 
prince's 
eyes
evoked 
by 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
time 
when 
the 
paper 
he 
was 
now 
reading 
had
been 
written. 
He 
took 
the 
letter 
from 
Michael 
Ivanovich's 
hand, 
put 
it
in 
his 
pocket, 
folded 
up 
his 
papers, 
and 
called 
in 
Alpatych 
who 
had 
long
been 
waiting.

The 
prince 
had 
a 
list 
of 
things 
to 
be 
bought 
in 
Smolensk 
and, 
walking
up 
and 
down 
the 
room 
past 
Alpatych 
who 
stood 
by 
the 
door, 
he 
gave 
his
instructions.

"First,

you

Eight

reminded</h1>Pierre 
that 
it 
was 
Sunday 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/Apv3b9HBo0PUEsy.html">the</a> 
feast 
of 
the
Nativity 
of 
the 
Virgin. 
But 
there 
<a href="/cZl/xN150Ptam.html">seemed</a> 
to 
be 
no 
one 
to 
celebrate 
this
holiday: 
everywhere 
were 
blackened 
ruins, 
and 
the 
few 
Russians 
to 
be
seen 
were 
tattered 
and 
frightened 
people 
<a href="/cZl/Sj2GLY4PdQ.html">who</a> 
tried 
to 
hide 
when 
they 
saw
the 
French.

It 
was 
plain 
that 
the 
Russian 
nest 
was 
ruined 
and 
destroyed, 
but 
in
place 
of 
the 
Russian 
order 
of 
life 
that 
had 
been 
destroyed, 
Pierre
unconsciously 
felt 
that 
a 
quite 
different, 
firm, 
French 
order 
had 
been
established 
over 
this 
ruined 
nest. 
He 
felt 
this 
in 
the 
looks 
of
the 
soldiers 
who, 
marching 
in 
regular 
ranks 
briskly 
and 
gaily, 
were
escorting 
him 
and 
the 
other 
criminals; 
he 
felt 
it 
in 
the 
looks 
of 
an
important 
French 
official 
in 
a 
carriage 
and 
pair 
driven 
by 
a 
soldier,
whom 
they 
met 
on 
the 
way. 
He 
felt 
it 
in 
the 
merry 
sounds 
of 
regimental
music 
he 
heard 
from 
the 
left 
side 
of 
the 
field, 
and 
felt 
and 
realized
it 
especially 
from 
the 
list 
of 
prisoners 
the 
French 
officer 
had 
read 
out
when 
he 
came 
that 
morning. 
Pierre 
had 
been 
taken 
by 
one 
set 
of 
soldiers
and 
led 
first 
to 
one 
and 
then 
to 
another 
place 
with 
dozens 
of 
other 
men,
and 
it 
seemed 
that 
they 
might 
have 
forgotten 
him, 
or 
confused 
him 
with
the 
others. 
But 
no: 
the 
answers 
he 
had 
given 
when 
questioned 
had 
come
back 
to 
him 
in 
his 
designation 
as 
"the 
man 
who 
does 
not 
give 
his 
name,"
and 
under 
that 
appellation, 
which 
to 
Pierre 
seemed 
terrible, 
they 
were
now 
leading 
him 
somewhere 
with 
unhesitating 
assurance 
on 
their 
faces
that 
he 
and 
all 
the 
other 
prisoners 
were 
exactly 
the 
ones 
they 
wanted
and 
that 
they 
were 
being 
taken<p>
to 
the 
proper 
place. 
Pierre 
felt 
himself
to 
be 
an 
insignificant 
chip 
fallen 
among 
the 
wheels 
of 
a 
machine 
whose
action 
he 
did 
not 
understand 
but 
which 
was 
working 
well.

He 
and 
the 
other 
prisoners 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
right 
side 
of 
the 
Virgin's
Field, 
to 
a 
large 
white 
house 
with 
an 
immense 
garden 
not 
far 
from 
the
convent. 
This 
was 
Prince 
Shcherbatov's 
house, 
where 
Pierre 
had 
often
been 
in 
other 
days, 
and 
which, 
as 
he<p>
learned 
from 
the 
talk 
of 
the
soldiers, 
was 
now 
occupied 
by 
the 
marshal, 
the 
Duke 
of 
Eckmuehl 
(Davout).

They 
were 
taken 
to 
the 
entrance 
and 
led 
into 
the 
house 
one 
by 
one.
Pierre 
was 
the 
sixth 
to 
enter. 
He 
was 
conducted 
through 
a 
glass 
gallery,
an 
anteroom, 
and 
a 
hall, 
which 
were 
familiar 
to 
him, 
into 
a 
long 
low
study 
at 
the 
door 
of 
which 
stood 
an 
adjutant.

Davout, 
spectacles 
on 
nose, 
sat 
bent 
over 
a 
table 
at 
the 
further 
end 
of
the 
room. 
Pierre 
went 
close 
up 
to 
him, 
but 
Davout, 
evidently 
consulting
a 
paper 
that 
lay 
before 
him, 
did 
not 
look 
up. 
Without 
raising 
his 
eyes,
he 
said 
in 
a 
low 
voice:

"Who 
are 
you?"

Pierre 
was 
silent 
because 
he 
was 
incapable 
of 
uttering 
a 
word. 
To 
him
Davout 
was 
not 
merely 
a 
French 
general, 
but 
a 
man 
notorious 
for 
his
cruelty. 
Looking 
at 
his 
cold 
face, 
as 
he 
sat 
like 
a 
stern 
schoolmaster
who 
was 
prepared 
to 
wait 
awhile 
for 
an 
answer, 
Pierre 
felt 
that 
every
instant 
of 
delay 
might 
cost 
him 
his 
life; 
but 
he 
did 
not 
know 
what
to 
say. 
He 
did 
not 
venture 
to 
repeat 
what 
he 
had 
said 
at 
his 
first
examination, 
yet 
to 
disclose

manner:

evidently

of 
Pierre's 
noble

He

him

Anatole's. 
"First,

at

biting 
his

"After

with 
a
questioning

Anatole, 
growing 
more 
confident 
as
Pierre 
mastered 
his 
wrath. 
"I 
don't

don't

he
said, 
not 
looking 
at 
Pierre

with 
a 
slight 
tremor 
of 
his 
lower 
jaw,
"but 
you

me-'mean' 
and 
so 
on-which 
as 
a

honor 
I 
can't

Pierre 
glanced 
at 
him 
with 
amazement, 
unable 
to 
understand 
what 
he
wanted.

"Though 
it 
was 
tete-a-tete," 
Anatole 
continued,

in 
a 
clear 
strip 
of 
sky 
beneath 
the 
clouds,
the

<a href="/aVzUge/nI91hOZs9om.html">fell,</a>

on

disappeared
behind 
a 
long

cloud 
that 
hung

A

minutes 
later 
it
reappeared 
brighter 
still 
from 
behind 
the 
top 
of 
the 
cloud, 
tearing 
its
edge. 
Everything 
grew 
bright 
and 
glittered. 
And 
with 
that 
light, 
and 
as
if 
in 
reply 
to 
it, 
came 
the 
sound 
of 
guns 
ahead 
of 
them.

Before 
Rostov 
<a href="/cZl/XH6HV6It6R.html">had</a> 
had 
time 
to 
consider 
and 
determine 
the 
distance 
of
that 
firing, 
Count 
Ostermann-Tolstoy's 
adjutant 
came 
galloping 
from
Vitebsk 
with 
orders 
to 
advance 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
road.

The 
squadron 
overtook 
and 
passed 
the 
infantry 
and 
the 
battery-which 
had
also 
quickened 
their 
pace-rode 
down 
a 
hill,<p>
and 
passing<p>
through 
an 
empty
and 
deserted 
village 
again 
ascended. 
The 
horses 
began 
to 
lather 
and 
the
men 
to 
flush.

"Halt! 
Dress 
your 
ranks!" 
the 
order 
of 
the<p>
regimental 
commander 
was
heard 
ahead. 
"Forward 
by 
the 
left. 
Walk, 
march!" 
came 
the 
order 
from 
in
front.

And 
the 
hussars, 
passing 
along 
the 
line 
of 
troops 
on 
the 
left 
flank 
of
our 
position, 
halted 
behind 
our 
Uhlans 
who 
were 
in 
the 
front 
line. 
To
the<p>
right 
stood 
our 
infantry 
in 
a 
dense 
column: 
they 
were 
the 
reserve.
Higher 
up 
the 
hill, 
on 
the 
very 
horizon, 
our 
guns 
were 
visible 
through
the 
wonderfully 
clear 
air, 
brightly 
illuminated 
by 
slanting 
morning
sunbeams. 
In 
front, 
beyond 
a 
hollow 
dale, 
could 
be 
seen 
the 
enemy's
columns 
and 
guns. 
Our 
advanced 
line, 
already 
in 
action, 
could 
be 
heard
briskly 
exchanging 
shots 
with 
the 
enemy 
in 
the 
dale.

At 
these 
sounds, 
long 
<a href="/cZl/bER4STxex0Xjv5qrwB.html">unheard,</a> 
Rostov's 
spirits 
rose, 
as 
at 
the 
strains
of 
the 
merriest 
music. 
Trap-ta-ta-tap! 
cracked 
the 
shots, 
now 
together,
now 
several 
quickly 
one 
after 
another. 
Again 
all 
was<p>
silent 
and 
then
again 
it 
sounded 
as 
if 
someone 
were 
walking 
on 
detonators 
and 
exploding
them.

The 
hussars 
remained 
in 
the 
same 
place 
for 
about 
an 
hour. 
A 
cannonade
began. 
Count 
Ostermann 
with 
his 
suite 
rode 
up 
behind 
the 
squadron,
halted, 
spoke 
to 
the 
commander 
of 
the 
regiment, 
and 
rode 
up 
the 
hill 
to
the 
guns.

After 
Ostermann 
had 
gone, 
a 
command 
rang 
out 
to 
the 
Uhlans.

So 
he 
rattled 
on, 
telling 
all 
the 
gossip 
he 
had 
heard 
among 
the
orderlies. 
Much 
of 
it 
true. 
But 
when 
Napoleon 
asked<p>
him 
whether<p>
the
Russians 
thought 
they 
would 
beat 
Bonaparte 
or 
not, 
Lavrushka 
screwed 
up
his 
eyes 
and 
considered.

In 
this 
question 
he 
saw 
subtle 
cunning, 
as 
men 
of 
his 
type 
see 
cunning
in 
everything, 
so 
he 
frowned 
and 
did 
not 
answer 
immediately.

"It's 
like 
this," 
he 
said 
thoughtfully, 
"if 
there's 
a 
battle 
soon, 
yours
will 
win. 
That's 
right. 
But 
if 
three 
days 
pass, 
then 
after 
that, 
well,
then 
that 
same 
battle 
will 
not 
soon 
be 
over."

Lelorgne 
d'Ideville 
smilingly 
interpreted 
this 
speech 
to 
Napoleon 
thus:
"If 
a 
battle 
takes 
place 
within 
the 
next 
three<p>
days 
the 
French 
will
win, 
but 
if 
later, 
God 
knows 
what 
will 
happen." 
Napoleon 
did 
not 
smile,
though 
he 
was 
evidently 
in 
high 
good 
humor, 
and 
he 
ordered 
these 
words
to 
be 
repeated.

Lavrushka 
noticed 
this 
and 
to 
entertain 
him 
further, 
pretending 
not 
to
know 
who 
Napoleon 
was, 
added:

"We 
know 
that 
you 
have 
Bonaparte 
and 
that 
he 
has 
beaten 
everybody 
in 
the
world, 
but 
we 
are 
a 
different 
matter..."-without 
knowing 
why 
or 
how 
this
bit 
of 
boastful 
patriotism 
slipped 
out 
at 
the 
end.

The 
interpreter 
translated 
these 
words 
without 
the 
last 
<a href="/cZl/tc112i.html">phrase,</a> 
and
Bonaparte 
smiled. 
"The 
young 
Cossack 
made 
his 
mighty 
interlocutor
smile," 
says 
Thiers. 
After 
riding 
a 
few 
paces 
in 
silence, 
Napoleon
turned 
to 
Berthier 
and 
said 
he 
wished 
to 
see 
how 
the 
news 
that 
he 
was
talking 
to 
the 
Emperor 
himself, 
to 
that 
very 
Emperor 
who 
had 
written 
his
immortally 
victorious 
name 
on 
the 
Pyramids, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/dK2oGGl5ODiFp7xt.html">would</a> 
affect 
this 
enfant 
du
Don. 
*

 
 
 
 
* 
"Child 
of 
the 
Don."


The 
fact 
was 
accordingly 
conveyed 
to 
Lavrushka.

Lavrushka, 
understanding 
that 
this 
was 
done 
to 
perplex 
him 
and 
that
Napoleon 
expected 
him 
to 
be 
frightened, 
to 
gratify 
his 
new 
masters
promptly 
pretended 
to 
be 
astonished 
and 
awe-struck, 
opened 
his 
eyes
wide, 
and 
assumed 
the 
expression 
he 
usually 
put 
on 
when 
taken 
to<p>
be
whipped. 
"As 
soon 
as 
Napoleon's 
interpreter<p>
had 
spoken," 
says 
Thiers,
"the 
Cossack, 
seized 
by 
amazement,

then 
joined 
the

"Well,

"Yes,

Mikhaylovna

her 
son 
as
Countess 
Rostova's 
carriage 
in 
which 
they 
were 
seated 
drove 
over 
the
straw 
covered 
street 
and 
turned 
into 
the 
wide 
courtyard 
of 
Count 
Cyril
Vladimirovich 
Bezukhov's 
house. 
"My 
dear 
Boris," 
said 
the
mother, 
drawing 
her 
hand 
from 
beneath 
her 
old 
mantle 
and 
laying
it 
timidly 
and 
tenderly 
on 
her 
son's 
arm, 
"be 
affectionate 
and
attentive 
to 
him. 
Count 
Cyril 
Vladimirovich 
is 
your 
godfather 
after
all, 
and 
your 
future 
depends 
on 
him. 
Remember 
that, 
my 
dear, 
and 
be 
nice
to 
him, 
as 
you 
so 
well 
know 
how 
to 
be."

"If 
only 
I 
knew 
that 
anything 
besides 
humiliation 
would 
come 
of
it..." 
answered 
her 
son 
coldly. 
"But 
I 
have 
promised 
and 
will 
do 
it
for 
your 
sake."

Although 
the 
hall 
porter 
saw 
someone's 
carriage 
standing 
at 
the
entrance, 
after 
scrutinizing 
the 
mother 
and 
son 
(who 
without 
asking 
to
be 
announced 
had 
passed 
straight 
through 
the 
glass 
porch 
between 
the
rows 
of 
statues 
in 
niches) 
and 
looking 
significantly 
at 
the 
lady's 
old
cloak, 
he 
asked 
whether 
they 
wanted 
the 
count 
or 
the 
princesses, 
and,
hearing 
that 
they 
wished 
to 
see

count, 
said

today, 
and 
that 
his 
excellency 
was 
not 
receiving 
anyone.

"We 
may

back," 
said 
the 
son 
in 
French.

"My

exclaimed

in

I 
am 
afraid

him," 
he 
thought, 
and 
again 
he 
felt 
something 
terrible 
and 
monstrous
rising 
in 
his 
soul. 
Dolokhov, 
Denisov, 
and 
Rostov 
were 
now 
sitting
opposite 
Pierre 
and 
seemed 
very 
gay. 
Rostov 
was 
talking 
merrily 
to 
his
two 
friends, 
one 
of 
whom 
was 
a 
dashing 
hussar 
and 
the 
other 
a 
notorious
duelist 
and 
rake, 
and 
every 
now 
and 
then 
he 
glanced 
ironically 
at
Pierre, 
whose 
preoccupied, 
absent-minded, 
and 
massive 
figure 
was 
a 
very
noticeable 
one 
at 
the 
dinner. 
Rostov 
looked 
<a href="/cZl/NP2D1vf5ezc.html">inimically</a> 
at 
Pierre,
first 
because 
Pierre 
appeared 
to 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/zD34lOZ0.html">his</a> 
hussar 
eyes 
as 
a 
rich 
civilian, 
the
husband 
of 
a 
beauty, 
and 
in 
a 
word-an 
old 
woman; 
and 
secondly 
because
Pierre 
in 
his 
preoccupation 
and 
absent-mindedness 
had 
not 
recognized
Rostov 
and 
had 
not 
responded 
to 
his 
greeting. 
When 
the 
Emperor's
health 
was 
drunk, 
Pierre, 
lost 
in 
thought, 
did 
not 
rise 
or 
lift 
his
glass.

"What 
are 
you 
about?" 
shouted<p>
Rostov, 
looking 
at 
him 
in 
an 
ecstasy
of 
exasperation. 
"Don't 
you 
hear 
it's 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor's
health?"

Pierre 
sighed, 
rose 
submissively, 
emptied 
his 
glass, 
and, 
waiting 
till
all 
were 
seated 
again, 
turned 
with 
his 
kindly 
smile 
to 
Rostov.

"Why, 
I 
didn't 
recognize 
you!" 
he 
said. 
But 
Rostov 
was 
otherwise
engaged; 
he 
was 
shouting 
"Hurrah!"

"Why 
don't 
you 
renew 
the 
acquaintance?" 
said 
Dolokhov 
to 
Rostov.

"Confound 
him, 
he's 
a 
fool!" 
said 
Rostov.

"One 
should<p>
make 
up 
to 
the 
husbands 
of 
pretty 
women," 
said 
Denisov.

Pierre 
did 
not 
catch 
what 
they 
were 
saying, 
but 
knew 
they 
were 
talking
about 
him. 
He 
reddened 
and 
<a href="/cZl/Xo8fnBp1EPTad8Cr.html">turned</a> 
away.

"Well, 
now

the

All 
this 
time 
Natasha 
sat 
silent, 
glancing 
up 
at 
him 
from 
under 
her
brows. 
This 
gaze 
disturbed 
and 
confused 
Boris 
more 
and 
more. 
He 
looked
round 
more 
frequently 
toward 
her, 
and 
broke 
off 
in 
what 
he 
was 
saying.
He 
did 
not

more 
than 
ten 
minutes, 
then 
rose 
and 
took 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/gv8sCi8PFi5qB.html">his</a> 
leave. 
The
same 
inquisitive, 
challenging, 
and 
rather 
mocking 
eyes 
still 
looked
at 
him. 
After 
his 
first 
visit 
Boris 
said 
to 
himself 
that 
Natasha
attracted 
him 
just 
as 
much 
as 
ever, 
but 
that 
he 
must 
not 
yield 
to 
that
feeling, 
because 
to 
marry 
her, 
a 
girl 
almost 
without 
fortune, 
would
mean 
ruin 
to 
his 
career, 
while 
to 
renew 
their 
former 
relations 
without
intending 
to 
marry 
her 
would 
be<p>
dishonorable. 
Boris 
made 
up 
his 
mind
to 
avoid 
meeting 
Natasha, 
but 
despite 
that 
resolution 
he 
called 
again
a 
few 
days 
later 
and 
began 
calling 
often 
and 
spending 
whole 
days 
at 
the
Rostovs'. 
It 
seemed 
to 
him 
that 
he 
ought 
to 
have 
an 
explanation 
with
Natasha 
and 
tell 
her 
that 
the 
old 
times 
must 
be 
forgotten, 
that 
in
spite 
of 
everything... 
she 
could 
not 
be 
his 
wife, 
that 
he 
had 
no 
means,
and 
they 
would 
never 
let 
her 
marry 
him. 
But 
he 
failed 
to 
do 
so 
and 
felt
awkward 
about 
entering 
on 
such 
an 
explanation.<p>
From 
day 
to 
day 
he
became 
more 
and 
more 
entangled. 
It 
seemed 
to 
her 
mother 
and 
Sonya 
that
Natasha 
was 
in 
love 
with 
Boris 
as 
of 
old. 
She 
sang 
him 
his 
favorite
songs, 
showed 
him 
her

any

must 
be

senseless-was 
the 
very 
time 
to 
fight 
and

Kutuzov 
merely

his 
shoulders 
when 
one 
after
another 
they 
presented 
projects 
of 
maneuvers 
to 
be

with 
those
soldiers-ill-shod, 
insufficiently 
clad, 
and 
half 
starved-who 
within 
a
month 
and 
without 
fighting 
a

had 
dwindled 
to 
half

and 
who 
at 
the

the

have 
to 
go 
a 
greater
distance 
than 
they 
had 
already 
traversed, 
before 
they 
reached 
the
frontier.

This 
longing 
to 
distinguish 
themselves, 
to 
maneuver, 
to 
overthrow, 
and
to 
cut 
off 
showed 
itself 
particularly 
whenever 
the 
Russians 
stumbled 
on
the 
French 
army.

So 
it 
was 
at 
Krasnoe, 
where 
they 
expected 
to 
find 
one 
of 
the 
three
French 
columns 
and 
stumbled 
instead 
on 
Napoleon 
himself 
with 
sixteen
thousand 
men. 
Despite

Kutuzov's

avoid

"The

And 
as 
usual 
nothing 
happened 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
disposition.
Prince 
Eugene 
of 
Wuerttemberg<p>
fired

over 
the 
French 
crowds
that 
were 
running 
past, 
and 
demanded 
reinforcements 
which 
did 
not
arrive. 
The 
French, 
avoiding 
the 
Russians, 
dispersed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Kt1fqZYy6E2U.html">and</a> 
hid 
themselves
in 
the 
forest 
by 
night, 
making 
their 
way 
round 
as 
best 
they 
could, 
and
continued 
their 
flight.

up 
to

pointing

And 
the 
cavalry, 
with 
spurs

urging 
on 
horses 
that 
could
scarcely

trotted 
with 
much<p>

the

them-that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
a 
crowd 
of 
Frenchmen 
stark 
with

the

that 
had 
been 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jJ2zWn6AF9mbEd.html">presented</a>

them 
threw 
down 
its

surrendered 
as 
it 
had 
long 
been 
anxious<p>
to
do.

At

twenty-six

several

cannon, 
and 
a 
stick 
called

disputed

who
had

were 
pleased 
with 
their 
achievement-though
they 
much 
regretted 
not 
having 
taken 
Napoleon, 
or 
at 
least 
a 
marshal 
or
a 
hero 
of 
some 
sort, 
and 
reproached 
one 
another 
and 
especially 
Kutuzov
for 
having 
failed<p>
to 
do 
so.

These 
men, 
carried 
away 
by 
their

were 
but 
blind 
tools 
of 
the
most 
melancholy

the 
very

he 
had

The

who 
was

night, 
bled 
him

said 
that 
the

had 
had 
a<p>
seizure 
paralyzing 
his 
right 
side.

It 
was 
becoming 
more 
and 
more 
dangerous 
to 
remain 
at 
Bald 
Hills, 
and
next 
day 
they 
moved 
the 
prince 
to 
Bogucharovo, 
the 
doctor 
accompanying
him.

By 
the 
time 
they 
reached 
Bogucharovo, 
Dessalles 
and 
the 
little 
prince
had 
already 
left 
for 
Moscow.

For 
three 
weeks 
the 
old 
prince 
lay 
stricken 
by 
paralysis 
in 
the 
new
house 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
built 
at 
Bogucharovo, 
ever 
in 
the 
same 
state,
getting 
neither 
better 
nor 
worse. 
He 
was 
unconscious 
and 
lay 
like
a 
distorted 
corpse. 
He 
muttered 
unceasingly, 
his 
eyebrows 
and 
lips
twitching, 
and 
it 
was 
impossible 
to 
tell 
whether 
he 
understood 
what 
was
going 
on 
around 
him 
or 
not. 
One 
thing 
was 
certain-that 
he 
was 
suffering
and 
wished 
to 
say 
something. 
But 
what 
it 
was, 
no 
one 
could 
tell: 
it
might 
be 
some 
caprice 
of 
a 
sick 
and 
half-crazy 
man, 
or 
it 
might 
relate
to 
public 
affairs, 
or 
possibly 
to 
family 
concerns.

The 
doctor 
said 
this 
restlessness 
did 
not 
mean 
anything 
and 
was 
due
to 
physical 
causes; 
but 
Princess 
Mary 
thought 
he 
wished 
to 
tell
her 
something, 
and 
the 
fact 
that 
her 
presence 
always 
increased 
his
restlessness 
confirmed 
her 
opinion.

He 
was 
evidently 
suffering 
both 
physically 
and 
mentally. 
There 
was 
no
hope 
of 
recovery. 
It 
was 
impossible 
for 
him 
to 
travel, 
it 
would 
not 
do
to 
let 
him 
die 
on 
the 
road. 
"Would 
it

better 
if 
the

did

she 
watched 
him 
and, 
terrible 
to 
say, 
often 
watched
him 
not 
with 
hope 
of 
finding 
signs 
of 
improvement 
but 
wishing 
to 
find
symptoms 
of 
the 
approach 
of 
the 
end.

Strange 
as 
it 
was 
to 
her 
to 
acknowledge 
this 
feeling 
in 
herself, 
yet
there 
it 
was. 
And 
what 
seemed 
still 
more 
terrible 
to 
her 
was 
that 
since
her 
father's 
illness 
began 
(perhaps 
even 
sooner, 
when 
she 
stayed 
with
him 
expecting 
something 
to 
happen), 
all 
the 
personal 
desires 
and 
hopes
that 
had 
been 
forgotten 
or 
sleeping 
within 
her 
had 
awakened. 
Thoughts
that 
had 
not 
entered 
her 
mind 
for 
years-thoughts 
of 
a 
life 
free 
from
the 
fear 
of 
her 
father, 
and 
even 
the 
possibility 
of 
love 
and 
of 
family
happiness-floated 
continually 
in 
her 
imagination 
like 
temptations 
of 
the
devil. 
Thrust 
them 
aside 
as 
she 
would, 
questions 
continually 
recurred
to 
her 
as 
to 
how 
she 
would 
order 
her 
life 
now, 
after 
that. 
These 
were
temptations 
of 
the 
devil 
and 
Princess 
Mary 
knew 
it. 
She 
knew 
that 
the
sole 
weapon 
against 
him 
was 
prayer, 
and 
she 
tried 
to 
pray. 
She 
assumed
an 
attitude 
of 
prayer, 
looked 
at 
the 
icons, 
repeated 
the 
words 
of 
a
prayer, 
but 
she 
could 
not 
pray. 
She 
felt 
that 
a 
different 
world 
had
now 
taken 
possession 
of 
her-the 
life 
of 
a 
world 
of 
strenuous 
and 
free
activity, 
quite 
opposed 
to 
the 
spiritual 
world 
in 
which 
till 
now 
she
had 
been 
confined 
and 
in 
which 
her 
greatest 
comfort 
had 
been 
prayer.
She 
could 
not 
pray, 
could 
not 
weep, 
and 
worldly 
cares 
took 
possession 
of
her.

It 
was 
becoming 
dangerous 
to 
remain 
in 
Bogucharovo. 
News 
of 
the 
approach
of 
the 
French 
came 
from 
all 
sides, 
and 
in 
one 
village, 
ten 
miles 
from
Bogucharovo, 
a 
homestead 
had 
been 
looted 
by 
French 
marauders.

The 
doctor 
insisted 
on 
the 
necessity 
of 
moving 
the 
prince; 
the
provincial 
Marshal 
of 
the 
Nobility 
sent 
an 
official 
to 
Princess 
Mary
to 
persuade 
her 
to 
get 
away 
as 
quickly 
as 
possible, 
and 
the 
head 
of 
the
rural 
police 
having 
come 
to 
Bogucharovo 
urged 
the 
same 
thing, 
saying
that 
the 
French 
were 
only 
some 
twenty-five 
miles 
away, 
that 
French
proclamations 
were 
circulating 
in 
the 
villages, 
and 
that 
if 
the 
princess
did 
not 
take 
her 
father 
away 
before 
the 
fifteenth, 
he 
could 
not 
answer
for 
the 
consequences.

The 
princess 
decided 
to 
leave 
on 
the 
fifteenth.

and 
groans 
hurried 
on, 
still 
entangled 
in
the 
crowds 
of 
soldiers.

The 
one 
thing 
he 
now 
desired 
with 
his 
whole 
soul 
was 
to 
get 
away 
quickly
from 
the 
terrible 
sensations 
amid 
which 
he 
had 
lived 
that 
day 
and 
return
to 
ordinary 
conditions 
of 
life 
and 
sleep 
quietly 
in 
a 
room 
in 
his 
own
bed. 
He 
felt 
that 
only 
in 
the 
ordinary 
conditions 
of 
life 
would 
he
be 
able 
to 
understand 
himself 
and 
all 
he 
had 
seen 
and 
felt. 
But 
such
ordinary 
conditions 
of 
life 
were 
nowhere 
to 
be 
found.

Though 
shells 
and 
bullets 
did 
not 
whistle 
over 
the 
road 
along 
which 
he
was 
going, 
still 
on 
all 
sides 
there 
was 
what 
there 
had 
been 
on 
the 
field
of 
battle. 
There 
were 
still 
the 
same 
suffering, 
exhausted, 
and 
sometimes
strangely 
indifferent 
faces, 
the 
same 
blood, 
the 
same 
soldiers'
overcoats, 
the 
same 
sounds 
of 
firing 
which, 
though 
distant 
now, 
still
aroused 
terror, 
and 
besides 
this 
there 
were 
the 
foul 
air 
and 
the 
dust.

Having 
gone 
a 
couple 
of 
miles 
along 
the<p>
Mozhaysk 
road, 
Pierre 
sat 
down
by 
the 
roadside.

Dusk 
had 
fallen, 
and 
the 
roar 
of 
guns 
died 
away. 
Pierre 
lay 
leaning 
on
his 
elbow 
for 
a 
long 
time, 
gazing 
at 
the 
shadows 
that 
moved 
past 
him 
in
the 
darkness. 
He 
was 
continually 
imagining 
that 
a 
cannon 
ball 
was 
flying
toward 
him 
with 
a 
terrific 
whizz, 
and 
then 
he 
shuddered 
and 
sat 
up. 
He
had 
no 
idea 
how 
long 
he 
had 
been 
there. 
In 
the 
middle 
of 
the 
night 
three
soldiers, 
having 
brought 
some 
firewood, 
settled 
down 
near 
him 
and 
began
lighting 
a 
fire.

The 
soldiers, 
who 
threw 
sidelong 
glances 
at 
Pierre, 
got 
the 
fire 
to 
burn
and 
placed 
an 
iron 
pot 
on 
it 
into 
which 
they 
broke 
some 
dried 
bread 
and
put 
a 
little 
dripping. 
The 
pleasant 
odor 
of 
greasy 
viands 
mingled 
with
the 
smell 
of 
smoke. 
Pierre 
sat 
up 
and 
sighed. 
The 
three 
soldiers 
were
eating 
and 
talking 
among 
themselves, 
taking 
no 
notice 
of 
him.

"And 
who 
may 
you 
be?" 
one 
of 
them 
suddenly 
asked 
Pierre, 
evidently
meaning 
what 
Pierre 
himself 
had 
in 
mind, 
namely: 
"If 
you 
want 
to 
eat
we'll 
give 
you 
some 
food, 
only 
let 
us 
know 
whether 
you 
are 
an 
honest
man."

"I, 
I..." 
said 
Pierre, 
feeling 
it 
necessary 
to 
minimize 
his 
social
position 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
so 
as 
to 
be 
nearer 
to 
the 
soldiers 
and
better 
understood 
by 
them. 
"By 
rights 
I 
am 
a 
militia 
officer, 
but 
my 
men
are 
not 
here. 
I 
came 
to 
the 
battle 
and 
have 
lost 
them."

"There 
now!" 
said 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers.

Another 
shook 
his 
head.

"Would 
you 
like 
a 
little 
mash?" 
the 
first 
soldier 
asked, 
and 
handed
Pierre 
a 
wooden 
spoon 
after 
licking 
it 
clean.

Pierre 
sat 
down 
by 
the 
fire 
and 
began 
eating 
the 
mash, 
as 
they 
called
the 
food 
in 
the 
cauldron, 
and 
he 
thought 
it 
more 
delicious 
than 
any 
food
he 
had 
ever 
tasted. 
As 
he 
sat 
bending 
greedily 
over 
it, 
helping 
himself
to 
large 
spoonfuls 
and 
chewing 
one 
after 
another, 
his 
face 
was 
lit 
up 
by
the 
fire 
and 
the 
soldiers 
looked 
at 
him 
in 
silence.

"Where 
have 
you 
to 
go 
to? 
Tell 
us!" 
said 
one 
of 
them.

"To 
Mozhaysk."

"You're 
a 
gentleman, 
aren't 
you?"

"Yes."

"And 
what's 
your 
name?"

"Peter 
Kirilych."

"Well 
then, 
Peter 
Kirilych, 
come 
along 
with 
us, 
we'll 
take 
you 
there."

In 
the 
total 
darkness 
the 
soldiers 
walked 
with 
Pierre 
to 
Mozhaysk.

By<p>
the 
time 
they 
got 
near 
Mozhaysk 
and 
began 
ascending 
the 
steep 
hill
into 
the 
town, 
the 
cocks 
were 
already 
crowing. 
Pierre 
went 
on 
with 
the
soldiers, 
quite 
forgetting 
that 
his 
inn 
was 
at 
the 
bottom 
of 
the 
hill
and 
that 
he 
had 
already 
passed 
it. 
He 
would 
not 
soon 
have 
remembered
this, 
such 
was 
his 
state 
of 
forgetfulness, 
had 
he 
not 
halfway 
up 
the
hill 
stumbled 
upon 
his 
groom, 
who 
had 
been 
to 
look 
for 
him 
in 
the
town 
and 
was 
returning 
to 
the 
inn. 
The 
groom 
recognized 
Pierre 
in 
the
darkness 
by 
his 
white 
hat.

"Your 
excellency!" 
he 
said. 
"Why, 
we 
were 
beginning 
to 
despair! 
How 
is
it 
you 
are 
on 
foot? 
And 
where 
are<p>
you 
going, 
please?"

"Oh, 
yes!" 
said 
Pierre.

The 
soldiers 
stopped.

"So 
you've 
found 
your 
folk?" 
said 
one 
of 
them.

round

seeing 
that

was 
not

ran 
to
look 
for 
her.

Running 
into

not 
finding 
her 
there, 
Natasha 
ran 
to
the

not

"I 
say, 
Berg, 
my 
dear 
fellow," 
said 
Rostov, 
"when 
you 
get 
a
letter 
from

he
exclaimed, 
and 
immediately 
seizing 
him 
by 
the 
shoulder 
and 
looking
amiably 
into 
his 
face, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/fO7baib1kQqNG2.html">evidently</a> 
wishing 
to 
soften 
the 
rudeness 
of 
his
words, 
he 
added, 
"Don't

"Oh,

"Go

brought

his 
boots 
mended 
with, 
went 
up 
to 
the 
sick 
man 
and
squatted 
down 
beside 
him.

"You 
know, 
Sokolov, 
they

<a href="/cZl/SE5HI7VWVhi6iGjCy.html">not</a>

They

You 
may 
be

said 
Pierre.

"O 
Lord! 
Oh, 
it 
will 
be 
the 
death 
of<p>

O 
Lord!" 
moaned 
the 
man 
in 
a
louder 
voice.

"I'll 
go 
and 
ask 
them 
again 
directly," 
said 
Pierre, 
rising 
and 
going 
to
the 
door 
of 
the 
shed.

Just 
as 
Pierre 
reached 
the 
door, 
the 
corporal 
who 
had 
offered 
him 
a
pipe 
the 
day 
before 
came 
up 
to 
it 
with 
two 
soldiers. 
The 
corporal 
and
soldiers 
were 
in 
marching 
kit 
with 
knapsacks 
and 
shakos 
that 
had 
metal
straps, 
and 
these 
changed 
their 
familiar 
faces.

The 
corporal 
came, 
according 
to 
orders, 
to 
shut 
the 
door. 
The 
prisoners
had 
to 
be 
counted 
before 
being 
let 
out.

"Corporal, 
what 
will 
they 
do 
with 
the 
sick 
man?..." 
Pierre 
began.

But 
even 
as 
he 
spoke 
he 
began 
to 
doubt 
whether 
this 
was 
the 
corporal
he 
knew 
or 
a 
stranger, 
so 
unlike 
himself 
did 
the 
corporal 
seem 
at 
that
moment. 
Moreover, 
just 
as 
Pierre 
was 
speaking 
a 
sharp 
rattle 
of 
drums
was 
suddenly 
heard 
from 
both 
sides. 
The 
corporal 
frowned 
at 
Pierre's
words 
and, 
uttering 
some 
meaningless 
oaths, 
slammed 
the 
door. 
The 
shed
became 
semidark, 
and 
the 
sharp 
rattle 
of 
the 
drums 
on 
two 
sides 
drowned
the 
sick 
man's 
groans.

"There 
it 
is!... 
It 
again!..." 
said 
Pierre 
to 
himself, 
and 
an
involuntary 
shudder 
ran 
down 
his 
spine. 
In 
the 
corporal's 
changed 
face,
in 
the 
sound 
of 
his 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Uc7hOZs5W6Mm.html">voice,</a> 
in 
the 
stirring 
and 
deafening 
noise 
of 
the
drums, 
he 
recognized 
that 
mysterious, 
callous 
force 
which 
compelled
people 
against 
their 
will 
to 
kill 
their 
fellow 
men-that 
force 
the 
effect
of 
which 
he 
had 
witnessed 
during 
the 
executions. 
To 
fear 
or<p>
to 
try 
to
escape 
that 
force, 
to 
address 
entreaties 
or 
exhortations 
to 
those 
who
served 
as 
its 
tools, 
was 
useless. 
Pierre 
knew 
this 
now. 
One 
had 
to 
wait
and 
endure. 
He 
did 
not 
again 
go 
to 
the 
sick 
man, 
nor 
turn 
to 
look 
at
him, 
but 
stood 
frowning 
by<p>
the 
door 
of 
the 
hut.

When 
that 
door 
was 
opened 
and 
the 
prisoners, 
crowding 
against 
one
another 
like 
a 
flock 
of 
sheep, 
squeezed 
into 
the 
exit, 
Pierre 
pushed
his 
way 
forward 
and 
approached 
that 
very 
captain 
who 
as<p>
the 
corporal 
had
assured 
him 
was 
ready 
to 
do 
anything 
for 
him. 
The 
captain 
was 
also 
in
marching 
kit, 
and 
on 
his 
cold 
face 
appeared 
that 
same 
it 
which 
Pierre
had 
recognized 
in 
the 
corporal's 
words 
and 
in 
the 
roll 
of 
the 
drums.

"Pass 
on, 
pass 
on!" 
the 
captain 
reiterated, 
frowning 
sternly, 
and
looking 
at 
the 
prisoners 
who 
thronged 
past 
him.

Pierre 
went 
up 
to 
him, 
though 
he 
knew 
his 
attempt 
would 
be 
vain.

"What 
now?" 
the 
officer 
asked 
with 
a 
cold 
look 
as 
if 
not 
recognizing
Pierre.

Pierre 
told 
him 
about 
the 
sick 
man.

"He'll 
manage 
to 
walk, 
devil 
take 
him!" 
said 
the 
captain. 
"Pass 
on, 
pass
on!" 
he 
continued 
without 
looking 
at 
Pierre.

"But 
he 
is 
dying," 
Pierre 
again 
began.

"Be 
so 
good..." 
shouted 
the 
captain, 
frowning 
angrily.

"Dram-da-da-dam, 
dam-dam..." 
rattled 
the 
drums, 
and 
Pierre 
understood
that 
this 
<a href="/aVzUge/Gd2ioN4Kzb7qLBzM.html">mysterious</a> 
force 
completely 
controlled 
these 
men 
and 
that 
it
was

useless 
to 
say 
any

The</a>

to 
keep 
silence 
when 
his

spoke 
of 
the

his

irritated 
her.

"She

march: 
in 
their 
greatcoats,

packs, 
and 
without

preparation
whatever.

A 
member 
of 
the 
Hofkriegsrath 
from

had 
come 
to 
Kutuzov 
the 
day
before 
with 
proposals 
and 
demands 
for 
him 
to 
join 
up 
with 
the 
army 
of
the 
Archduke 
Ferdinand 
and 
Mack, 
and 
Kutuzov, 
not 
considering 
this
junction 
advisable, 
meant, 
among 
other 
arguments 
in 
support 
of 
his 
view,
to 
show 
the<p>
Austrian 
general 
the 
wretched 
state 
in 
which 
the 
troops
arrived 
from 
Russia. 
With 
this 
object 
he 
intended 
to 
meet 
the 
regiment;
so 
the 
worse 
the 
condition 
it 
was 
in, 
the 
better 
pleased 
the 
commander

would 
be. 
Though 
the 
aide-de-camp 
did 
not 
know 
these
circumstances, 
he 
nevertheless 
delivered 
the 
definite 
order 
that 
the

should 
be 
in

greatcoats 
and 
in 
marching 
order,

that 
the

On

the

hung 
his

that 
Napoleon 
himself 
would 
be 
ashamed 
of 
them
when 
he 
came 
to 
his<p>
senses. 
Balashev 
stood 
with 
downcast 
eyes, 
looking
at 
the 
movements 
of 
Napoleon's 
stout 
legs 
and 
trying 
to 
avoid 
meeting
his 
eyes.

"But 
what 
do 
I 
care 
about 
your 
allies?" 
said 
Napoleon.<p>
"I 
have
allies-the 
Poles. 
There 
are 
eighty 
thousand 
of 
them 
and 
they 
fight 
like
lions. 
And 
there 
will 
be

And 
probably 
still 
more 
perturbed 
by 
the

that 
he 
had 
uttered 
this

and 
that 
Balashev 
still 
stood 
silently 
before 
him 
in
the 
same 
attitude 
of 
submission 
to 
fate, 
Napoleon 
abruptly 
turned
round, 
drew 
close<p>
to 
Balashev's 
face, 
and, 
gesticulating 
rapidly 
and
energetically 
with 
his 
white 
hands, 
almost 
shouted:

"Know 
that 
if 
you 
stir 
up 
Prussia 
against 
me, 
I'll 
wipe 
it 
off 
the

Europe!" 
he 
declared, 
his 
face 
pale 
and 
distorted 
by 
anger, 
and 
he
struck 
one 
of 
his 
small 
hands 
energetically 
with 
the 
other. 
"Yes, 
I
will 
throw 
you 
back 
beyond 
the 
Dvina 
and 
beyond 
the 
Dnieper, 
and 
will
re-erect 
against 
you 
that 
barrier 
which 
it 
was 
criminal 
and 
blind 
of
Europe 
to 
allow

Yes,

you.
That 
is 
what 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/VL930gJL.html">you</a>

And 
he 
walked 
silently
several 
times 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room, 
his 
fat 
shoulders 
twitching.

He 
put 
his 
snuffbox<p>
into 
his 
waistcoat 
pocket, 
took 
it 
out 
again, 
lifted
it 
several 
times 
to 
his 
nose, 
and 
stopped 
in 
front 
of 
Balashev. 
He
paused, 
looked 
ironically 
straight 
into 
Balashev's 
eyes, 
and 
said 
in 
a
quiet 
voice:

"And 
yet 
what 
a 
splendid 
reign 
your 
master 
might 
have 
had!"

Balashev, 
feeling 
it<p>
incumbent 
on 
him 
to 
reply, 
said 
that 
from 
the
Russian 
side 
things 
did 
not 
appear 
in 
so 
gloomy 
a 
light. 
Napoleon 
was
silent, 
still 
looking 
derisively 
at<p>
him 
and 
evidently 
not 
listening 
to
him. 
Balashev 
said 
that<p>
in 
Russia 
the 
best 
results 
were 
expected 
from
the 
war. 
Napoleon 
nodded 
condescendingly, 
as 
if 
to 
say, 
"I 
know 
it's
your 
duty 
to 
say 
that, 
but 
you 
don't 
believe 
it 
yourself. 
I 
have
convinced 
you."

When 
Balashev 
had 
ended, 
Napoleon 
again 
took 
out 
his 
snuffbox, 
sniffed
at 
it, 
and 
stamped 
his 
<a href="/cZl/uq9lLv1pbE7a.html">foot</a> 
twice 
on 
the 
floor

Mary

the

creak 
of 
that

which 
merged 
in 
her 
memory 
with 
what 
followed.)

She 
approached 
him, 
saw 
his 
face, 
and 
something 
gave 
way 
within 
her. 
Her
eyes 
grew 
dim. 
By 
the 
expression 
of 
her 
father's 
face, 
not 
sad, 
not
crushed, 
but 
angry 
and 
working 
unnaturally, 
she 
saw 
that 
hanging 
over
her 
and 
about 
to 
crush 
her<p>
was 
some 
terrible 
misfortune, 
the 
worst
in 
life, 
one 
she 
had 
not 
yet 
experienced, 
irreparable 
and
incomprehensible-the 
death 
of 
one 
she 
loved.

"Father! 
Andrew!"-said 
the 
ungraceful, 
awkward 
princess 
with 
such
an 
indescribable 
charm 
of 
sorrow 
and 
self-forgetfulness 
that 
her 
father
could 
not 
bear 
her 
look 
but 
turned 
away 
with 
a 
sob.

"Bad 
news! 
He's 
not 
among 
the 
prisoners 
nor 
among 
the 
killed!
Kutuzov 
writes..." 
and 
he 
screamed 
as 
piercingly 
as 
if 
he 
wished 
to
drive 
the 
princess 
away 
by 
that 
scream... 
"Killed!"

The 
princess 
did 
not 
fall 
down 
or 
faint. 
She 
was 
already 
pale, 
but 
on
hearing 
these 
words 
her 
face 
changed 
and 
something 
brightened 
in 
her
beautiful, 
radiant 
eyes. 
It 
was 
as 
if 
joy-a 
supreme 
joy 
apart 
from 
the
joys 
and<p>
sorrows 
of 
this 
world-overflowed 
the 
great 
grief 
within 
her.
She 
forgot 
all 
fear 
of 
her 
father, 
went 
up 
to 
him, 
took 
his 
hand, 
and
drawing 
him 
down 
put 
her 
arm 
round 
his 
thin, 
scraggy 
neck.

"Father," 
she 
said, 
"do 
not 
turn 
away 
from 
me, 
let 
us 
weep
together."

"Scoundrels! 
Blackguards!" 
shrieked 
the 
old 
man, 
turning 
his 
face
away 
from 
her. 
"Destroying 
the 
army, 
destroying 
the 
men! 
And 
why? 
Go,
go 
and 
tell 
Lise."

The 
princess 
sank 
helplessly 
into 
an 
armchair 
beside 
her 
father 
and
wept. 
She 
saw 
her 
brother 
now 
as 
he 
had 
been 
at 
the 
moment 
when 
he 
took
leave 
of 
her 
and 
of 
Lise, 
his 
look 
tender 
yet 
proud. 
She 
saw 
him 
tender
and 
amused 
as 
he 
was 
when 
he 
put 
on 
the 
little 
icon. 
"Did 
he 
believe?
Had 
he 
repented 
of 
his 
<a href="/cZl/Zt6JCLL4lmT1jDLTN.html">unbelief?</a> 
Was 
he 
now 
there? 
There 
in 
the 
realms
of 
eternal 
peace 
and 
blessedness?" 
she 
thought.

"Father, 
tell 
me 
how 
it 
happened," 
she 
asked 
through 
her<p>
tears.

"Go! 
Go! 
Killed 
in 
battle, 
where 
the 
best 
of 
<a href="/aVzUge/lv63BnCGW6Lpf.html">Russian</a>

glory 
were 
led 
to 
destruction. 
Go, 
Princess 
Mary. 
Go 
and 
tell
Lise. 
I 
will

When 
Princess 
Mary 
returned 
from 
her 
father, 
the 
little 
princess 
sat
working 
and 
looked 
up 
with 
that 
curious 
expression 
of 
inner, 
happy 
calm
peculiar 
to 
pregnant 
women. 
It 
was 
evident 
that 
her 
eyes 
did 
not 
see
Princess 
Mary 
but 
were 
looking 
within... 
into 
herself... 
at 
something
joyful 
and 
mysterious<p>
taking 
place 
within 
her.

"Mary," 
she 
said, 
moving 
away 
from 
the 
embroidery 
frame 
and 
lying
back, 
"give 
me 
your 
hand." 
She 
took 
her 
sister-in-law's 
hand 
and
held 
it 
below 
her 
waist.

Her 
eyes 
were 
smiling 
expectantly, 
her 
downy 
lip 
rose 
and 
remained
lifted 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/hO2YWUw3C9.html">in</a> 
childlike 
happiness.

Princess 
Mary 
knelt 
down 
before 
her 
and 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Qb3pAy2w7pVEYz.html">hid</a> 
her 
face 
in 
the 
folds

"There,

and 
a

kind 
of 
civilization 
of 
a 
small 
corner 
of 
the 
world 
called
Europe.

In 
1789 
a 
ferment 
arises 
in 
Paris; 
it 
grows, 
spreads, 
and 
is 
expressed
by 
a 
movement 
of 
peoples<p>
from 
west 
to 
east. 
Several 
times<p>
it 
moves
eastward 
and 
collides 
with 
a 
countermovement 
from 
the 
east 
westward.
In 
1812 
it 
reaches 
its 
extreme 
limit, 
Moscow, 
and 
then, 
with 
remarkable
symmetry, 
a 
countermovement 
occurs 
from 
east 
to 
west, 
attracting 
to
it, 
as 
the 
first 
movement 
had 
done, 
the 
nations 
of 
middle 
Europe. 
The
counter 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tv8YXnB9gle4CMvYt.html">movement</a> 
reaches 
the 
starting 
point 
of 
the 
first 
movement 
in 
the
west-Paris-and 
subsides.

During 
that 
twenty-year 
period 
an 
immense 
number 
of 
fields 
<a href="/cZl/PK8tHLaX8sfA3mTUVM.html">were</a> 
left
untilled, 
houses 
were 
burned, 
trade 
changed 
its

millions
of 
men

were 
impoverished, 
or<p>
were 
enriched, 
and 
millions
of 
Christian 
men 
professing 
the 
law 
of 
love 
of 
their 
fellows 
slew 
one
another.

What 
does 
all 
this 
mean? 
Why 
did 
it 
happen? 
What 
made 
those 
people 
burn
houses 
and 
slay<p>
their 
fellow 
men? 
What 
were 
the 
causes 
of 
these 
events?
What 
force 
made 
men 
act 
so? 
These 
are 
the 
instinctive, 
plain, 
and
most 
legitimate 
questions 
humanity 
asks 
itself 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eq19BwgT0.html">when</a> 
it 
encounters 
the
monuments 
and 
tradition 
of 
that 
period.

For 
a 
reply 
to 
these 
questions 
the 
common 
sense 
of 
mankind 
turns 
to 
the
science 
of 
history, 
whose 
aim 
is 
to 
enable 
nations 
and 
humanity 
to 
know
themselves.

If 
history 
had 
retained 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
ancients 
it 
would 
have
said 
that 
God, 
to 
reward 
or 
punish 
his 
people, 
gave 
Napoleon 
power 
and
directed 
his 
will 
to 
the 
fulfillment 
of 
the 
divine 
ends, 
and 
that 
reply
would 
have 
been 
clear 
and 
complete. 
One 
might 
believe 
or 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ro24om6yYzh.html">disbelieve
in</a> 
the 
divine 
significance 
of 
Napoleon, 
but 
for 
anyone 
believing 
in
it 
there 
would 
have 
been 
nothing 
unintelligible 
in 
the 
history 
of 
that
period, 
nor 
would 
there 
have 
been 
any 
contradictions.

But 
modern 
history 
cannot 
give 
that 
reply. 
Science 
does 
not 
admit 
the
conception 
of 
the 
ancients 
as 
to 
the 
direct 
participation 
of 
the 
Deity
in 
human 
affairs, 
and 
therefore 
history 
ought 
to 
give 
other 
answers.

Modern 
history 
replying 
to 
these 
questions 
says: 
you 
want 
to 
know 
what
this 
movement 
means, 
what 
caused 
it, 
and 
what 
force 
produced 
these
events?

hurriedly 
and 
merrily
began 
to 
devise</h1>and 
carry 
out 
a 
plan 
of 
how 
Princess 
Mary 
should 
be
dressed. 
Princess 
Mary's 
self-esteem 
was 
wounded 
by 
the 
fact 
that
the 
arrival 
of 
a 
suitor 
agitated 
her, 
and 
still 
more 
so 
by 
both
her 
companions' 
not 
having 
the<p>
least 
conception 
that 
it 
could 
be
otherwise. 
To 
tell 
them 
that 
she 
felt 
ashamed 
for 
herself 
and 
for 
them
would 
be 
to 
betray 
her 
agitation, 
while 
to 
decline 
their 
offers 
to
dress 
her 
would 
prolong 
their 
banter 
and 
insistence. 
She 
flushed, 
her
beautiful 
eyes 
grew 
dim, 
red<p>
blotches 
came 
on 
her 
face, 
and 
it 
took
on 
the 
unattractive 
martyrlike 
expression 
it 
so 
often 
wore, 
as 
she
submitted 
herself 
to 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
and 
Lise. 
Both 
these 
women
quite 
sincerely 
tried 
to 
make 
her 
look 
pretty. 
She 
was 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/BO6oC2Dj6INZ.html">so</a> 
plain 
that
neither 
of 
them 
could<p>
think 
of 
her 
as 
a 
rival, 
so 
they 
began 
dressing
her 
with 
perfect 
sincerity, 
and 
with 
the 
naive 
and 
firm 
conviction
women 
have 
that 
dress 
can 
make 
a 
face 
pretty.

"No<p>
really, 
my 
dear, 
this 
dress 
is 
not 
pretty," 
said 
Lise, 
looking
sideways 
at 
Princess 
Mary 
from 
a 
little 
distance. 
"You 
have 
a 
maroon
dress, 
have 
it 
fetched. 
Really! 
You 
know 
the 
fate 
of 
your 
whole 
life 
may
be 
at 
stake. 
But 
this 
one 
is 
too 
light, 
it's 
not 
becoming!"

It 
was 
not 
the 
dress, 
but 
the 
face 
and 
whole 
figure 
of 
Princess 
Mary
that 
was 
not 
pretty, 
but 
neither 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne 
nor 
the 
little
princess 
felt 
this; 
they 
still 
thought 
that 
if 
a 
blue 
ribbon 
were 
placed
in 
the 
hair, 
the 
hair 
combed 
up, 
and 
the 
blue 
scarf 
arranged 
lower 
on
the 
best 
maroon 
dress, 
and 
so 
on, 
all 
would 
be 
well. 
They 
forgot 
that
the 
frightened 
face 
and 
the 
figure 
could 
not 
be 
altered, 
and 
that
however 
they 
might 
change 
the 
setting 
and 
adornment 
of 
that 
face, 
it
would 
still 
remain 
piteous 
and 
plain. 
After 
two 
or 
three 
changes 
to
which 
Princess 
Mary 
meekly 
submitted, 
just 
as 
her 
hair 
had 
been 
arranged
on 
the 
top<p>
of 
her 
head 
(a 
style 
that 
quite 
altered 
and 
spoiled 
<a href="/aVzUge/xr1N9P2.html">her
looks)</a> 
and 
she 
had 
put 
on 
a 
maroon 
dress 
with 
a 
pale-blue 
scarf, 
the
little 
princess 
walked 
twice 
round 
her, 
now 
adjusting 
a 
fold 
of 
the
dress 
with 
her 
little 
hand, 
now 
arranging 
the 
scarf 
and 
looking 
at 
her
with 
her 
head 
bent<p>
first 
on 
one 
side 
and 
then 
on 
the 
other.

"No, 
it 
will 
not 
do," 
she 
said 
decidedly, 
clasping 
her 
hands. 
"No,
Mary, 
really 
this 
dress 
does 
not 
suit 
you. 
I 
prefer 
you 
in 
your 
little
gray 
everyday 
dress. 
Now 
please, 
do 
it 
for<p>
my 
sake. 
Katie," 
she 
said
to 
the 
maid, 
"bring 
the 
princess 
her 
gray 
dress, 
and 
you'll 
see,
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
how 
I 
shall 
arrange 
it," 
she 
added, 
smiling
with 
a 
foretaste 
of 
artistic 
pleasure.

But 
when 
Katie 
brought 
the 
required 
dress, 
Princess 
Mary 
remained
sitting 
motionless 
before 
the 
glass, 
looking 
at 
her 
face, 
and 
saw 
in 
the
mirror 
her 
eyes 
full 
of 
tears 
and 
her 
mouth 
quivering, 
ready 
to 
burst
into 
sobs.

"Come, 
dear 
princess," 
said 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
"just 
one 
more
little 
effort."

The 
little 
princess, 
taking 
the 
dress 
from 
the 
maid, 
came 
up 
to 
Princess
Mary.

"Well, 
now 
we'll 
arrange 
something 
quite 
simple 
and 
becoming," 
she
said.

The 
three 
voices, 
hers, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne's, 
and 
Katie's, 
who
was 
laughing 
at 
something, 
mingled 
in 
a 
merry 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/jT2bI3yxat5tLBOA.html">sound,</a> 
like 
the 
chirping
of 
birds.

"No, 
leave 
me 
alone," 
said 
Princess 
Mary.

Her 
voice 
sounded 
so 
serious 
and 
so 
sad 
that 
the 
chirping 
of 
the 
birds
was 
silenced 
at 
once. 
They 
looked 
at 
the 
beautiful, 
large, 
thoughtful
eyes 
full 
of 
tears 
and 
of 
thoughts, 
gazing 
shiningly 
and 
imploringly 
at
them, 
and 
understood 
that<p>
it 
was 
useless 
and 
even 
cruel 
to 
insist.

"At 
least, 
change 
your 
coiffure," 
said 
the 
little 
princess.
"Didn't 
I 
tell 
you," 
she 
went 
on, 
turning 
reproachfully 
to
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
"Mary's 
is

"Leave

is 
all 
quite

to

As

that 
he

It

essential 
for

On

he

round

stopped

got 
out

trap. 
A 
French 
cook 
accused 
of 
being 
a 
spy 
was 
being 
flogged. 
The
flogging 
was 
only 
just 
over, 
and 
the 
executioner 
was 
releasing 
from 
the
flogging 
bench 
a 
stout 
man 
with 
red 
whiskers, 
in 
blue 
stockings 
and
a 
green 
jacket, 
who 
was 
moaning 
piteously. 
Another 
criminal, 
thin

pale, 
stood

Judging

their

they 
were 
both 
Frenchmen. 
With

the 
crowd.

"What 
is 
it? 
Who 
is 
it? 
What 
is 
it 
for?" 
he 
kept 
asking.

But 
the 
attention 
of 
the 
crowd-officials, 
burghers, 
shopkeepers,
peasants, 
and 
women 
in

and 
at 
the

actually 
had 
so 
bad 
an 
effect
that 
Dron 
had 
finally 
given 
up 
the 
keys 
and 
joined 
the 
peasants 
and 
had
not 
appeared 
when 
Alpatych 
sent 
for 
him; 
and 
that 
in 
the 
morning 
when
the 
princess 
gave 
orders 
to 
harness 
for 
her 
journey, 
the 
peasants 
had
come 
in 
a 
large 
crowd 
to 
the 
barn 
and 
sent 
word 
that 
they 
would 
not 
let

leave 
the 
village: 
that 
there 
was 
an 
order 
not 
to 
move, 
and 
that
they 
would 
unharness 
the 
horses. 
Alpatych 
had 
gone 
out 
to 
admonish 
them,
but 
was 
told 
(it 
was 
chiefly 
Karp 
who 
did 
the 
talking, 
Dron 
not 
showing
himself 
in 
the 
crowd) 
that 
they 
could 
not 
let 
the 
princess 
go, 
that
there 
was 
an 
order 
to 
the 
contrary, 
but 
that 
if 
she 
stayed 
they<p>
would
serve 
her 
as 
before 
and 
obey 
her 
in 
everything.

At 
the 
moment 
when 
Rostov 
and 
Ilyin 
were 
galloping 
along 
the 
road,
Princess 
Mary, 
despite 
the 
dissuasions 
of 
Alpatych, 
her 
nurse, 
and 
the
maids, 
had 
given 
orders 
to 
harness 
and 
intended 
to 
start, 
but 
when 
the
cavalrymen 
were 
espied 
they 
were 
taken 
for 
Frenchmen, 
the 
coachman 
ran
away, 
and 
the 
women 
in 
the 
house 
began 
to 
wail.

"Father! 
Benefactor! 
God 
has 
sent 
you!" 
exclaimed 
deeply 
moved 
voices 
as
Rostov 
passed 
through 
the 
anteroom.

Princess 
Mary 
was 
sitting 
helpless 
and 
bewildered 
in 
the 
large 
sitting
room, 
when 
Rostov 
was 
shown 
in. 
She 
could 
not 
grasp 
who 
he 
was 
and 
why
he 
had 
come, 
or 
what 
was 
happening 
to 
her. 
When 
she 
saw 
his 
Russian
face, 
and 
by 
his 
walk 
and 
the 
first 
words 
he 
uttered 
recognized 
him 
as 
a
man 
of 
her 
own 
class, 
she 
glanced 
at 
him 
with 
her 
deep 
radiant 
look 
and
began 
speaking 
in 
a 
voice 
that 
faltered 
and 
trembled 
with 
emotion. 
This
meeting 
immediately 
struck 
Rostov 
as 
a 
romantic 
event. 
"A 
helpless 
girl
overwhelmed 
with 
grief, 
left 
to 
the 
mercy 
of<p>
coarse, 
rioting 
peasants!
And 
what 
a 
strange 
fate 
sent 
me 
here! 
What 
gentleness 
and 
nobility 
there
are 
in 
her 
features 
and 
expression!" 
thought 
he 
as 
he 
looked 
at 
her 
and
listened 
to 
her 
timid 
story.

When 
she 
began 
to 
tell 
him 
that 
all 
this 
had 
happened 
the 
day 
after 
her
father's 
funeral, 
her 
voice 
trembled. 
She 
turned 
away, 
and 
then, 
as 
if
fearing 
he 
might 
take 
her 
words 
as 
meant 
to 
move 
him 
to 
pity, 
looked 
at
him 
with 
an 
apprehensive 
glance 
of 
inquiry. 
There 
were 
tears 
in 
Rostov's
eyes. 
Princess 
Mary 
noticed 
this 
and 
glanced 
gratefully 
at 
him 
with 
that
radiant 
look 
which 
caused 
the 
plainness 
of 
her 
face 
to 
be 
forgotten.

"I 
cannot 
express, 
Princess, 
how<p>
glad 
I 
am 
that 
I 
happened 
to 
ride 
here
and 
am 
able 
to 
show 
my 
readiness 
to 
serve 
you," 
said 
Rostov, 
rising. 
"Go
when 
you 
please, 
and 
I 
give 
you 
my 
word 
of 
honor 
that 
no 
one 
shall 
dare
to 
cause 
you 
annoyance 
if 
only 
you 
will 
allow 
me 
to 
act 
as 
your 
escort."
And 
bowing<p>
respectfully, 
as 
if 
to 
a 
lady 
of 
royal 
blood, 
he 
moved 
toward
the 
door.

Rostov's 
deferential 
tone 
seemed 
to 
indicate 
that 
though 
he 
would
consider 
himself 
happy 
to 
be 
acquainted 
with 
her, 
he 
did 
not 
wish 
to
take 
advantage 
of 
her 
misfortunes 
to 
intrude 
upon 
her.

Princess 
Mary 
understood 
this 
and 
appreciated 
his 
delicacy.

"I 
am 
very, 
very 
grateful 
to 
you," 
she<p>
said 
in 
French, 
"but 
I 
hope 
it
was 
all 
a 
misunderstanding 
and 
that 
no 
one 
is 
to 
blame 
for 
it." 
She
suddenly 
began 
to 
cry.

"Excuse 
me!" 
she 
said.

Rostov, 
knitting 
his 
brows, 
left 
the 
room 
with 
another 
low 
bow.





CHAPTER 
XIV

"Well, 
is 
she<p>
pretty? 
Ah, 
friend-my 
pink 
one 
is 
delicious; 
her 
name 
is
Dunyasha...."

But 
on 
glancing 
at 
Rostov's 
face 
Ilyin 
stopped 
short. 
He 
saw 
that 
his
hero 
and 
commander 
was 
following 
quite 
a 
different 
train 
of 
thought.

Rostov 
glanced 
angrily 
at 
Ilyin 
and 
without 
replying 
strode 
off 
with
rapid 
steps 
to 
the 
village.

"I'll 
show 
them; 
I'll 
give 
it 
to 
them, 
the 
brigands!" 
said 
he 
to
himself.

Alpatych 
at 
a 
gliding 
trot, 
only 
just 
managing 
not 
to 
run, 
kept 
up 
with
him 
with 
difficulty.

"What 
decision 
have 
you 
been 
pleased 
to 
come 
to?" 
said 
he.

Rostov 
stopped 
and, 
clenching 
his 
fists, 
suddenly 
and 
sternly 
turned

The

Natasha-a

a

horseback-raised 
the 
curiosity 
of 
the 
serfs

such 
a
degree 
that 
many 
<a href="/aVzUge/HPe8aKB76LQJK.html">of</a>

up

stared

by

and 
not

what
was 
said 
about 
her.

"Arinka! 
Look,

There 
she

and 
her

See, 
she's

"Isn't 
she 
a 
Tartar!"

"How 
is 
it 
you 
didn't 
go 
head 
over 
heels?" 
asked 
the 
boldest 
of
all, 
addressing 
Natasha 
directly.

"Uncle" 
dismounted 
at 
the 
porch 
of 
his 
little 
wooden 
house 
which
stood 
in 
the 
midst 
of 
an 
overgrown 
garden 
and, 
after 
a 
glance 
at 
his
retainers, 
shouted 
authoritatively 
that 
the 
superfluous 
ones 
should 
take
themselves 
off 
and 
that 
all 
necessary 
preparations 
should 
be 
made 
to
receive 
the 
guests 
and 
the 
visitors.

The 
serfs 
all 
dispersed. 
"Uncle" 
lifted 
Natasha 
off 
her 
horse 
and
taking 
her 
hand 
led 
her 
up 
the 
rickety 
wooden 
steps 
of 
the 
porch. 
The
house, 
with 
its 
bare, 
unplastered 
log 
walls, 
was 
not 
overclean-it
did 
not 
seem 
that 
those 
living 
in 
it 
aimed 
at 
keeping 
it 
spotless-but
neither 
was 
it 
noticeably 
neglected. 
In 
the 
entry 
there 
was 
a 
smell 
of
fresh 
apples, 
and 
wolf 
and 
fox 
skins 
hung 
about.

"Uncle" 
led 
the 
visitors 
through 
the 
anteroom 
into 
a 
small 
hall 
with
a 
folding 
table 
and 
red 
chairs, 
then 
into 
the 
drawing 
room 
with 
a 
round
birchwood 
table 
and 
a 
sofa, 
and 
finally 
into 
his 
private 
room 
where
there 
was 
a 
tattered 
sofa, 
a 
worn 
carpet, 
and 
portraits 
of 
Suvorov, 
of
the 
host's 
father 
and 
mother, 
and 
of 
himself 
in 
military 
uniform. 
The
study 
smelt 
strongly 
of 
tobacco 
and 
dogs. 
"Uncle" 
asked 
his 
visitors
to 
sit 
down 
and 
make 
themselves 
at 
home, 
and 
then 
went 
out 
of 
the 
room.
Rugay, 
his 
back 
still 
muddy, 
came 
into 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/yPp5Ro2N0Sdo.html">room</a> 
and 
lay 
down 
on 
the
sofa, 
cleaning 
himself 
with 
his 
tongue 
and 
teeth. 
Leading 
from 
the 
study
was 
a 
passage 
in 
which 
a 
partition 
with 
ragged 
curtains 
could 
be
seen. 
From 
behind 
this 
came 
women's 
laughter 
and 
whispers. 
Natasha,
Nicholas, 
and 
Petya 
took 
off 
their 
wraps 
and 
sat 
down 
on 
the 
sofa.
Petya, 
leaning 
on 
his 
elbow, 
fell 
asleep 
at 
once. 
Natasha 
and 
Nicholas
were 
silent. 
Their 
faces 
glowed, 
they 
were 
hungry 
and 
very 
cheerful.
They 
looked 
at 
one 
another 
(now 
that 
the 
hunt 
was 
over 
and 
they 
were 
in
the 
house, 
Nicholas 
no 
longer 
considered 
it 
necessary 
to 
show 
his 
manly
superiority 
over 
his 
sister), 
Natasha<p>
gave 
him<p>
a 
wink, 
and 
neither
refrained 
long 
from 
bursting 
into 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/uqv2NY3epgGc3jl.html">peal</a> 
of 
ringing 
laughter 
even 
before
they 
had 
a 
pretext 
ready 
to 
account 
for 
it.

After 
a 
while 
"Uncle" 
came 
in, 
in 
a 
Cossack 
coat, 
blue 
trousers, 
and
small 
top 
boots. 
And 
Natasha 
felt 
that 
this 
costume, 
the 
very 
one 
she
had 
regarded 
with 
surprise 
and 
amusement 
at 
Otradnoe, 
was 
just 
the
right 
thing 
and 
not 
at 
all 
worse 
than 
a 
swallow-tail<p>
or 
frock 
coat.
"Uncle" 
too 
was 
in 
high 
spirits 
and 
far 
from 
being 
offended 
by 
the
brother's 
and 
sister's

Knowing 
that
one 
son 
was 
out 
of 
danger 
she 
became 
the 
more 
anxious 
about 
Petya.

Though 
by 
the 
twentieth 
of 
August 
nearly 
all 
the 
Rostovs' 
acquaintances
had 
left 
Moscow, 
and 
though

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/tE7ieWTn13oC.html">the</a> 
countess 
to
get

possible, 
she 
would 
not 
hear

before
her 
treasure, 
her<p>
adored 
Petya, 
returned. 
On 
the 
twenty-eighth 
of 
August
he 
arrived. 
The 
passionate 
tenderness 
with 
which 
his 
mother 
received 
him
did 
not 
please 
the 
sixteen-year-old 
officer. 
Though 
she 
concealed 
from
him 
her 
intention 
of 
keeping 
him<p>
under 
her 
wing, 
Petya 
guessed 
her
designs, 
and 
instinctively 
fearing 
that 
he 
might 
give 
way 
to 
emotion
when 
with<p>
her-might 
"become 
womanish" 
as 
he 
termed 
it 
to 
himself-he
treated 
her 
coldly, 
avoided 
her, 
and 
during 
his 
stay 
in 
Moscow 
attached
himself 
exclusively 
to 
Natasha 
for 
whom 
he 
had 
always 
had 
a 
particularly
brotherly 
tenderness, 
almost 
lover-like.

Owing 
to 
the 
count's 
customary 
carelessness 
nothing 
was 
ready 
for 
their
departure 
by 
the 
twenty-eighth 
of 
August 
and 
the 
carts 
that 
were 
to
come 
from 
their 
Ryazan 
and 
Moscow 
estates 
to 
remove 
their 
household
belongings 
did 
not 
arrive 
till 
the 
thirtieth.

From 
the 
twenty-eighth 
till 
the 
thirty-first 
all 
Moscow 
was 
in<p>
a 
bustle
and 
commotion. 
Every 
day 
thousands 
of 
men 
wounded 
at 
Borodino 
were
brought 
in 
by 
the 
Dorogomilov 
gate 
and 
taken 
to 
various 
parts 
of 
Moscow,
and 
thousands 
of 
carts 
conveyed 
the 
inhabitants 
and 
their 
possessions
out 
by 
the 
other 
gates. 
In 
spite 
of 
Rostopchin's 
<a href="/cZl/IE2S0T.html">broadsheets,</a> 
<a href="/aVzUge/iw8N8xt8Nw.html">or</a> 
because
of 
them 
or 
independently 
of

the 
strangest 
and 
most 
contradictory
rumors 
were 
current 
in 
the 
town. 
Some 
said 
that 
no 
one 
was 
to 
be 
allowed
to 
leave 
the 
city, 
others 
on 
the 
contrary 
said 
that 
all

icons 
had
been 
taken 
out 
of 
the 
churches 
and 
everybody 
was 
to 
be 
ordered 
to 
leave.
Some 
said 
there 
had 
been 
another 
battle 
after 
Borodino 
at 
which 
the
French 
had 
been 
routed, 
while 
others 
on 
the 
contrary 
reported 
that 
the
Russian 
army 
had 
been 
destroyed. 
<a href="/aVzUge/bfW6Gj0w8.html">Some</a> 
talked 
about 
the 
Moscow 
militia
which, 
preceded 
by 
the

others

Natasha's 
remark, 
but 
she 
did 
not 
express 
agreement 
in 
words.

"Is 
it 
possible 
to 
forget?" 
said 
she.

"It 
did 
me 
so 
much 
good 
to 
tell 
all 
about 
it 
today. 
It 
was 
hard 
and
painful,

good, 
very 
good!" 
said 
Natasha. 
"I 
am 
sure 
<a href="/cZl/Cw38mTUVM5WVP.html">he</a> 
really 
loved
him. 
That 
is 
why

<a href="/aVzUge/Oy5GCnw4J1.html">she</a>

suddenly
blushing.

"To

Oh, 
yes.

is!" 
said 
Princess
Mary.

"Do

Natasha 
suddenly 
said 
with 
a

CHAPTER 
XVII

Before 
two 
o'clock 
in 
the 
afternoon 
the 
Rostovs' 
four 
carriages, 
packed
full 
and 
with 
the 
horses 
harnessed, 
stood 
at 
the<p>
front 
door. 
One 
by 
one
the 
carts 
with 
the 
wounded 
<a href="/aVzUge/Ew6HAJD7Nqwe1.html">had</a> 
moved 
out 
of 
the 
yard.

The 
caleche 
in 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
being 
taken 
attracted 
Sonya's
attention 
as 
it 
passed 
the 
front 
porch. 
With 
the 
help 
of 
a 
maid 
she 
was
arranging 
a 
seat 
for 
the 
countess 
in 
the 
huge 
high 
coach 
that 
stood 
at
the 
entrance.

"Whose 
caleche 
is 
that?" 
she 
inquired, 
leaning 
out 
of 
the 
carriage
window.

"Why, 
didn't 
you 
know, 
Miss?" 
replied 
the 
maid. 
"The 
wounded 
prince: 
he
spent 
the 
night 
in 
our 
house 
and 
is 
going 
with 
us."

"But 
who 
is 
it? 
What's 
his 
name?"

"It's 
our 
intended 
that 
was-Prince 
Bolkonski 
himself! 
They 
say 
he 
is
dying," 
replied 
the 
maid 
with 
a 
sigh.

Sonya 
jumped 
out 
of 
the 
coach 
and 
ran 
to 
the 
countess. 
The 
countess,
tired 
out 
and 
already 
dressed 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kg3PUEsy6EAct6tsa.html">in</a> 
shawl 
and 
bonnet 
for 
her 
journey,
was 
pacing 
up 
and 
down 
the 
drawing 
room, 
waiting 
for 
the 
household 
to
assemble 
for 
the 
usual 
silent<p>
prayer 
with 
closed 
doors 
before 
starting.
Natasha 
was 
not 
in 
the 
room.

"Mamma," 
said 
Sonya, 
"Prince 
Andrew 
is 
here, 
mortally 
wounded. 
He 
is
going 
with 
us."

The 
countess 
opened 
her 
eyes 
in 
dismay 
and, 
seizing 
Sonya's 
arm, 
glanced
around.

"Natasha?" 
she 
murmured.

At 
that 
moment 
this 
news 
had 
only 
one 
significance 
for 
both 
of 
them.
They 
knew 
their 
Natasha, 
and 
alarm 
as 
to 
what 
would 
happen 
if 
she 
heard
this 
news 
stifled 
all 
sympathy 
for 
the 
man 
they 
both 
liked.

"Natasha 
does 
not 
know 
yet, 
but 
he 
is 
going<p>
with 
us," 
said 
Sonya.

"You 
say 
he 
is 
dying?"

Sonya 
nodded.

The 
countess 
put 
her 
arms 
around 
Sonya 
and 
began 
to 
cry.

"The 
ways 
of 
God 
are 
past

groaning 
on 
a

and
bowing 
to

in<p>
prayer, 
her 
door 
creaked 
and 
Natasha, 
also 
in
a 
dressing 
jacket 
with 
slippers 
on 
her 
bare 
feet 
and 
her 
hair 
in
curlpapers, 
ran 
in. 
The 
countess-her 
prayerful 
mood 
dispelled-looked
round 
and 
frowned. 
She 
was 
finishing 
her 
last 
prayer: 
"Can 
it 
be 
that
this 
couch 
will 
be 
my 
grave?" 
Natasha, 
flushed 
and 
eager, 
seeing
her 
mother 
in 
prayer, 
suddenly 
checked 
her 
rush, 
half 
sat 
down, 
and
unconsciously 
put 
out 
her 
tongue 
as 
if 
chiding 
herself. 
Seeing 
that
her 
mother 
was 
still 
praying 
she 
ran 
on 
tiptoe 
to 
the 
bed 
and, 
rapidly
slipping 
one 
little 
foot 
against 
the 
other, 
pushed 
off 
her 
slippers 
and
jumped 
onto 
the 
bed 
the 
countess 
had 
feared 
might 
become 
her 
grave. 
This
couch 
was 
high, 
with 
a 
feather 
bed 
and 
five 
pillows 
each 
smaller 
than
the 
one 
below. 
Natasha 
jumped 
on 
it, 
sank 
into 
the 
feather 
bed,<p>
rolled
over<p>
to 
the 
wall, 
and 
began 
snuggling 
up 
the 
bedclothes 
as 
she 
settled
down, 
raising 
her 
knees<p>
to 
her 
chin, 
kicking 
out 
and 
laughing 
almost
inaudibly, 
now 
covering 
herself 
up 
head 
and 
all, 
and 
now 
peeping 
at 
her
mother. 
The 
countess 
finished 
her 
prayers 
and 
came 
to 
the 
bed 
with 
a
stern 
face, 
but 
seeing 
that 
Natasha's 
head 
was 
covered, 
she 
smiled
in 
her 
kind, 
weak 
way.

"Now 
then, 
now 
then!" 
said 
she.

"Mamma, 
can 
we 
have 
a 
talk? 
Yes?" 
said 
Natasha. 
"Now, 
just 
one 
on
your 
throat 
and 
another... 
that'll 
do!" 
And 
seizing 
her 
mother 
round
the 
neck, 
she 
kissed 
her 
on 
the 
throat. 
In 
her 
behavior 
to 
her 
mother
Natasha 
seemed 
rough, 
but 
she 
was 
so 
sensitive 
and 
tactful 
that 
however
she 
clasped 
her 
mother<p>
she 
<a href="/cZl/gs6EnBVm3UQ1U.html">always</a> 
managed 
to 
do 
it 
without 
hurting 
her
or 
making 
her 
feel 
uncomfortable 
or 
displeased.

"Well, 
what 
is 
it 
tonight?" 
said 
the 
mother, 
having 
arranged 
her
pillows 
and 
waited 
until 
Natasha, 
after 
turning 
over 
a 
couple 
of 
times,
had 
settled 
down 
beside 
her 
under 
the 
quilt, 
spread 
out 
her 
arms, 
and
assumed 
a 
serious 
expression.

These 
visits 
of 
Natasha's 
at 
night 
before 
the 
count 
returned 
from 
his
club 
were 
one 
of 
the 
greatest 
pleasures 
of 
both 
mother, 
and 
daughter.

"What 
is<p>
it 
tonight?-But 
I 
have 
to 
tell 
you..."

Natasha 
put 
her 
hand 
on 
her 
mother's 
mouth.

"About 
Boris... 
I 
know," 
she 
said 
seriously; 
"that's 
what 
I
have 
come 
about. 
Don't 
say 
it-I 
know. 
No, 
do 
tell 
me!" 
and 
she
removed 
her 
hand. 
"Tell 
me, 
Mamma! 
He's 
nice?"

"Natasha, 
you 
are 
sixteen. 
At 
your 
age 
I 
was 
married. 
You 
say 
Boris
is 
nice. 
He 
is 
very 
nice, 
and 
I 
love 
him 
like 
a 
son. 
But 
what 
then?...
What 
are 
you 
thinking 
about? 
You 
have 
quite 
turned 
his 
head, 
I 
can 
see
that...."

As 
she 
said 
this 
the 
countess 
looked 
round 
at 
her 
daughter. 
Natasha
was 
lying 
looking 
steadily 
straight 
before 
her 
at 
one 
of 
the 
mahogany
sphinxes 
carved 
on 
the 
corners 
of 
the 
bedstead, 
so 
that 
the 
countess
only 
saw 
her 
daughter's 
face 
in 
profile. 
That 
face 
struck 
her 
by 
its
peculiarly 
serious 
and 
concentrated 
expression.

Natasha 
was 
listening 
and 
considering.

"Well, 
what 
then?" 
said 
she.

"You 
have 
quite 
turned 
his 
head, 
and 
why? 
What 
do 
you 
want 
of 
him? 
You
know 
you 
can't 
marry 
him."

"Why 
not?" 
said<p>
Natasha, 
without 
changing 
her 
position.

"Because 
he 
is 
young, 
because 
he 
is 
poor, 
because 
he 
is 
a 
relation...
and 
because 
you 
yourself 
don't 
love 
him."

"How 
do 
you 
know?"

"I 
know. 
It 
is 
not 
right, 
darling!"

"But 
if 
I 
want 
to..." 
said 
Natasha.

"Leave 
off 
talking 
nonsense," 
said 
the 
countess.

"But 
if 
I 
want 
to..."

"Natasha, 
I 
am 
in 
earnest..."

Natasha 
did 
not 
let 
her 
finish. 
She<p>
drew 
the 
countess' 
large 
hand 
to
her, 
kissed 
it 
on 
the 
back 
and 
then 
on 
the 
palm, 
then 
again 
turned 
it
over 
and 
began 
kissing

one 
knuckle,

"Oh

Natasha 
interrupted

"When
I

with

Do 
you 
remember 
when
I 
was

once 
about 
some 
plums? 
You 
were 
all 
dancing, 
and 
I 
sat
sobbing 
in 
the 
schoolroom? 
I 
shall 
never 
forget 
it: 
I 
felt 
sad 
and 
sorry
for 
everyone, 
for 
myself, 
and 
for 
everyone. 
And 
I 
was 
innocent-that
was 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rg15uFRs2Qc.html">the</a> 
chief 
thing," 
said 
Natasha. 
"Do

"I

answered 
Nicholas. 
"I

you
afterwards 
and 
wanted 
to 
comfort 
you, 
but 
do 
you

I

We 
were 
terribly 
absurd. 
I 
had 
a 
funny

wanted 
to 
give
it

Do

"And 
do 
you 
remember," 
Natasha 
asked 
with 
a 
pensive 
smile, 
"how
once, 
long, 
long 
ago, 
when 
we 
were 
quite 
little, 
Uncle 
called 
us 
into
the 
study-that 
was 
in 
the 
old 
house-and 
it 
was 
dark-we 
went 
in 
and
suddenly 
there 
stood..."

"A 
Negro," 
chimed 
in 
Nicholas 
<a href="/aVzUge/HIM9vxtj60IgdEd.html">with</a> 
a 
smile 
of 
delight. 
"Of 
course
I 
remember. 
Even 
now 
I 
don't 
know 
whether 
there 
really 
was 
a 
Negro, 
or
if 
we 
only 
dreamed 
it 
or 
were 
told 
about 
him."

"He 
was 
gray, 
you 
remember, 
and 
had 
white 
teeth, 
and 
stood 
and 
looked
at 
us...."

"Sonya, 
do 
you 
remember?" 
asked 
Nicholas.

"Yes, 
yes, 
I 
do<p>
remember 
something 
too," 
Sonya 
answered 
timidly.

"You 
know 
I 
have 
asked 
Papa 
and 
Mamma 
about 
that 
Negro," 
said
Natasha, 
"and 
they 
say 
there 
was 
no 
Negro 
at 
all. 
But 
you 
see, 
you
remember!"

"Of 
course 
I 
do, 
I 
remember 
his 
teeth 
as 
if 
I 
had 
just 
seen 
them."

"How 
strange 
it 
is! 
It's 
as 
if 
it 
were 
a 
dream! 
I 
like 
that."

"And 
do 
you 
remember 
how 
we 
rolled 
hard-boiled 
eggs 
in 
the 
ballroom,
and 
suddenly 
two 
old 
women 
began 
spinning 
round 
on 
the 
carpet? 
Was 
that
real 
or 
not? 
Do 
you 
remember 
what 
fun 
it 
was?"

"Yes, 
and 
you 
remember 
how 
Papa 
in 
his 
<a href="/aVzUge/Zhu4x3pbE.html">blue</a> 
overcoat 
fired 
a 
gun 
in
the 
porch?"

So 
they 
went 
through 
their 
memories, 
smiling 
with 
pleasure: 
not 
the 
sad
memories 
of 
old 
age, 
but 
poetic, 
youthful 
ones-those 
impressions 
of
one's 
most 
distant 
past 
in 
which 
dreams 
and 
realities 
blend-and 
they
laughed 
with 
quiet 
enjoyment.

Sonya, 
as 
always, 
did 
not 
quite 
keep 
pace

them,

they 
shared
the

felt, 
through 
her 
happiness, 
that 
there 
is 
another

unattainable

CHAPTER 
X

Natasha 
had 
married 
in 
the 
early 
spring 
of<p>
1813, 
and 
in 
1820 
already 
had
three 
daughters 
besides 
a 
son 
for 
whom 
she 
had 
longed 
and 
whom 
she 
was
now 
nursing. 
She 
had 
grown 
stouter 
and 
broader, 
so 
that 
it 
was 
difficult
to 
recognize 
in 
this 
robust, 
motherly 
woman 
the 
slim, 
lively 
Natasha 
of
former 
days. 
Her 
features 
were 
more 
defined 
and 
had 
a 
calm, 
soft,
and 
serene 
expression. 
In 
her 
face 
there 
was 
none 
of 
the 
ever-glowing
animation 
that 
had 
formerly 
burned 
there 
and 
constituted 
its 
charm.
Now 
her 
face 
and 
body 
were 
often 
all 
that 
one 
saw, 
and 
her 
soul 
was
not 
visible 
at 
all. 
All 
that 
struck 
the 
eye 
was 
a 
strong, 
handsome, 
and
fertile 
woman. 
The 
old 
fire 
very 
rarely 
kindled 
in 
her 
face 
now. 
That
happened 
only 
when, 
as 
was 
the 
case<p>
that 
day, 
her 
husband 
returned 
home,
or 
a 
sick 
child 
was 
convalescent, 
or 
when 
she 
and 
Countess 
Mary 
spoke 
of
Prince 
Andrew 
(she 
never 
mentioned 
him 
to<p>
her 
husband, 
who 
she 
imagined
was 
jealous 
of 
Prince 
Andrew's 
memory), 
or 
on 
the 
rare 
occasions 
when
something 
happened 
to 
induce 
her 
to 
sing, 
a 
practice 
she 
had 
quite
abandoned 
since 
her 
marriage. 
At 
the 
rare 
moments 
when 
the 
old 
fire
did 
kindle 
in 
her 
handsome, 
fully 
developed 
body 
she 
was 
even 
more
attractive 
than 
in 
former 
days.

Since 
their 
marriage 
Natasha 
and 
her 
husband 
had 
lived 
in 
Moscow, 
in
Petersburg, 
on 
their 
estate 
near 
Moscow,<p>
or 
<a href="/cZl/CW6Jn88yG.html">with</a> 
her 
mother, 
that 
is 
to
say, 
in 
Nicholas' 
house. 
The 
<a href="/cZl/mN8FX5mN2.html">young</a> 
Countess 
Bezukhova 
was 
not 
often 
seen
in 
society, 
and 
those 
who 
met 
her 
there 
were 
not 
pleased 
with 
her
and 
found 
her 
neither 
attractive 
nor 
amiable. 
Not 
that 
Natasha 
liked
solitude-she 
did 
not 
know 
whether 
she 
liked 
it 
or 
not, 
she 
even 
thought
that 
she 
did 
not-but 
with 
her 
pregnancies, 
her 
confinements, 
the 
nursing
of 
her 
children, 
and 
sharing 
every 
moment 
of 
her 
husband's 
life, 
she 
had
demands 
on 
her 
time 
which 
could 
be 
satisfied 
only 
by 
renouncing 
society.
All 
who 
had<p>
known 
Natasha 
before 
her 
marriage 
wondered 
at 
the 
change
in 
her 
as 
at 
something 
extraordinary. 
Only 
the 
old 
countess 
with 
her
maternal 
instinct 
had 
realized 
that 
all 
Natasha's 
<a href="/nocrawl/c8Rhi6R/JC1JL3N.html">outbursts</a> 
had 
been 
due
to 
her 
need 
of 
children 
and 
a 
husband-as 
she 
herself 
had 
once 
exclaimed
at 
Otradnoe 
not 
so 
much 
in 
fun 
as 
in 
earnest-and 
her 
mother 
was 
now
surprised 
at 
the 
surprise 
expressed 
by 
those 
who 
had 
never 
understood
Natasha, 
and 
she 
kept 
saying 
that 
she 
had 
always 
known 
that 
Natasha
would 
make 
an 
exemplary 
wife 
and 
mother.

"Only 
she 
lets 
her 
love 
of 
her 
husband 
and 
children 
overflow 
all
bounds," 
said 
the 
countess, 
"so 
that 
it 
even 
becomes 
absurd."

Natasha 
did 
not 
<a href="/cZl/xp64rJpLp5.html">follow</a> 
the 
golden 
rule 
advocated 
by 
clever 
folk,
especially 
by 
the 
French, 
which 
says 
that 
a 
girl 
should 
not 
let 
herself
go 
when 
she 
marries, 
should 
not 
neglect 
her 
accomplishments, 
should 
be
even 
more 
careful

And

ran 
out

Natasha 
did 
not

to

again 
and 
avoided 
her. 
With 
the

expression 
of 
agitated

guilt 
she 
went 
about

up

and<p>
at

Hard 
as 
it 
was 
for 
Sonya, 
she 
watched 
her 
friend 
and 
did 
not 
let 
her
out 
of 
her 
sight.

The 
day 
before 
the 
count 
was 
to 
return, 
Sonya 
noticed 
that 
Natasha 
sat
by 
the 
drawing 
room 
window 
all 
the 
morning 
as 
if 
expecting 
something 
and
that 
she 
made 
a 
sign 
to 
an 
officer 
who 
drove 
past, 
whom 
Sonya 
took 
to
be 
Anatole.

Sonya 
began 
watching 
her 
friend 
still 
more 
attentively 
and 
noticed 
that
at 
dinner 
and 
all 
that 
evening 
Natasha 
was 
in 
a 
strange 
and 
unnatural
state. 
She 
answered 
questions 
at 
random, 
began 
sentences 
she 
did 
not
finish, 
and 
laughed 
at<p>
everything.

After 
tea 
Sonya 
noticed 
a 
housemaid 
at 
Natasha's 
door 
timidly
waiting 
to 
<a href="/cZl/IMv9i5SXnSa2fCtXF.html">let</a> 
her

She 
let 
the 
girl 
go 
in, 
and 
then 
listening 
at
the 
door 
learned 
that 
another 
letter 
had 
been 
delivered.

Then 
suddenly 
it 
became 
clear 
to 
Sonya 
that 
Natasha 
had 
some 
dreadful
plan 
for 
that 
evening. 
Sonya 
knocked 
at 
her 
door. 
Natasha 
did 
not 
let
her 
in.

"She 
will 
run 
away 
with 
him!" 
thought 
Sonya. 
"She 
is 
capable 
of
anything. 
There 
was 
something 
particularly 
pathetic 
and 
resolute 
in
her 
face 
today. 
She 
cried 
as 
she 
said 
good-by

Sonya

"Yes,

she

you 
will 
make 
a<p>

mistake. 
Marry 
when 
you 
are 
old 
and 
good 
for 
nothing-or 
all 
that 
is
good 
and 
noble 
in 
you 
will 
be 
lost. 
It 
will 
all 
be 
wasted 
on 
trifles.
Yes! 
Yes! 
Yes! 
Don't 
look 
at 
me 
with 
such 
surprise. 
If 
you 
marry
expecting 
anything 
from 
yourself 
in 
the 
future, 
you 
will 
feel 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/uj2jbnI01f.html">at</a> 
every
step

CHAPTER 
IV

Having 
abandoned 
the 
conception 
of 
the 
ancients 
as 
to 
the 
divine
subjection 
of 
the 
will 
of 
a 
nation 
to 
some 
chosen 
man 
and 
the 
subjection
of 
that 
man's 
will 
to 
the 
Deity, 
history 
cannot 
without 
contradictions
take 
a 
single 
step 
till 
it 
has 
chosen 
one 
of 
two 
things: 
either 
a 
return
to 
the 
former 
belief 
in 
the 
direct 
intervention 
of 
the 
Deity 
in 
human
affairs 
or 
a<p>
definite 
explanation 
of 
the 
meaning 
of<p>
the 
force 
producing
historical 
events 
and 
termed 
"power."

A 
return 
to 
the 
first 
is 
impossible, 
the 
belief 
has 
been 
destroyed; 
and
so 
it 
is 
essential 
to 
explain 
what 
is 
meant 
by 
power.

Napoleon 
ordered 
an 
army 
to 
be 
raised 
and 
go 
to 
war. 
We 
are 
so
accustomed 
to 
that 
idea 
and 
have 
become 
so 
used 
to 
it 
that 
the 
question:
why 
did 
six 
hundred 
thousand 
men 
go 
to 
fight 
when 
Napoleon 
uttered
certain 
words, 
seems 
to 
us 
senseless. 
He 
had 
the 
power 
and 
so 
what 
he
ordered 
was 
done.

This 
reply 
is 
quite 
satisfactory 
if 
we 
believe 
that 
the 
power 
was 
given
him 
by 
God. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
we 
do 
not 
admit 
that, 
it 
becomes 
essential 
to
determine 
what 
is 
this 
power 
of 
one 
man 
over 
others.

It 
cannot 
be 
the 
direct 
physical 
power 
of 
a 
strong 
man 
over 
a 
weak 
one-a
domination 
based 
on 
the 
application 
or 
threat 
of 
physical 
force, 
like
the 
power 
of<p>
Hercules; 
nor 
can 
it 
be 
based 
on 
the 
effect 
of 
moral 
force,
as 
in 
their 
simplicity 
some 
historians 
think 
who 
say 
that 
the 
leading
figures 
in 
history 
are 
heroes, 
that 
is, 
men 
gifted 
with 
a 
special
strength 
of 
soul 
and 
mind 
called 
genius. 
This 
power 
cannot 
be 
based 
on
the 
predominance 
of 
moral 
strength, 
for, 
not 
to 
mention 
heroes 
such 
as
Napoleon 
about 
whose 
moral 
qualities 
opinions 
differ 
widely, 
history
shows 
us 
that 
neither 
a 
Louis 
XI 
nor 
a 
Metternich, 
who 
ruled 
over
millions 
of 
people, 
had 
any 
particular 
moral 
qualities, 
but 
on 
the
contrary 
were 
generally 
morally 
weaker 
than 
any 
of 
the 
millions 
they
ruled 
over.

If 
the 
source 
of 
power 
lies 
neither 
in 
the 
physical 
nor

On

Nicholas 
Rostov 
was 
welcomed
by 
his

The 
hunt 
servants
fell 
into 
line. 
The 
masters 
rode 
together. 
"Uncle," 
Rostov, 
and
Ilagin 
kept 
stealthily 
glancing 
at 
one 
another's 
dogs, 
trying 
not
to 
be 
observed 
by 
their 
companions 
and 
searching 
uneasily 
for 
rivals 
to
their 
own 
borzois.

Rostov 
was 
particularly 
struck 
by 
the 
beauty 
of 
a<p>
small, 
pure-bred,
red-spotted 
bitch 
on 
Ilagin's 
leash, 
slender 
but 
with 
muscles 
like
steel, 
a 
delicate 
muzzle, 
and 
prominent 
black 
eyes. 
He 
had 
heard 
of
the<p>
swiftness 
of 
Ilagin's 
borzois, 
and 
in 
that 
beautiful 
bitch 
saw 
a
rival 
to 
his 
own 
Milka.

In 
the 
middle 
of 
a 
sober 
conversation 
begun 
by 
Ilagin 
about 
the
year's 
harvest, 
Nicholas 
pointed 
to 
the 
red-spotted 
bitch.

"A 
fine 
little 
bitch, 
that!" 
said 
he 
in 
a 
careless 
tone. 
"Is 
she
swift?"

"That 
one? 
Yes, 
she's 
a 
good 
dog, 
gets 
what 
she's 
after,"
answered 
Ilagin 
indifferently, 
of 
the 
red-spotted 
bitch 
Erza, 
for
which, 
a 
year 
before, 
he 
had 
given 
a 
neighbor 
three 
families 
of 
house
serfs. 
"So 
in 
your 
parts, 
too, 
the 
harvest 
is 
nothing 
to 
boast 
of,
Count?" 
he 
went 
on, 
continuing 
the 
conversation 
they 
had 
begun. 
And
considering 
it 
polite 
to 
return 
the 
young 
count's 
compliment, 
Ilagin
looked 
at 
his 
borzois 
and 
picked 
out 
Milka 
who 
attracted 
his 
attention
by 
her 
breadth. 
"That 
black-spotted 
one 
of 
yours 
is 
fine-well
shaped!" 
said 
he.

"Yes, 
she's 
fast 
enough," 
replied 
Nicholas, 
and 
thought: 
"If
only 
a 
full-grown 
hare 
would 
cross 
the 
field 
now 
I'd 
show 
you 
what
sort 
of 
borzoi 
she 
is," 
and 
turning 
to 
his 
groom, 
he 
said 
he 
would
give 
a 
ruble 
to 
anyone 
who 
found 
a 
hare.

"I 
don't 
understand," 
continued 
Ilagin, 
"how 
some 
sportsmen 
can
be 
so 
jealous 
about 
game 
and 
dogs. 
For 
myself, 
I 
can 
tell 
you, 
Count,
I<p>
enjoy 
riding 
in 
company 
such 
as 
this... 
what 
could 
be 
better?" 
(he
again 
raised 
his 
cap 
to 
Natasha) 
"but 
as 
for 
counting 
skins 
and 
what
one 
takes, 
I 
don't 
care 
about 
that."

"Of 
course 
not!"

"Or 
being 
upset 
because 
someone 
else's 
borzoi 
and 
not 
mine 
catches
something. 
All 
I 
care 
about 
is 
to 
enjoy 
seeing 
the 
chase, 
is 
it 
not 
so,
Count? 
For 
I 
consider 
that..."

"A-tu!" 
came 
the 
long-drawn 
cry 
of 
one 
of 
the 
borzoi 
whippers-in,
who 
had 
halted. 
He 
stood 
on 
a 
knoll 
in 
the 
stubble, 
holding 
his 
whip
aloft, 
and 
again 
repeated 
his 
long-drawn 
cry, 
"A-tu!" 
(This 
call 
and
the 
uplifted 
whip 
meant 
that 
he 
saw 
a 
sitting 
hare.)

"Ah, 
he 
has 
found 
one, 
I 
think," 
said 
Ilagin 
carelessly. 
"Yes, 
we
must 
ride 
up.... 
Shall 
we 
both 
course 
it?" 
answered 
Nicholas, 
seeing
in 
Erza 
and 
"Uncle's" 
red 
Rugay 
two 
rivals 
<a href="/aVzUge/Uy7tHdfO66kZt.html">he</a> 
had 
never 
yet 
had
a 
chance 
of 
pitting 
against<p>
his 
own 
borzois. 
"And 
suppose 
they 
outdo
my 
Milka 
at 
once!" 
he 
thought 
as 
he 
rode 
with 
"Uncle" 
and 
Ilagin
toward 
the 
hare.

"A 
full-grown 
one?"<p>
asked 
Ilagin 
as 
he 
approached 
the 
whip 
who
had 
sighted 
the 
hare-and 
not 
without 
agitation 
he 
looked 
round 
and
whistled 
to 
Erza.

"And 
you, 
Michael 
Nikanorovich?" 
he 
said, 
addressing 
"Uncle."

The 
latter 
was 
riding 
with 
a 
sullen 
expression 
on 
his 
face.

"How 
can 
I 
join 
in? 
Why, 
you've 
given 
a 
village 
for 
each 
of 
your
borzois! 
That's 
it, 
come 
on! 
Yours 
are 
worth 
thousands. 
Try 
yours
against 
one 
another, 
you 
two, 
and 
I'll 
look 
on!"

"Rugay, 
hey, 
hey!" 
he 
shouted. 
"Rugayushka!" 
he 
added,
involuntarily 
by 
this 
diminutive 
expressing 
his 
affection 
and 
the 
hopes
he 
placed 
on 
this 
red 
borzoi. 
Natasha 
saw 
and 
felt 
the 
agitation 
the
two 
elderly 
men 
and 
her 
brother 
were 
trying 
to 
conceal, 
and 
was 
herself
excited 
by 
it.

halfway 
up 
the 
knoll

up

said 
Pierre,
with 
a 
trembling 
voice 
and 
some 
difficulty 
in 
utterance 
due 
to 
his
excitement 
and 
to 
being 
unaccustomed

"Have

asked 
him 
what

"You

The

cleared

to

object 
of 
our 
Order, 
the 
foundation 
on
which 
it 
rests 
and 
which 
no 
human 
power 
can 
destroy, 
is 
the 
preservation
and 
handing 
on 
to 
posterity 
of 
a 
certain 
important 
mystery... 
which
has 
come 
down 
to 
us 
from 
the 
remotest 
ages, 
even 
from 
the 
first 
man-a
mystery 
on 
which 
perhaps 
the 
fate 
of 
mankind 
depends. 
But 
since 
this
mystery 
is 
of 
such 
a 
nature 
that 
nobody 
can 
know 
or 
use 
it 
unless 
he 
be
prepared 
by 
long 
and 
diligent 
self-purification, 
not 
everyone 
can 
hope
to 
attain 
it 
quickly. 
Hence 
we 
have 
a 
secondary 
aim, 
that 
of 
preparing
our 
members 
as 
much 
as 
possible 
to 
reform 
their 
hearts, 
to 
purify 
and
enlighten 
their 
minds, 
by 
means 
handed 
on 
to 
us 
by 
tradition 
from 
those
who 
have 
striven 
to 
attain 
this 
mystery, 
and 
thereby 
to 
render 
them
capable 
of 
receiving 
it.

"By 
purifying 
and 
regenerating 
our 
members 
we 
try, 
thirdly, 
to 
improve
the<p>
whole 
human 
race, 
offering 
it 
in 
our 
members 
an 
example 
of 
piety
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/rh2BwOO9vVJZj8.html">virtue,</a> 
and 
thereby 
try 
with<p>
all 
our 
might 
to 
combat 
the 
evil 
which
sways 
the 
world. 
Think 
this 
over 
and 
I 
will 
come 
to 
you 
again."

On 
the 
tenth 
of 
August 
the 
regiment 
Prince 
Andrew 
commanded 
was 
marching
along 
the 
highroad 
past 
the 
avenue 
leading 
to 
Bald 
Hills. 
Heat 
and
drought 
had 
continued 
for 
more 
than 
three 
weeks. 
Each 
day 
fleecy 
clouds
floated 
across 
the 
sky 
and 
occasionally 
veiled 
the 
sun, 
but 
toward
evening 
the 
sky 
cleared 
again 
and 
the 
sun 
set 
in 
reddish-brown 
mist.
Heavy 
night 
dews 
alone 
refreshed 
the 
earth. 
The 
unreaped 
corn 
was
scorched 
and 
shed 
its 
grain. 
The 
marshes 
dried 
up. 
The 
cattle 
lowed 
from
hunger, 
finding 
no 
food 
on 
the 
sun-parched 
meadows. 
Only 
at 
night 
and
in 
the 
forests 
while 
the 
dew 
lasted 
was 
there 
any 
freshness. 
But 
on 
the
road, 
the 
highroad 
along 
which 
the 
troops 
marched, 
there 
was 
no 
such
freshness 
even 
at 
night 
or 
when 
the 
road 
passed 
through 
the 
forest; 
the
dew 
was 
imperceptible 
on 
the 
sandy 
dust 
churned 
up 
more 
than 
six 
inches
deep. 
As 
soon 
as 
day 
dawned 
the 
march 
began. 
The 
artillery 
and 
baggage
wagons 
moved 
noiselessly 
through 
the 
deep 
dust 
that 
rose 
to 
the 
very
hubs 
of 
the 
wheels, 
and 
the 
infantry 
sank 
ankle-deep 
in 
that 
soft,
choking, 
hot 
dust 
that 
never 
cooled 
even 
at 
night. 
Some 
of 
this 
dust
was 
kneaded 
by 
the 
feet 
and 
wheels, 
while 
the 
rest 
rose 
and 
hung 
like 
a
cloud 
over 
the 
troops, 
settling 
in 
eyes, 
ears, 
hair, 
and 
nostrils, 
and
worst 
of 
all 
in 
the 
lungs 
of 
the 
men 
and 
beasts 
as 
they 
moved 
along 
that
road. 
The 
higher 
the 
sun 
rose 
the 
higher 
rose 
that 
cloud 
of 
dust, 
and
through 
the 
screen 
of<p>
its 
hot 
fine 
particles 
one 
could 
look 
with 
naked
eye 
at 
the 
sun, 
which 
showed 
like 
a 
huge 
crimson 
ball 
in 
the 
unclouded
sky. 
There 
was 
no 
wind, 
and 
the 
men 
choked<p>
in 
that 
motionless
atmosphere. 
They 
marched 
with 
handkerchiefs 
tied 
over 
their 
noses 
and
mouths. 
When 
they 
passed 
through 
a 
village 
they 
all 
rushed 
to 
the 
wells
and 
fought 
for 
the 
water 
and 
drank 
it 
down 
to 
the 
mud.

At 
the 
time 
I
gave 
him 
no 
answer.<p>
Now 
I 
recalled 
every 
detail 
of 
that 
meeting 
and 
in
my 
mind 
gave 
him 
the 
most 
malevolent 
and 
bitter 
replies. 
I 
recollected
myself 
and 
drove 
away 
that 
thought 
only 
when 
I 
found 
myself 
glowing 
with
anger, 
but 
I 
did 
not 
sufficiently 
repent. 
Afterwards 
Boris 
Drubetskoy
came 
and 
began 
relating 
various 
adventures. 
His 
coming 
vexed 
me 
from 
the
first, 
and 
I 
said 
something 
disagreeable 
to 
him. 
He 
replied. 
I 
flared
up 
and 
said 
much 
that 
was 
unpleasant 
and<p>
even 
rude 
to 
him. 
He 
became
silent, 
and 
I 
recollected 
myself 
only 
when 
it 
was 
too 
late. 
My 
God, 
I
cannot 
get 
on 
with 
him 
at 
all. 
The 
cause 
of 
this 
is 
my 
egotism. 
I 
set
myself 
above 
him 
and 
so 
become<p>
much 
worse 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kZ4fOHvf2WG6GdRBS.html">than</a> 
he, 
for 
he 
is 
lenient
to 
my 
rudeness 
<a href="/aVzUge/iw8N8xt8Nw.html">while</a> 
I 
on 
the 
contrary 
nourish 
contempt 
for 
him. 
O 
God,
grant 
that 
in 
his 
presence 
I 
may 
rather 
see 
my 
own 
vileness, 
and 
behave
so 
that 
he 
too 
may 
benefit. 
After 
dinner 
I 
fell 
asleep 
and 
as 
I 
was
drowsing 
off 
I 
clearly 
heard 
a 
voice 
saying 
in 
my 
left 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/iG2oJSwZ6rqw6.html">ear,</a> 
"Thy
day!"

I 
dreamed 
that 
I 
was 
walking 
in 
the 
dark 
and 
was 
suddenly 
surrounded 
by
dogs, 
but 
I 
went 
on 
undismayed. 
Suddenly 
a 
smallish 
dog 
seized 
my 
left
thigh<p>
with 
its 
teeth 
and 
would 
not 
let 
go. 
I 
began 
to 
throttle 
it 
with
my 
hands. 
Scarcely 
had 
I 
torn 
it 
off 
before 
another, 
a 
bigger 
one, 
began
biting 
me. 
I 
lifted 
it 
up, 
but 
the 
higher 
I 
lifted 
it 
the 
bigger 
and
heavier 
it 
grew. 
And<p>
suddenly 
Brother 
A. 
came 
and, 
taking 
my 
arm, 
led
me 
to 
a 
building 
to 
enter 
which 
we 
had 
to 
pass 
along 
a 
narrow 
plank.
I 
stepped 
on 
it, 
but 
it 
bent 
and 
gave 
way 
and 
I 
began 
to 
clamber 
up 
a
fence 
which 
I 
could 
scarcely 
reach 
with 
my 
hands. 
After 
much 
effort 
I
dragged 
myself 
up, 
so 
that 
my 
leg 
hung 
down 
on 
one 
side 
and 
my 
body 
on
the 
other. 
I 
looked 
round 
and 
saw 
Brother 
A. 
standing 
on 
the 
fence 
and
pointing 
me 
to 
a 
broad 
avenue 
and 
garden, 
and 
in 
the 
garden 
was 
a 
large
and 
beautiful 
building. 
I 
woke 
up. 
O 
Lord, 
great 
Architect 
of 
Nature,
help 
me 
to 
tear 
from 
myself 
these 
dogs-my 
passions 
especially 
the
last, 
which 
unites 
in 
itself 
the 
strength 
of 
all 
the 
former 
ones, 
and
aid 
me 
to 
enter 
that 
temple 
of 
virtue 
to 
a 
vision 
of 
which 
I 
attained 
in
my 
dream.


7th 
December

I 
dreamed 
that 
Joseph 
Alexeevich 
was 
sitting 
in 
my 
house, 
and 
that 
I
was 
very 
glad 
and 
wished 
to 
entertain 
him.<p>
It 
seemed 
as 
if 
I 
chattered
incessantly 
with 
other 
people 
and 
suddenly 
remembered 
that 
this 
could
not 
please 
him, 
and 
I 
wished 
to 
come<p>
close 
to 
him 
and 
embrace<p>
him. 
But
as 
soon 
as 
I 
drew 
near 
I 
saw 
that 
his 
face 
had 
changed 
and 
grown 
young,
and 
he 
was 
quietly 
telling 
me 
something 
about 
the 
teaching 
of 
our 
order,
but 
so 
softly 
that 
I 
could 
not 
hear 
it.

Again 
he

Prince 
Andrew, 
but 
before 
the

had 
left 
the 
room 
Kutuzov 
gave 
a 
sigh 
of 
relief 
and 
went 
on 
with 
his
unfinished 
novel, 
Les 
Chevaliers 
du 
Cygne 
by 
Madame 
de 
Genlis.

Prince 
Andrew 
could 
not 
have 
explained 
how 
or 
why 
it 
was, 
but 
after 
that
interview 
with 
Kutuzov 
he 
went 
back 
to 
<a href="/cZl/tQp9Yvhw6iOfK3lFuWA.html">his</a>

as 
to
the 
general 
course 
of 
affairs 
and 
as 
to 
the 
man 
to 
whom 
it 
had 
been
entrusted. 
The 
more 
he 
realized 
the 
absence 
of 
all<p>
personal 
motive 
in
that 
old 
man-in 
whom 
there 
seemed 
to 
remain 
only 
the 
habit 
of 
passions,
and 
in 
place 
of 
an 
intellect 
(grouping 
events 
and 
drawing 
conclusions)
only 
the 
capacity 
calmly 
to 
contemplate 
the 
course 
of 
events-the 
more
reassured 
he 
was 
that 
everything 
would 
be 
as 
<a href="/aVzUge/mx1EnBVm2o0EoOV.html">it</a> 
should. 
"He 
will 
not
bring

any 
plan

his 
own. 
He 
will 
not 
devise<p>
or 
undertake
anything," 
thought 
Prince 
Andrew, 
"but 
he 
will 
hear 
everything, 
remember
everything, 
and 
put 
everything 
in 
its 
place. 
He 
will 
not 
hinder
anything 
useful 
nor 
allow 
anything 
harmful. 
He 
understands 
that 
there 
is
something 
<a href="/aVzUge/vx1R08LZ.html">stronger</a> 
and 
more 
important 
than 
his

that

brought 
us 
to!' 
and 
had 
a 
sob 
in 
it 
when 
he 
said
he 
would 
'make 
them 
eat 
horseflesh!'"

On 
such 
feelings, 
more 
or 
less 
dimly 
shared 
by 
all, 
the 
unanimity 
and
general 
approval 
were 
founded 
with 
which, 
despite 
court 
influences, 
the
popular 
choice 
of 
Kutuzov 
as 
commander 
in 
chief 
was 
received.





CHAPTER 
XVII

After 
the 
Emperor 
had 
left 
Moscow, 
life 
flowed 
on 
there 
in 
its 
usual
course, 
and 
its 
course 
was 
so 
very 
usual 
that 
it 
was 
difficult 
to
remember 
the 
recent 
days 
of 
patriotic 
elation 
and 
ardor, 
hard 
to 
believe
that 
Russia 
was 
really

The 
other
generals, 
however, 
understood 
it</h1>and, 
leaving 
aside 
the 
question 
of
Moscow, 
spoke 
of 
the 
direction 
the 
army 
should 
take 
in 
its 
retreat.
Malasha, 
who 
kept 
her 
eyes 
fixed 
on 
what 
was 
going 
on 
before 
her,
understood 
the 
meaning 
of 
the 
council 
differently. 
It 
seemed 
to 
her 
that
it<p>
was 
only 
a 
personal 
struggle 
between 
"Granddad" 
and 
"Long-coat" 
as
she 
termed 
Bennigsen. 
She 
saw 
that 
they 
grew 
spiteful 
when 
they 
spoke 
to
one 
another, 
and 
in 
her 
heart 
she 
sided 
with 
"Granddad."<p>
In 
the 
midst 
of
the 
conversation 
she 
noticed 
"Granddad" 
give 
Bennigsen 
a 
quick, 
subtle
glance, 
and 
then 
to 
her 
joys 
she 
saw 
that 
"Granddad" 
said 
something 
to
"Long-coat" 
which 
settled 
him. 
Bennigsen 
suddenly 
reddened 
and 
paced
angrily 
up 
and 
down 
the 
room. 
What 
so 
affected 
him 
was 
Kutuzov's 
calm
and 
quiet 
comment 
on 
the 
advantage 
or 
disadvantage 
of 
Bennigsen's
proposal 
to<p>
move 
troops 
by 
night 
from 
the 
right 
to 
the 
left 
flank 
to
attack 
the 
French 
right 
wing.

"Gentlemen," 
said 
Kutuzov, 
"I 
cannot 
approve 
of 
the 
count's 
plan. 
Moving
troops 
in 
close 
proximity 
to 
an 
enemy 
is 
always 
dangerous, 
and 
military
history 
supports 
that 
view. 
For 
instance..." 
Kutuzov 
seemed 
to 
reflect,
searching 
for 
an 
example, 
then 
with 
a 
clear, 
naive 
look 
at 
Bennigsen 
he
added: 
"Oh 
yes; 
take 
the 
battle 
of 
Friedland, 
which 
I 
think 
the 
count
well 
remembers, 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/LQ8pDix3OpC0cmeax.html">which</a> 
was... 
not 
fully 
successful, 
only 
because 
our
troops 
were 
rearranged 
too 
near 
the 
enemy...."

There 
followed 
a 
momentary 
pause, 
which 
seemed 
very 
long 
to 
them<p>
all.

The 
discussion 
recommenced, 
but<p>
pauses 
frequently 
occurred 
and 
they 
all
felt 
that 
there 
was 
no 
more 
to 
be 
said.

During 
one 
of 
these 
pauses 
Kutuzov 
heaved 
a 
deep 
sigh 
as 
if 
preparing 
to
speak. 
They 
all 
looked 
at 
him.

"Well, 
gentlemen, 
I 
see 
that 
it 
is 
I 
who 
will 
have 
to 
pay 
for 
the 
broken
crockery," 
said 
he, 
and 
rising 
slowly 
he 
moved 
to 
the 
table. 
"Gentlemen,
I 
have 
heard 
your 
views. 
Some 
of 
you 
will 
not 
agree 
with 
me. 
But 
I," 
he
paused, 
"by 
the 
authority 
entrusted 
to 
me 
by 
my 
Sovereign 
and 
country,
order 
a 
retreat."

After 
that 
the 
generals 
began 
to 
disperse 
with<p>
the 
solemnity 
and
circumspect 
silence 
of 
people 
who 
are 
leaving, 
after 
a 
funeral.

Some 
of 
the 
generals, 
in 
low 
tones 
and 
in 
a 
strain 
very 
different 
from
the 
way 
they<p>
had 
spoken 
during 
the 
council, 
communicated 
something 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/UJ1pbE40b.html">to
their</a> 
commander 
in 
chief.

Malasha, 
who 
had 
long 
been 
expected 
for 
supper, 
climbed 
carefully
backwards 
down 
from 
the 
oven, 
her 
bare 
little 
feet 
catching 
at 
its
projections, 
and 
slipping 
between 
the 
legs 
of 
the 
generals 
she 
darted
out 
of 
the 
room.

When 
he 
had 
dismissed 
the 
generals 
Kutuzov 
sat 
a 
long 
time 
with 
his
elbows 
on 
the 
table, 
thinking 
always 
of 
the 
same 
terrible 
question:
"When, 
when 
did 
the 
abandonment 
of 
Moscow 
become 
inevitable? 
When 
was
that 
done 
which 
settled 
the 
matter? 
And 
who 
was 
to 
blame 
for 
it?"

"I 
did 
not 
expect 
this," 
said 
he 
to 
his 
adjutant 
Schneider 
when 
the
latter 
came 
in 
late 
that 
night.<p>
"I 
did 
not 
expect 
this! 
I 
did 
not 
think
this 
would 
happen."

"You 
should 
take 
some 
rest, 
your 
Serene 
Highness," 
replied 
Schneider.

"But 
no! 
They 
shall 
eat 
horseflesh 
yet, 
like 
the 
Turks!" 
exclaimed
Kutuzov 
without 
replying, 
striking

table

who 
for 
some 
reason 
imagined 
that
Pierre 
too 
loved 
her. 
"He 
will 
do 
anything 
for 
me."

Bilibin 
puckered 
his 
skin 
in 
preparation 
for 
something 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NXJ5AHAK.html">witty.

"Even</a> 
divorce 
you?" 
said 
he.

Helene 
laughed.

Among 
those 
who 
ventured 
to 
doubt 
the 
justifiability 
of 
the 
proposed
marriage 
was 
Helene's 
mother, 
Princess 
Kuragina. 
She 
was 
continually
tormented 
by 
jealousy 
of 
her 
daughter, 
and 
now 
that 
jealousy 
concerned
a 
subject 
near 
to 
her 
own 
heart, 
she 
could 
not 
reconcile 
herself 
to 
the
idea. 
She 
consulted 
a 
Russian 
priest 
as 
to 
the 
possibility 
of 
divorce
and 
remarriage 
during 
a 
husband's 
lifetime, 
and 
the 
priest 
told 
her 
that
it 
was 
impossible, 
and 
to 
her 
delight 
showed 
her 
a 
text 
in 
the 
Gospel
which 
(as 
it 
seemed 
to 
him) 
plainly 
forbids 
remarriage 
while 
the 
husband
is 
alive.

Armed 
with 
these 
arguments, 
which 
appeared 
to 
her 
unanswerable, 
she
drove 
to 
her 
daughter's 
early<p>
one 
morning 
so 
as 
to 
find 
her 
alone.

Having 
listened 
to 
her 
mother's 
objections, 
Helene 
smiled 
blandly 
and
ironically.

"But 
it 
says 
plainly: 
'Whosoever 
shall 
marry 
her 
that 
is 
divorced...'"
said 
the 
old 
princess.

"Ah, 
Maman, 
ne 
dites 
pas 
de 
betises. 
Vous 
ne 
comprenez 
rien. 
Dans 
ma
position 
j'ai 
des 
devoirs," 
* 
said 
Helene 
changing 
from 
Russian, 
in
which 
language 
she 
always 
felt 
that 
her 
case 
did 
not 
sound 
quite 
clear,
into 
French 
which 
suited 
it 
better.

 
 
 
 
 
* 
"Oh, 
Mamma, 
don't 
talk 
nonsense! 
You 
don't 
understand
 
 
 
 
 
anything. 
In 
my 
position 
I 
have 
obligations."


"But, 
my 
dear...."

"Oh, 
Mamma, 
how 
is 
it 
you 
don't 
understand 
that 
the 
Holy 
Father, 
who 
has
the 
right 
to 
grant 
dispensations..."

Just 
then 
the 
lady 
companion 
who 
lived 
with 
Helene 
came 
in 
to 
announce
that 
His 
Highness 
was 
in 
the 
ballroom 
and 
wished 
to 
see 
her.

"Non, 
dites-lui 
que 
je 
ne 
veux 
pas 
le 
voir, 
que 
je 
suis 
furieuse 
contre
lui, 
parce 
qu'il 
m'a

"No,

don't

to 
see

"Comtesse, 
a 
tout

misericorde," 
* 
said 
a 
fair-haired 
young 
man
with 
a 
long 
face 
and 
nose, 
as 
he 
entered 
the 
room.

 
 
 
 
* 
"Countess, 
there 
is 
mercy 
for 
every 
sin."


The 
old 
princess 
rose 
respectfully 
and 
curtsied. 
The 
young 
man 
who<p>
had
entered<p>
took 
no 
notice 
of 
her. 
The 
princess 
nodded 
to 
her 
daughter 
and
sidled 
out 
of 
the 
room.

"Yes, 
she 
is 
right," 
thought 
the 
old 
princess, 
all 
her 
convictions
dissipated 
by 
the 
appearance 
of 
His 
Highness. 
"She 
is 
right, 
but 
how
is 
it 
that 
we 
in 
our 
irrecoverable 
youth 
did 
not 
know 
it? 
Yet 
it 
is 
so
simple," 
she 
thought 
as 
she 
got<p>
into 
her 
carriage.


By 
the<p>
beginning 
of 
August 
Helene's 
affairs 
were 
clearly 
defined 
and
she 
wrote 
a 
letter 
to 
her 
husband-who, 
as 
she 
imagined, 
loved 
her 
very
much-informing 
him 
of 
her 
intention 
<a href="/cZl/qv22GLY3BAcC.html">to</a> 
marry 
N.N. 
and 
of 
her 
having
embraced 
the 
one 
true 
faith, 
and 
asking 
him 
to 
carry 
out 
all 
the
formalities 
necessary 
for 
a 
divorce, 
which 
would 
be 
explained 
to 
him 
by
the 
bearer 
of 
the 
letter.

And 
so 
I 
pray 
God 
to 
have 
you, 
my 
friend, 
in 
His 
holy 
and 
powerful
keeping-Your

Rostov's 
share 
in 
Dolokhov's 
duel 
with 
Bezukhov 
was 
hushed 
up 
by
the 
efforts 
of 
the 
old 
count, 
and 
instead 
of 
being 
degraded 
to 
the 
ranks
as 
he 
expected 
he 
was 
appointed 
an<p>
adjutant 
to 
the 
governor 
general 
of
Moscow. 
As

he

rest

the

but 
was 
kept 
all 
summer 
in 
Moscow 
by 
his 
new 
duties. 
Dolokhov
recovered, 
and 
Rostov 
became 
very 
friendly 
with 
him 
during 
his
convalescence. 
Dolokhov 
lay 
ill 
at 
his 
mother's 
who 
loved 
him
passionately 
and 
tenderly, 
and 
old 
Mary 
Ivanovna, 
who 
had 
grown 
fond 
of
Rostov 
for 
his 
friendship 
to 
her 
Fedya, 
often 
talked 
to 
him 
about 
her
son.

"Yes, 
Count," 
she 
would 
say, 
"he 
is 
too 
noble

No

Now 
tell

Silence 
ensued. 
The 
countess 
looked 
at 
her 
callers, 
smiling 
affably,
but 
not 
concealing 
the 
fact 
that 
she 
would 
not 
be 
distressed 
if 
they
now 
rose 
and 
took 
their 
leave. 
The 
visitor's 
daughter 
was 
already
smoothing 
down 
her 
dress 
with 
an 
inquiring<p>
look 
at 
her 
mother, 
when
suddenly 
from 
the 
next 
room 
were 
heard 
the 
footsteps 
of 
boys 
and 
girls
running 
to 
the 
door 
and 
the 
noise 
of 
a 
chair 
falling 
over, 
and 
a 
girl
of 
thirteen, 
hiding<p>
something 
in 
the 
folds 
of 
her 
short 
muslin 
frock,
darted 
in 
and 
stopped 
short 
in 
the 
middle 
of

It 
was 
evident
that

not

flight

Behind

with 
a 
crimson

an 
officer
of 
the 
Guards, 
a 
girl 
of 
fifteen, 
and 
a 
plump 
rosy-faced 
boy 
in 
a 
short
jacket.

The 
count 
jumped 
up<p>
and, 
swaying 
from 
side

side, 
spread 
his 
arms 
wide
and 
threw 
them 
<a href="/cZl/ZV2ieWTn42LcEl.html">round</a> 
the 
little 
girl 
who 
had 
run 
in.

"Ah,

he

laughing. 
"My

"Ma

the

with
feigned 
severity. 
"You

romantic 
friendship 
between 
a 
man 
and 
a 
woman 
of 
which 
she 
had 
known
several 
instances.

Before 
the 
end 
of 
the 
fast 
of 
St. 
Peter, 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna 
Belova, 
a
country 
neighbor 
of 
the 
Rostovs, 
came 
to 
Moscow 
to 
pay 
her 
devotions 
at
the 
shrines 
of 
the 
Moscow 
saints. 
She 
suggested 
that 
Natasha 
should 
fast
and 
prepare 
for 
Holy 
Communion, 
and 
Natasha 
gladly 
welcomed 
the 
idea.
Despite 
the 
doctor's 
orders 
that 
she 
should 
not 
go 
out 
early 
in 
the
morning, 
Natasha 
insisted 
on 
fasting 
and 
preparing 
for 
the 
sacrament,
not 
as 
they 
generally 
prepared 
for 
it 
in 
the 
Rostov 
family 
by 
attending
three 
services 
in 
their 
own 
house, 
but 
as 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna 
did, 
by
going 
to 
church 
every 
day 
for 
a 
week 
and 
not 
once 
missing 
Vespers,
Matins, 
or 
Mass.

The 
countess 
was 
pleased 
with 
Natasha's 
zeal; 
after 
the 
poor 
results 
of
the 
medical 
treatment, 
in 
the 
depths 
of 
her 
heart 
she 
hoped 
that 
prayer
might 
help 
her 
daughter 
more 
than 
medicines 
and, 
though 
not 
without
fear 
and<p>
concealing 
it 
from 
the 
doctor, 
she 
agreed 
to 
Natasha's 
wish 
and
entrusted 
her 
to 
Belova. 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna 
used 
to 
come 
to 
wake 
Natasha
at 
three 
in 
the 
morning, 
but 
generally 
found 
her 
already 
awake. 
She 
was
afraid 
of 
being 
late 
for 
Matins. 
Hastily 
washing, 
and 
meekly 
putting 
on
her 
shabbiest 
dress 
and 
an 
old 
mantilla, 
Natasha, 
shivering 
in 
the 
fresh
air, 
went 
out 
into 
the 
deserted 
streets 
lit 
by 
the 
clear 
light 
of 
dawn.
By 
Agrafena 
Ivanovna's 
advice 
Natasha 
prepared 
herself 
not 
in 
their
own 
parish, 
but 
at 
a 
church 
where, 
according 
to 
the 
devout 
Agrafena
Ivanovna, 
the 
priest 
was 
a 
man 
of 
very 
severe 
and 
lofty 
life. 
There 
were
never 
many 
people 
in 
the 
church; 
Natasha 
always 
stood 
beside 
Belova 
in
the 
customary 
place 
before 
an 
icon 
of 
the 
Blessed 
Virgin, 
let 
into 
the
screen 
before 
the 
choir 
on 
the 
left 
side, 
and 
a 
feeling, 
new 
to 
her, 
of
humility 
before 
something 
great 
and 
incomprehensible, 
seized 
her 
when
at 
that 
unusual 
morning 
hour, 
gazing 
at 
the 
dark 
face 
of 
the 
Virgin
illuminated 
by 
the 
candles 
burning 
before 
it 
and 
by 
the 
morning 
light
falling 
from 
the 
window, 
she 
listened 
to 
the 
words 
of 
the

she 
tried 
to 
follow 
with 
understanding.

senseless,

impossible.

It 
was<p>
impossible 
first 
because-as 
experience 
shows 
that 
a 
three-mile
movement 
of 
columns 
on 
a 
battlefield 
never 
coincides 
with 
the 
plans-the
probability 
of 
Chichagov, 
Kutuzov, 
and 
Wittgenstein 
effecting 
a 
junction
on 
time 
at 
an 
appointed 
place 
was 
so 
remote 
as 
to 
be 
tantamount 
to
impossibility, 
as 
in 
fact 
thought 
Kutuzov, 
who 
when 
he 
received 
the 
plan
remarked 
that 
diversions 
planned 
over 
great 
distances 
do 
not 
<a href="/cZl/qK5mM4pXQvm.html">yield</a> 
the
desired 
results.

Secondly 
it 
was 
impossible, 
because 
to 
paralyze 
the 
momentum 
with 
which
Napoleon's 
army 
was 
retiring, 
incomparably 
greater 
forces 
than 
the
Russians 
possessed 
would 
have 
been 
required.

Thirdly 
it 
was 
impossible, 
because 
the 
military 
term 
"to 
cut 
off" 
has 
no
meaning. 
One 
can 
cut 
off 
a 
slice 
of 
bread, 
but 
not 
an 
army. 
To 
cut 
off
an 
army-to 
bar 
its 
road-is 
quite 
impossible, 
for 
there 
is 
always 
plenty
of 
room 
to 
avoid 
capture 
and 
there 
is 
the 
night 
when 
nothing 
can 
be
seen, 
as 
the 
military 
scientists 
might 
convince 
themselves 
by 
the
example 
of 
Krasnoe 
and 
of 
the 
Berezina. 
It 
is 
only 
possible 
to 
capture
prisoners 
if 
they 
agree 
to 
be 
captured, 
just 
as 
it 
is 
only 
possible
to 
catch 
a 
swallow 
if 
it 
settles 
on 
one's 
hand. 
Men 
can 
only 
be 
taken
prisoners 
if 
they 
surrender 
according 
to 
the 
rules 
of 
strategy 
and
tactics, 
as 
the 
Germans 
did. 
But 
the 
French 
troops 
quite 
rightly 
did 
not
consider 
that 
this 
suited 
them, 
since 
death 
by 
hunger 
and 
cold 
awaited
them 
in 
flight 
or 
captivity 
alike.

Fourthly 
and 
chiefly 
it 
was 
impossible, 
because 
never 
since 
the 
world
began 
has 
a 
war 
been 
fought 
under 
such 
conditions 
as 
those 
that 
obtained
in 
1812, 
and 
the 
Russian 
army 
in 
its 
pursuit 
of 
the 
French 
strained 
its
strength 
to 
the 
utmost 
and 
could 
not 
have 
done 
more 
without 
destroying
itself.

During 
the 
movement 
of 
the 
Russian 
army 
from 
Tarutino 
to 
Krasnoe 
it
lost 
fifty 
thousand 
sick 
or 
stragglers, 
that 
is 
a 
number 
equal 
to<p>
the
population 
of 
a 
large 
provincial 
town. 
Half 
the 
men 
fell 
out 
of 
the 
army
without 
a 
battle.

And 
it 
is 
of 
this 
period 
of 
the 
campaign-when 
the 
army 
lacked 
boots
and 
sheepskin 
coats, 
was 
short 
of 
provisions 
and 
without 
vodka, 
and
was 
camping 
out 
at 
night 
for 
months 
in 
the 
snow 
with 
fifteen 
degrees
of 
frost, 
when 
there 
were 
only 
seven 
or 
eight 
hours 
of 
daylight 
and
the 
rest 
was 
night 
in 
which 
the 
influence 
of 
discipline 
cannot 
be
maintained, 
when 
men 
were 
taken 
into 
that 
region 
of 
death 
where
discipline 
fails, 
not 
for<p>
a 
few 
hours 
only 
as 
in 
a 
battle, 
but 
for
months, 
where 
they 
were 
every 
moment 
fighting 
death 
from 
hunger 
and
cold, 
when 
half 
the 
army 
perished 
in 
a 
single 
month-it 
is 
of 
this<p>
period
of 
the 
campaign 
that 
the 
historians 
tell 
us 
how 
Miloradovich 
should 
have
made 
a 
flank 
march 
to 
such 
and 
such 
a 
place, 
Tormasov 
to 
another

and 
Chichagov 
should 
have 
crossed 
(more 
than 
knee-deep 
in 
snow) 
to
somewhere 
else, 
and 
how 
so-and-so 
"routed" 
and

the 
French 
and

Hills 
were 
visible 
in 
the 
distance,
with 
the 
village, 
the 
church, 
and 
the 
large 
white 
house. 
The 
bare 
trees,
the 
sand, 
the

roofs 
of

houses, 
the 
green 
church 
spire,

the

occupied 
by 
the

with 
lilac 
bushes 
still 
showing 
dark 
green
beside 
the

And 
even 
that 
ruined

befouled

in 
dull
weather 
was 
repulsively 
ugly-seemed 
quietly 
beautiful 
now, 
in 
the 
clear,
motionless 
brilliance.

A 
French 
corporal, 
with 
coat 
unbuttoned 
in 
a 
homely 
way,<p>
a 
skullcap 
on
his 
head, 
and 
a 
short 
pipe 
in 
his 
mouth, 
came 
from 
behind 
a 
corner 
of
the 
shed 
and 
approached 
Pierre 
with 
a 
friendly 
wink.

"What 
sunshine, 
Monsieur 
Kiril!" 
(Their 
name 
for 
Pierre.) 
"Eh? 
Just 
like
spring!"

And 
the 
corporal 
leaned 
against 
the 
door 
and 
offered 
Pierre 
his 
pipe,
though 
whenever 
he 
offered 
it 
Pierre 
always 
declined 
it.

"To 
be 
on 
the 
march 
in 
such 
weather..." 
he 
began.

Pierre 
inquired 
what 
was 
being 
said 
about 
leaving, 
and 
the 
corporal 
told
him 
that 
nearly 
all 
the 
troops 
were 
starting 
and 
there 
ought 
to 
be 
an
order 
about 
the 
prisoners 
that 
day. 
Sokolov, 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers 
in 
the
shed 
with 
Pierre, 
was 
dying, 
and 
Pierre 
told 
the 
corporal 
that 
something
should 
be 
done 
about 
him. 
The 
corporal 
replied 
that 
Pierre 
need 
not
worry 
about 
that 
as 
they 
had 
an 
ambulance 
and 
a 
permanent 
hospital 
and

for

sick, 
and 
that

that 
could

had 
been 
foreseen 
by 
the 
authorities.

"Besides, 
Monsieur 
Kiril, 
you 
have 
only 
to 
say 
a 
word 
to 
the 
captain,
you 
know. 
He 
is 
a 
man 
who 
never 
forgets 
anything. 
Speak 
to 
the 
captain
when 
he 
makes 
his 
round, 
he 
will 
do 
anything 
for 
you."

(The 
captain 
of 
whom 
the 
corporal 
spoke 
often 
had 
long 
chats 
with 
Pierre
and 
showed 
him 
all 
sorts 
of 
favors.)

"'You 
see, 
St. 
Thomas,' 
he 
said 
to 
me 
the 
other 
day. 
'Monsieur 
Kiril 
is
a 
man 
of 
education, 
who 
speaks 
French. 
He 
is 
a 
Russian 
seigneur 
who 
has
had 
misfortunes, 
but 
he 
is 
a 
man. 
He 
knows 
what's 
what.... 
If 
he 
wants
anything 
and 
asks 
me, 
he 
won't 
get 
a 
refusal. 
When 
one 
has 
studied, 
you
see, 
one 
likes 
education 
and 
well-bred 
people.' 
It 
is 
for 
your 
sake 
I
mention 
it, 
Monsieur 
Kiril. 
The 
other 
day 
if 
it 
had 
not 
been 
for 
you
that 
affair 
would 
have 
ended 
ill."

And 
after 
chatting 
a 
while 
longer, 
the 
corporal 
went 
away. 
(The 
affair
he 
had 
alluded 
to 
had 
<a href="/cZl/Xo8fnBp1EPTad8Cr.html">happened</a> 
a 
few 
days 
before-a 
fight 
between 
the
prisoners 
and 
the 
French 
soldiers, 
in 
which 
Pierre 
had 
succeeded 
in
pacifying 
his 
comrades.) 
Some 
of 
the 
prisoners 
who 
had 
heard 
Pierre
talking 
to 
the 
corporal 
immediately 
asked 
what 
the 
Frenchman 
had 
said.
While 
Pierre 
was 
repeating 
what 
he 
had 
been 
told 
about 
the 
army 
leaving
Moscow, 
a 
thin, 
sallow,

the 
Pavlograd 
regiment, 
in 
which
he 
already 
commanded 
the 
squadron 
he 
had 
taken 
over 
from 
Denisov.

Rostov 
had 
become 
a 
bluff, 
good-natured 
fellow, 
whom 
his 
Moscow
acquaintances 
would 
have 
considered 
rather 
bad 
form, 
but 
who 
was 
liked
and 
respected 
by 
his 
comrades, 
subordinates, 
and 
superiors, 
and 
was 
well
contented 
with 
his 
life. 
Of 
late, 
in 
1809, 
he 
found 
in 
letters 
from 
home
more 
frequent 
complaints 
from 
his 
mother 
that 
their 
affairs 
were 
falling
into 
greater 
and 
greater 
disorder, 
and 
that 
it 
was 
time 
for 
him 
to 
come
back 
to 
gladden 
and 
comfort 
his 
old 
parents.

Reading 
these 
letters, 
Nicholas 
felt 
a 
dread 
of 
their 
wanting 
to
take 
him 
away 
from 
surroundings 
in 
which, 
protected 
from 
all<p>
the
entanglements 
of 
life, 
he 
was 
living 
so 
calmly 
and 
quietly. 
He 
felt 
that
sooner 
or 
later 
he 
would 
have 
to 
re-enter 
that 
whirlpool 
of 
life, 
with
its 
embarrassments 
and 
affairs 
to 
be 
straightened 
out, 
its 
accounts
with 
stewards, 
quarrels, 
and 
intrigues, 
its 
ties, 
society, 
and 
with
Sonya's 
love 
and 
his 
promise 
to 
her. 
It 
was 
all 
dreadfully 
difficult
and 
complicated; 
and 
he 
replied 
to 
his 
mother 
in 
cold, 
formal 
letters
in 
French, 
beginning: 
"My 
dear 
Mamma," 
and 
ending: 
"Your 
obedient
son," 
which 
said 
nothing 
of 
when 
he 
would 
return. 
In 
1810 
he 
received
letters 
from 
his 
parents, 
in 
which 
they 
told<p>
him 
of 
Natasha's
engagement 
to 
Bolkonski, 
and 
that 
the 
wedding 
would 
be 
in 
a 
year's
time 
because 
the 
old 
prince 
made 
difficulties. 
This 
letter 
grieved 
and
mortified 
Nicholas. 
In 
the 
first 
place 
he 
was 
sorry 
that 
Natasha, 
for
whom 
he 
cared 
more 
than 
for 
anyone 
else 
in 
the 
family, 
should 
be 
lost 
to
the 
home; 
and 
secondly, 
from 
his 
hussar 
point 
of 
view, 
he 
regretted 
not
to 
have 
been 
there 
to 
show 
that 
fellow 
Bolkonski 
that 
connection 
with
him 
was 
no 
such 
great 
honor 
after 
all, 
and 
that 
if 
he 
loved 
Natasha 
he
might 
dispense 
with 
permission 
from 
his 
dotard 
father. 
For 
a 
moment 
he
hesitated 
whether 
he 
should 
not 
apply 
for 
leave 
in 
order 
to 
see 
Natasha
before 
she 
was 
married, 
but 
then 
came 
the 
maneuvers, 
and 
considerations
about 
Sonya 
and 
about 
the 
confusion 
of 
their 
affairs, 
and 
Nicholas
again 
put 
it 
off. 
But 
in 
the<p>
spring 
of 
that 
year, 
he 
received 
a 
letter
from 
his 
mother, 
written 
without 
his 
father's 
knowledge, 
and 
that
letter 
persuaded 
him 
to 
return. 
She 
wrote 
that

he 
did 
not 
come 
and
take

the

narrowly
intelligent,

and 
pedantic 
preceptor. 
The 
old 
prince
had 
changed 
in 
appearance 
only 
by 
the 
loss 
of 
a 
tooth, 
which 
left 
a
noticeable 
gap<p>
on 
one 
side 
of 
his 
mouth; 
in 
character 
he 
was 
the 
same 
as
ever, 
only 
showing 
still 
more 
irritability 
and 
skepticism 
as 
to 
what 
was
happening 
in 
the 
world. 
Little 
Nicholas 
alone 
had 
changed. 
He 
had 
grown,
become 
rosier, 
had 
curly 
dark 
hair, 
and, 
when 
merry 
and 
laughing, 
quite
unconsciously 
lifted 
the 
upper 
lip 
of 
his 
pretty 
little 
mouth 
just
as 
the 
little 
princess 
used 
to 
do. 
He 
alone 
did 
not 
obey 
the 
law 
of
immutability 
in 
the 
enchanted, 
sleeping 
castle. 
But 
though<p>
externally
all 
remained 
as 
of 
old, 
the 
inner 
relations 
of 
all 
these 
people 
had
changed 
since 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
seen 
them<p>
last. 
The 
household 
was
divided 
into 
two 
alien 
and 
hostile 
camps, 
who 
changed 
their 
habits 
for
his 
sake 
and 
only 
met 
because 
he 
was 
there. 
To 
the 
one 
camp 
belonged
the 
old 
prince, 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
and 
the 
architect; 
to 
the 
other
Princess 
Mary, 
Dessalles, 
little 
Nicholas, 
and 
all 
the 
old 
nurses 
and
maids.

During 
his 
stay 
at 
Bald 
Hills 
all 
the 
family 
dined 
together, 
but 
they
were 
ill 
at 
ease 
and 
Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
that 
he 
was 
a 
visitor 
for 
whose
sake 
an 
exception 
was 
being 
made 
and 
that 
his 
presence 
made 
them 
all
feel 
awkward. 
Involuntarily 
feeling 
this 
at 
dinner 
on 
the 
first 
day, 
he
was 
taciturn, 
and 
the 
old 
prince 
noticing 
this 
also 
became 
morosely 
dumb
and 
retired 
to 
his 
apartments 
directly 
after 
dinner. 
In<p>
the 
evening,
when 
Prince 
Andrew 
went 
to 
him 
and, 
trying 
to 
rouse 
him, 
began 
to
tell 
him 
of 
the 
young 
Count 
Kamensky's 
campaign, 
the 
old 
prince
began 
unexpectedly 
to 
talk 
about 
Princess 
Mary, 
blaming 
her 
for 
her
superstitions 
and 
her 
dislike 
of 
Mademoiselle 
Bourienne, 
who, 
he 
said,
was 
the 
only 
person 
really 
attached 
to 
him.

The 
old 
prince 
said 
that 
if 
he 
was 
ill 
it 
was 
only 
because 
of 
Princess
Mary: 
that 
she 
purposely 
worried 
and 
irritated 
him, 
and

indulgence

"I

answered 
Anatole 
continuing

"Come! 
Balaga

Anatole 
rose 
and 
went 
into 
the 
dining 
room. 
Balaga 
was 
a 
famous 
troyka
driver 
who 
had 
known 
Dolokhov 
and 
Anatole 
some 
six 
years 
and 
had 
given
them 
good 
service 
with 
his 
troykas. 
More 
than 
once 
when 
Anatole's
regiment 
was 
stationed 
at 
Tver 
he 
had 
taken 
him 
from 
Tver 
in 
the
evening, 
brought 
him 
to 
Moscow 
by 
daybreak, 
and 
driven 
him 
back 
again
the 
next 
night. 
More 
than 
once 
he 
had 
enabled 
Dolokhov 
to 
escape 
when
pursued. 
More 
than 
once 
he 
had 
driven 
them 
through 
the<p>
town 
with 
gypsies
and 
"ladykins" 
as 
he 
called 
the 
cocottes. 
More 
than 
once 
in 
their
service 
he 
had 
run 
over 
pedestrians 
and 
upset 
vehicles 
in 
the 
streets
of 
Moscow 
and 
had 
always 
been 
protected 
from 
the 
consequences 
by 
"my
gentlemen" 
as 
he 
called 
them. 
He 
had 
ruined 
more 
than 
one 
horse 
in
their 
service. 
More 
than 
once 
they 
had 
beaten 
him, 
and 
more 
than 
once
they 
had 
made 
him 
drunk 
on 
champagne 
and 
Madeira, 
which 
he 
loved; 
and
he 
knew 
more 
than 
one 
thing 
about 
each 
of 
them 
which 
would 
long 
ago 
have
sent 
an 
ordinary 
man 
to 
Siberia. 
They 
often 
called 
Balaga 
into 
their
orgies 
and 
made 
him 
drink 
and 
dance 
at 
the 
gypsies', 
and 
more 
than 
one
thousand 
rubles 
of 
their 
money 
had 
passed 
through 
his 
hands. 
In 
their
service 
he 
risked 
his 
skin 
and 
his 
life 
twenty 
times 
a 
year, 
and 
in
their 
service 
had 
lost 
more 
horses 
than 
the 
money 
he 
had 
from 
them 
would
buy. 
But<p>
he 
liked 
them; 
liked 
that 
mad 
driving 
at 
twelve 
miles 
an 
hour,
liked 
upsetting 
a 
driver 
or 
running 
down 
a 
pedestrian, 
and 
flying 
at
full 
gallop 
through 
the 
Moscow 
streets. 
He 
liked 
to 
hear 
those 
wild,
tipsy 
shouts 
behind 
him: 
"Get 
on! 
Get 
on!" 
when 
it 
was 
impossible
to 
go 
any 
faster. 
He 
liked 
giving 
a 
painful 
lash 
on 
the 
neck 
to 
some
peasant 
who, 
more 
dead 
than 
alive, 
was 
already 
hurrying 
out 
of 
his 
way.
"Real 
gentlemen!" 
he 
considered 
them.

Anatole 
and 
Dolokhov 
liked 
Balaga 
too<p>
for 
his 
masterly 
driving 
and
because 
he 
liked 
the 
things 
they 
liked. 
With 
others 
Balaga 
bargained,
charging 
twenty-five 
rubles 
for 
a 
two 
hours' 
drive, 
and 
rarely
drove 
himself, 
generally 
letting 
his 
young 
men 
do 
so. 
But 
with 
"his
gentlemen" 
he 
always 
drove 
himself 
and 
never 
demanded 
anything 
for
his 
work. 
Only 
a 
couple 
of 
times 
a 
year-when 
he 
knew 
from 
their 
valets
that 
they 
had 
money 
in 
hand-he 
would 
turn 
up 
of 
a 
morning 
quite 
sober
and 
with 
a 
deep 
bow 
would 
ask 
them 
to 
help 
him. 
The 
gentlemen 
always
made 
him 
sit 
down.

"Do 
help 
me 
out, 
Theodore 
Ivanych, 
sir," 
or 
"your 
excellency,"
he 
would 
say. 
"I 
am 
quite<p>
out 
of 
horses. 
Let 
me 
have 
what 
you 
can 
to
go 
to 
the 
fair."

And 
Anatole 
and 
Dolokhov, 
when 
they 
had 
money, 
would 
give 
him 
a
thousand 
or<p>
a 
couple 
of 
thousand 
rubles.

Balaga 
was 
a 
fair-haired, 
short, 
and 
snub-nosed 
peasant 
of 
about
twenty-seven; 
red-faced, 
with 
a 
particularly 
red 
thick 
neck, 
glittering
little 
eyes, 
and 
a 
small 
beard. 
He 
wore

the

increased, 
dispersed,
re-formed,

then 
moved 
with 
a 
hum 
of 
talk 
into 
the 
largest 
hall 
and
to 
the 
big 
table. 
Not 
only 
was 
Pierre's 
attempt 
to 
speak 
unsuccessful,
but 
he 
was 
rudely 
interrupted, 
pushed 
aside, 
and 
people 
turned 
away
from 
him 
as 
from 
a 
common 
enemy. 
This 
happened 
not 
because 
they 
were
displeased 
by 
the 
substance 
of 
his 
speech, 
which 
had 
even 
been 
forgotten
after 
the 
many 
subsequent 
speeches, 
but 
to 
animate 
it 
the 
crowd 
needed 
a
tangible 
object 
to 
love 
and 
a 
tangible 
object 
to 
hate. 
Pierre 
became 
the
latter. 
Many 
other 
orators 
spoke 
after 
the 
excited 
nobleman, 
and 
all 
in
the 
same 
tone. 
Many 
spoke 
eloquently 
and 
with 
originality.

Glinka, 
the 
editor 
of 
the 
Russian 
Messenger, 
who 
was 
recognized 
(cries
of 
"author! 
author!" 
were 
heard 
in 
the 
crowd), 
said 
that 
"hell 
must 
be
repulsed 
by 
hell," 
and 
that 
he 
had 
seen 
a 
child 
smiling 
at 
lightning
flashes 
and 
thunderclaps, 
but 
"we 
will 
not 
be 
that 
child."

"Yes, 
yes, 
at 
thunderclaps!" 
was 
repeated 
approvingly 
in 
the 
back 
rows
of 
the 
crowd.

The 
crowd 
drew 
up 
to 
the 
large 
table, 
at 
which 
sat 
gray-haired 
or 
bald
seventy-year-old 
magnates, 
uniformed 
and 
besashed, 
almost 
all 
of 
whom
Pierre 
had 
seen 
in 
their 
own 
homes 
with 
their 
buffoons, 
or 
playing
boston 
at 
the 
clubs. 
With 
an 
incessant 
hum 
of 
voices 
the 
crowd 
advanced
to 
the 
table. 
Pressed 
by 
the 
throng 
against 
the 
high 
backs 
of 
the
chairs, 
the 
orators 
spoke 
one 
after 
another 
and 
sometimes 
two 
together.
Those 
standing 
behind 
noticed 
what 
a 
speaker 
omitted 
to 
say 
and 
hastened
to 
supply 
it. 
Others 
in 
that 
heat 
and 
crush 
racked 
their 
brains 
to 
find
some 
thought 
and 
hastened 
to 
utter 
it. 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Dt17xHdu3.html">The</a> 
old 
magnates, 
whom 
Pierre
knew, 
sat 
and 
turned 
to 
look 
first 
at 
one

then 
at 
another, 
and 
their
faces 
for 
the 
most 
part 
only 
expressed 
the 
fact 
that 
they 
found 
it 
very
hot. 
Pierre, 
however, 
felt 
excited, 
and 
the 
general 
desire 
to 
show 
that
they 
were 
ready 
to 
go 
to 
all 
lengths-which 
found 
expression 
in 
the 
tones
and 
looks 
more 
than 
in 
the 
substance 
of 
the 
speeches-infected 
him 
too.
He 
did 
not 
renounce 
his 
opinions, 
but 
felt 
himself 
in 
some 
way 
to 
blame
and 
wished 
to 
justify 
himself.

"I 
only 
said 
that 
it 
would 
be 
more 
to 
the 
purpose 
to 
make 
sacrifices
when 
we 
know 
what

<a href="/cZl/al5bOIDr0VWVhi1U.html">said</a> 
he, 
trying 
to 
be 
heard 
above 
the
other 
voices.

One 
of 
the 
old 
men 
nearest 
to 
him 
looked 
round, 
but 
his 
attention 
was
immediately 
diverted 
by 
an 
exclamation 
at 
the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
table.

"Yes, 
Moscow 
will 
be 
surrendered! 
She 
will 
be 
our 
expiation!" 
shouted
one 
man.

"He 
is 
the 
enemy 
<a href="/cZl/YN55W0.html">of</a> 
mankind!" 
cried 
another. 
"Allow 
me 
to 
speak...."
"Gentlemen, 
you 
are 
crushing 
me!..."

distance 
than 
they 
had 
already 
traversed, 
before

This 
longing 
to 
distinguish 
themselves, 
to 
maneuver, 
to 
overthrow, 
and
to 
cut 
off 
showed 
itself 
particularly 
whenever 
the 
Russians 
stumbled 
on
the 
French 
army.

So 
it 
was 
at 
Krasnoe, 
where 
they 
expected 
to 
find 
one 
of 
the 
three
French 
columns 
and 
stumbled 
instead 
on 
Napoleon 
himself 
with 
sixteen
thousand 
men. 
Despite 
all 
Kutuzov's 
efforts 
to 
avoid 
that 
ruinous
encounter 
and 
to 
preserve 
his 
troops, 
the 
massacre 
of 
the 
broken 
mob
of 
French 
soldiers 
by 
worn-out 
Russians 
continued 
at 
Krasnoe 
for 
three
days.

Toll 
wrote 
a 
disposition: 
"The 
first 
column 
will 
march 
to 
so 
and 
so,"
etc. 
And 
as 
usual 
nothing 
happened 
in 
accord 
with 
the 
disposition.
Prince 
Eugene 
of 
Wuerttemberg 
fired 
from 
a 
hill 
over 
the 
French 
crowds
that 
were 
running 
past, 
and 
demanded 
reinforcements 
which 
did 
not
arrive. 
The 
French, 
avoiding 
the 
Russians, 
dispersed 
and 
hid 
themselves
in 
the 
forest 
by 
night, 
making 
their 
way 
round 
as 
best 
they 
could, 
and
continued 
their 
flight.

Miloradovich, 
who 
said 
he 
did 
not 
want 
to 
know 
anything 
about 
the
commissariat 
affairs 
of 
his 
detachment,

never

he 
was 
wanted-that

as 
he 
styled
himself-who 
was 
fond 
of 
parleys 
with 
the 
French, 
sent 
envoys 
demanding
their 
surrender, 
wasted 
time, 
and 
did 
not

what 
he 
was 
ordered 
to 
do.

Knight 
without 
fear 
and 
without

"I 
give 
you 
that 
column, 
lads," 
he 
said, 
riding 
up 
to 
the 
troops 
and
pointing 
out 
the 
French 
to 
the 
cavalry.

And 
the 
cavalry, 
with 
spurs 
and 
sabers 
urging 
on 
horses 
that 
could
scarcely 
move, 
trotted 
with 
much 
effort 
to 
the 
column 
presented
to 
them-that 
is 
to 
say, 
to 
a 
crowd 
of 
Frenchmen 
stark 
with 
cold,
frost-bitten, 
and 
starving-and 
the 
column 
that 
had 
been 
presented 
to
them 
threw 
down 
its 
arms 
and 
surrendered 
as 
it 
had 
long 
been 
anxious 
to
do.

At 
Krasnoe 
they 
took 
twenty-six 
thousand 
prisoners, 
several 
hundred
cannon, 
and 
a 
stick 
called 
a 
"marshal's 
staff," 
and 
disputed 
as 
to 
who
had 
distinguished 
himself 
and 
were 
pleased 
with 
their 
achievement-though
they 
much 
regretted 
not<p>
having 
taken 
Napoleon, 
or 
at 
least 
a 
marshal 
or
a 
hero 
of 
some 
sort,

one 
another

especially 
Kutuzov
for 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/eQ1YyaBP2tQI5Qz.html">having</a>

considered

heroes 
and
imagined 
that 
they 
were 
accomplishing 
a 
most 
noble 
and

deed. 
They 
blamed 
Kutuzov 
and 
said 
that

the

the

he 
had

his

not

Linen
Factories

at 
Krasnoe 
he 
checked

there 
he 
had

understanding
with 
Napoleon 
and 
had 
been 
bribed 
by 
him,

so 
on, 
and 
so 
on.

his

conviction 
that 
she 
would

But

"Lise,

said 
Prince

still 
more
emphatically.

Pierre, 
who 
had 
been 
growing 
more 
and 
more 
agitated 
as 
he 
listened 
to
all 
this, 
rose 
and 
approached 
the 
princess. 
He 
seemed 
unable 
to 
bear 
the
sight 
of 
tears 
and 
was 
ready 
to 
cry 
himself.

"Calm

Prince 
Andrew 
caught 
him 
by 
the 
hand.

"No,

"No,

"Lise!"

Prince 
Andrew 
dryly, 
raising 
his 
voice 
to 
the 
pitch

indicates 
that

is 
exhausted.

Suddenly 
the 
angry,

expression 
of

changed 
into 
a

the 
newly

his 
ears 
tingle.

When 
he 
came 
to 
himself 
he 
was 
sitting 
on 
the 
ground 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ow92Npkec1tA.html">leaning</a> 
on 
his
hands; 
the 
ammunition 
wagons 
he 
had 
been 
approaching 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/kZ4fOHvf2WG6GdRBS.html">no</a> 
longer 
existed,
only 
charred 
green 
boards 
and 
rags 
littered 
the 
scorched 
grass, 
and 
a
horse, 
dangling 
fragments 
of 
its 
shaft 
behind 
<a href="/cZl/yM6hBn8ikR7JByLm.html">it,</a> 
galloped 
past, 
while
another 
horse

the 
ground, 
uttering

and
piercing 
cries.





CHAPTER 
XXXII

Beside 
himself 
with 
terror 
Pierre 
jumped 
up 
and 
ran 
back 
to 
the 
battery,
as 
to 
the 
only 
refuge 
from 
the 
horrors 
that 
surrounded 
him.

On 
entering 
the 
earthwork 
he 
noticed 
that 
there 
were 
men 
doing 
something
there 
but 
that 
no 
shots 
were 
being 
fired 
from 
the 
battery. 
He 
had 
no
time 
to 
realize 
who 
these 
men 
were. 
He 
saw 
the 
senior 
officer 
lying 
on
the 
<a href="/cZl/ND8byQW61INH.html">earth</a> 
wall 
with 
his 
back 
turned 
as 
if 
he 
were 
examining 
something
down 
below 
and 
that 
one 
of 
the 
soldiers 
he 
had 
noticed 
before 
was
struggling 
forward 
shouting 
"Brothers!" 
and 
trying 
to 
free 
himself 
from
some<p>
men 
who 
were 
holding 
him 
by 
the 
arm. 
He 
also 
saw 
something 
else
that 
was 
strange.

But 
he 
had 
not 
time 
to 
realize 
that 
the 
colonel 
had 
been 
killed, 
that
the 
soldier 
shouting 
"Brothers!" 
was 
a 
prisoner, 
and 
that 
another 
man
had 
been 
bayoneted 
in 
the 
back 
before<p>
his 
eyes, 
for 
hardly 
had 
he 
run
into 
the 
redoubt 
before 
a 
thin, 
sallow-faced, 
perspiring 
man 
in 
a 
blue
uniform 
rushed 
on 
him 
sword 
in 
hand, 
shouting 
something. 
Instinctively

against

around

(His

"I

He 
embraced 
his 
daughter, 
and 
then 
again 
Pierre, 
and 
kissed 
him 
with 
his
malodorous 
mouth. 
Tears 
actually 
moistened 
his 
cheeks.

"Princess, 
come 
here!" 
he 
shouted.

The 
old 
princess 
came 
in 
and 
also 
wept. 
The 
elderly 
lady 
was 
using
her 
handkerchief 
too. 
Pierre 
was 
kissed, 
and 
he 
kissed 
the 
beautiful
Helene's 
hand 
several 
times. 
After 
a 
while 
they 
were 
left 
alone
again.

"All 
this 
had 
to 
be 
and 
could 
not 
be 
otherwise," 
thought 
Pierre,
"so 
it 
is 
useless 
to 
ask 
whether 
it 
is 
good 
or 
bad. 
It 
is 
good 
because
it's 
definite 
and 
one 
is 
rid 
of 
the 
old 
tormenting 
doubt." 
Pierre
held 
the 
hand 
of 
his 
betrothed 
in 
silence, 
looking 
at 
her 
beautiful
bosom 
as 
it 
rose 
and 
fell.

"Helene!" 
he 
said 
aloud 
and 
paused.

"Something 
special 
is 
always 
said 
in 
such 
cases," 
he 
thought, 
but
could 
not 
remember 
what 
it 
was 
that 
people 
say. 
He 
looked 
at 
her 
face.
She 
drew 
nearer 
to 
him. 
Her 
face 
flushed.

"Oh, 
take 
those 
off... 
those..." 
she 
said, 
pointing 
to 
his
spectacles.

Pierre 
took 
them 
off, 
and 
his 
eyes, 
besides 
the 
strange 
look 
eyes 
have
from 
which 
spectacles<p>
have 
just 
been 
removed, 
had 
also 
a 
frightened 
and
inquiring 
look. 
He 
was 
about 
to 
stoop 
over 
her 
hand 
and 
kiss 
it, 
but
with 
a 
rapid, 
almost 
brutal 
movement 
of 
her 
head, 
she 
intercepted 
his
lips 
and 
met 
them 
with 
her 
own. 
Her<p>
face 
struck 
Pierre, 
by 
its 
altered,
unpleasantly 
excited 
expression.

"It 
is 
too 
late 
now, 
it's 
done; 
besides 
I 
love 
her," 
thought
Pierre.

"Je 
vous 
aime!" 
* 
he 
said, 
remembering 
what 
has 
to 
be 
said 
at 
such
moments: 
but 
his 
words 
sounded 
so 
weak 
that 
he 
felt 
ashamed 
of 
himself.

"I

Six 
weeks 
later

was

settled 
in

Bezukhov's
large, 
newly

Petersburg

the

CHAPTER 
III

Old 
Prince 
Nicholas 
Bolkonski 
received 
a 
letter 
from 
Prince 
Vasili
in 
November, 
1805, 
announcing 
that 
he 
and 
his 
son 
would 
be 
paying 
him
a 
visit. 
"I 
am 
starting 
on 
a 
journey 
of 
inspection, 
and 
of 
course 
I
shall 
think 
nothing 
of 
an 
extra 
seventy 
miles 
to 
come 
and 
see 
you 
at
the 
same 
time, 
my 
honored 
benefactor," 
wrote 
Prince 
Vasili. 
"My 
son
Anatole 
is 
accompanying 
me 
on 
his 
way 
to 
the 
army, 
so 
I 
hope 
you 
will
allow 
him 
personally 
to 
express 
the 
deep 
respect 
that, 
emulating 
his
father, 
he 
feels 
for 
you."

"It 
seems 
that 
there<p>
will 
be 
no 
need 
to<p>
bring 
Mary 
out, 
suitors 
are
coming 
to 
us 
of 
their 
own 
accord," 
incautiously 
remarked 
the 
little
princess 
on 
hearing 
the 
news.

Prince 
Nicholas 
frowned, 
but 
said 
nothing.

A 
fortnight 
after 
the 
letter 
Prince 
Vasili's 
servants 
came 
one
evening 
in 
advance 
of 
him, 
and 
he 
and 
his 
son 
arrived 
next 
day.

Old 
Bolkonski 
had<p>
always 
had 
a 
poor 
opinion 
of 
Prince 
Vasili's
character, 
but 
more 
so 
recently, 
since 
in 
the 
new 
reigns 
of 
Paul 
and
Alexander 
Prince 
Vasili 
had 
risen 
to 
high 
position 
and 
honors. 
And 
now,
from 
the 
hints 
contained 
in 
his 
letter 
and 
given 
by 
the 
little 
princess,
he 
saw 
which 
way 
the 
wind 
was 
blowing,

"Why

I

Natasha, 
have 
you 
considered 
what 
these 
secret 
reasons 
can
be?"

Natasha 
looked 
at 
Sonya 
with 
astonishment. 
Evidently 
this 
question
presented 
itself 
to 
her 
mind 
for 
the 
first 
time 
and 
she 
did 
not 
know 
how
to 
answer 
it.

"I 
don't 
know 
what 
the 
reasons 
are. 
But 
there 
must 
be 
reasons!"

Sonya 
sighed 
and 
shook 
her 
head 
incredulously.

"If 
there 
were 
reasons..." 
she 
began.

But 
Natasha, 
guessing 
her 
doubts, 
interrupted 
her 
in 
alarm.

"Sonya, 
one 
can't 
doubt 
him! 
One 
can't, 
one 
can't! 
Don't 
you
understand?" 
she 
cried.

"Does 
he 
love 
you?"

"Does 
he 
love 
me?" 
Natasha 
repeated 
with 
a 
smile 
of 
pity 
at 
her
friend's 
lack 
of 
comprehension. 
"Why, 
you 
have 
read 
his 
letter<p>
and
you 
have 
seen 
him."

"But 
if 
he 
is 
dishonorable?"

"He! 
dishonorable? 
If 
you 
only 
knew!" 
exclaimed 
Natasha.

"If 
he 
is 
an 
honorable 
man 
he 
should 
either 
declare 
his 
intentions 
or
cease 
seeing 
you; 
and 
if 
you 
won't 
do 
this, 
I 
will. 
I 
will 
write 
to
him, 
and 
I 
will 
tell 
Papa!" 
said 
Sonya 
resolutely.

"But 
I 
can't 
live 
without 
him!" 
cried 
Natasha.

"Natasha, 
I 
don't 
understand 
you. 
And 
what 
are 
you 
saying! 
Think 
of
your 
father 
and 
of 
Nicholas."

"I 
don't 
want 
anyone, 
I 
don't 
love 
anyone 
but<p>
him. 
How 
dare 
you
say 
he 
is 
dishonorable? 
Don't 
you 
know 
that 
I 
love 
him?" 
screamed
Natasha. 
"Go 
away, 
Sonya! 
I 
don't 
want 
to 
quarrel 
with 
you, 
but
go, 
for 
God's 
sake 
go! 
You 
see 
how 
I 
am 
suffering!" 
Natasha 
cried
angrily, 
in 
a 
voice 
of 
despair 
and 
repressed 
irritation. 
Sonya 
burst
into 
sobs 
and 
ran 
from 
the 
room.

Natasha 
went 
to 
the 
table 
and 
without 
a 
moment's 
reflection 
wrote
that 
answer 
to 
Princess 
Mary 
which 
she 
had 
been 
unable 
to 
write 
all
the 
morning. 
In 
this 
letter 
she 
said 
briefly 
that 
all 
their
misunderstandings 
were 
at 
an 
end; 
that 
availing 
herself 
of 
the
magnanimity 
of 
Prince 
Andrew 
who 
when 
he 
went 
abroad 
had 
given 
her 
her
freedom, 
she 
begged 
Princess 
Mary 
to 
forget 
everything 
and 
forgive 
her
if 
she 
had 
been 
to 
blame 
toward 
her, 
but 
that 
she 
could 
not 
be 
his
wife. 
At 
that 
moment 
this 
all 
seemed 
quite 
easy, 
simple, 
and 
clear 
to
Natasha.


On 
Friday 
the 
Rostovs 
were 
to 
return 
to 
the 
country, 
but 
on 
Wednesday
the 
count 
went

his 
estate 
near 
Moscow.

CHAPTER 
IV

Prince 
Andrew 
arrived 
in 
Petersburg 
in 
August, 
1809. 
It 
was 
the 
time
when 
the 
youthful 
Speranski 
was 
at 
the 
zenith 
of 
his 
fame 
and 
his
reforms 
were 
being 
pushed 
forward 
with 
the 
greatest 
energy. 
That 
same
August 
the 
Emperor 
was 
thrown 
from 
his 
caleche, 
injured 
his 
leg, 
and
remained 
three 
weeks 
at 
Peterhof, 
receiving 
Speranski 
every 
day 
and 
no
one 
else. 
At 
that 
time 
the 
two 
famous 
decrees 
were 
being 
prepared
that 
so 
agitated 
society-abolishing 
court 
ranks 
and 
introducing
examinations 
to 
qualify 
for 
the 
grades 
of 
Collegiate 
Assessor 
<a href="/cZl/mf16LgATt.html">and
State</a> 
Councilor-and 
not 
merely 
these 
but 
<a href="/aVzUge/Eq19BwgT0.html">a</a>

intended 
to 
change

from

with 
the 
aid 
of 
his

The 
boy 
held 
on 
to 
the
hussar 
with 
cold, 
red 
hands, 
and 
raising 
his 
eyebrows 
gazed 
about 
him
with 
surprise. 
This<p>
was 
the 
French 
drummer 
boy 
captured 
that 
morning.

Behind 
them 
along 
the 
narrow, 
sodden, 
cut 
up 
forest 
road 
came 
hussars 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/ZLk8MCK3bju5WkvgW.html">in
threes</a> 
and 
fours, 
and 
then 
Cossacks: 
some 
in 
felt 
cloaks, 
some 
in 
French
greatcoats, 
and 
some 
with 
horsecloths 
over 
their 
heads. 
The 
horses,
being 
drenched 
by<p>
the 
rain, 
all 
looked 
black 
whether 
chestnut 
or 
bay.
Their 
necks, 
with 
their 
wet, 
close-clinging 
manes, 
looked 
strangely
thin. 
Steam 
rose 
from 
them. 
Clothes, 
saddles, 
reins, 
were 
all 
wet,
slippery, 
and 
sodden, 
like 
the 
ground 
and 
the 
fallen 
leaves 
that 
strewed
the 
road. 
The 
men 
sat 
huddled 
up 
trying 
not 
to 
stir, 
so 
as 
to 
warm 
the
water 
that 
had 
trickled 
to 
their 
bodies 
and 
not 
admit 
the 
fresh 
cold
water 
that 
was 
leaking 
in 
<a href="/aVzUge/zp4qQqw29HrxvL.html">under</a> 
their 
seats, 
their 
knees, 
and 
at 
the
back 
of 
their 
necks. 
In 
the 
midst 
of 
the 
outspread 
line 
of 
Cossacks 
two
wagons, 
drawn 
by 
French 
horses 
and 
by 
<a href="/cZl/Fm9vf18.html">saddled</a> 
Cossack 
horses 
that 
had
been 
hitched 
on 
in 
front, 
rumbled 
over 
the 
tree 
stumps 
and 
branches 
and
splashed 
through 
the 
water 
that 
lay 
in 
the 
ruts.

Denisov's 
horse 
swerved 
aside 
to 
avoid 
a 
pool 
in 
the 
track 
and 
bumped
his 
rider's 
knee 
against 
a 
tree.

"Oh, 
the 
devil!" 
exclaimed 
Denisov 
angrily, 
and 
showing 
his 
teeth 
he
struck 
his 
horse 
three 
times 
with 
his 
whip, 
splashing 
himself 
and 
his
comrades 
with 
mud.

Denisov 
was 
out 
of 
sorts 
both 
because 
of 
the 
rain 
and 
also 
from 
hunger
(none 
of 
them 
had 
eaten 
anything 
since 
morning), 
and<p>
yet 
more 
because 
he
still 
had 
no 
news 
from 
Dolokhov 
and 
the 
man 
sent 
to 
capture 
a 
"tongue"
had 
not 
returned.

"There'll 
hardly 
be 
another 
such 
chance 
to 
fall 
on 
a 
transport 
as 
today.
It's 
too 
risky 
to 
attack 
them 
by 
oneself, 
and 
if 
we 
put 
it 
off 
till
another 
day 
one 
of 
the 
big 
guerrilla 
detachments 
will 
snatch 
the 
prey
from 
under 
our 
noses," 
thought 
Denisov, 
continually 
peering 
forward,
hoping 
to 
see 
a 
messenger 
from 
Dolokhov.

On 
coming 
to 
a 
path 
in 
the 
forest 
along 
which 
he 
could 
see 
far 
to 
the
right, 
Denisov 
stopped.

"There's 
someone 
coming," 
said 
he.

The 
esaul 
looked 
in 
the 
direction

where 
the

was, 
the

shouts

thousands

voices. 
His 
horse 
and 
<a href="/aVzUge/JB3oqw19kK.html">the</a> 
horse 
of 
the 
hussar
near 
him 
pricked 
their 
ears 
at 
these 
shouts. 
Over 
there, 
where 
the
shouting 
came 
from, 
a 
fire 
flared 
up 
and 
went 
out 
again, 
then 
another,
and 
all 
along 
the 
French 
line 
on 
the 
hill 
fires 
flared 
up 
and 
the
shouting 
grew 
louder 
and 
louder. 
Rostov 
could 
hear 
the 
sound 
of 
French
words 
but 
could 
<a href="/cZl/mT2R8XKBx3.html">not</a> 
distinguish 
them. 
The 
din 
of 
many 
voices 
was 
too
great; 
all 
he 
could 
hear 
was: 
"ahahah!" 
and 
"rrrr!"

"What's 
that? 
What 
do 
you 
make 
of 
it?" 
said 
Rostov 
to 
the 
hussar
beside 
him. 
"That 
must 
be 
the 
enemy's 
camp!"

The 
hussar 
did 
not 
reply.

"Why, 
don't 
you 
hear 
it?" 
Rostov 
asked 
again, 
after 
waiting 
for 
a
reply.

"Who 
can 
tell, 
your 
honor?" 
replied 
the 
hussar 
reluctantly.

"From 
the 
direction, 
it 
must 
be 
the 
enemy," 
repeated 
Rostov.

"It 
may 
be 
he 
or 
it 
may 
be 
nothing," 
muttered 
the 
hussar. 
"It's
dark... 
Steady!" 
he 
cried 
to 
his 
fidgeting 
horse.

Rostov's 
horse 
was 
also 
getting 
restive: 
it 
pawed 
the 
frozen 
ground,
pricking 
its 
ears 
at 
the 
noise 
and 
looking 
at 
the 
lights. 
The 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/byy9iOfK5a.html">shouting
grew</a> 
still 
louder 
and 
merged 
into 
a 
general 
roar 
that 
only 
an 
army
of 
several 
thousand 
men 
could<p>
produce. 
The 
lights 
spread 
farther 
and
farther, 
probably 
along 
the 
line 
of 
the 
French 
camp. 
Rostov 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/rz63KSVyY0ws.html">no</a> 
longer
wanted 
to 
sleep. 
The 
gay 
triumphant 
shouting 
of 
the 
enemy 
army 
had 
a
stimulating 
effect 
on 
him. 
"Vive 
l'Empereur! 
l'Empereur!" 
he 
now
heard 
distinctly.

"They 
can't 
be 
far 
off, 
probably 
just 
beyond 
the 
stream," 
he 
said
to 
the 
hussar 
beside 
him.

The 
hussar 
only 
sighed 
without 
replying 
and 
coughed 
angrily. 
The 
sound
of 
horse's 
hoofs 
approaching 
at 
a 
trot 
along 
the 
line 
of 
hussars 
was

out

the 
foggy 
darkness 
the 
figure 
of 
a 
sergeant 
of 
hussars
suddenly 
appeared, 
looming 
huge 
as 
an 
elephant.

"Your

an

Countess 
Rostova.

"Allow 
me 
to

you 
to 
my 
daughter," 
said 
the 
countess, 
with
heightened 
color.

"I 
have 
the 
pleasure

said 
Prince 
Andrew 
with 
<a href="/cZl/HnB6Ikp4pWxqu4Ujvc.html">a</a> 
low 
and

bow 
quite
belying 
Peronskaya's

rudeness,

Natasha 
he 
held 
out 
his 
arm 
to 
grasp 
her 
waist 
before 
he 
had 
completed
his 
invitation. 
He 
asked 
her 
to 
waltz. 
That 
tremulous 
expression 
on
Natasha's 
face, 
prepared 
either 
for 
despair 
or 
rapture, 
suddenly
brightened 
into 
a 
happy, 
grateful, 
childlike 
smile.

"I 
have 
long 
been 
waiting 
for 
you," 
that 
frightened 
happy 
little
girl 
<a href="/cZl/ha5AzQCY6m9KtaDS.html">seemed</a> 
to 
say 
by 
the 
smile 
that 
replaced 
the 
threatened 
tears, 
as
she 
raised 
her 
hand 
to 
Prince 
Andrew's 
shoulder. 
They 
were 
the 
second
couple 
to 
enter 
the 
circle. 
Prince 
Andrew 
was 
one 
of 
the 
best 
dancers 
of
his 
day 
and 
Natasha 
danced 
exquisitely. 
Her 
little 
feet 
in 
their 
white
satin 
dancing 
shoes 
did 
their 
work 
swiftly, 
lightly, 
and 
independently
of 
herself, 
while 
her 
face 
beamed 
with 
ecstatic 
happiness. 
Her 
slender
bare 
arms 
and 
neck 
were 
not 
beautiful-compared 
to 
Helene's 
her
shoulders 
looked 
thin 
and 
her 
bosom 
undeveloped. 
But 
Helene 
seemed, 
as
it 
were, 
hardened 
by 
a 
varnish 
left 
by 
the 
thousands 
of 
looks 
that 
had
scanned 
her 
person, 
while 
Natasha 
was 
like 
a 
girl 
exposed 
for 
the<p>
first
time, 
who 
would 
have 
felt 
very 
much 
ashamed 
had 
she 
not 
been 
assured
that 
this 
was 
absolutely 
necessary.

Prince 
Andrew 
liked 
dancing, 
and 
wishing 
to 
escape 
as 
quickly 
as
possible 
from 
the 
political 
and 
clever 
talk 
which 
everyone 
addressed
to 
him, 
wishing 
also 
to 
break 
up 
the 
circle 
of 
restraint 
he 
disliked,
caused 
by 
the 
Emperor's 
presence, 
he 
danced, 
and 
had 
chosen 
Natasha
because 
Pierre 
pointed 
her 
out 
to 
him 
and 
because 
she 
was 
the 
<a href="/aVzUge/mbm6iCtOt1bvO1.html">first
pretty</a> 
girl 
who 
caught 
his 
eye; 
but 
scarcely 
had 
he 
embraced 
that
slender 
supple 
figure 
and 
felt 
her 
stirring 
so 
close 
to 
him 
and 
smiling
so 
near 
him 
than 
the 
wine 
of 
her 
charm 
rose 
to 
his 
head, 
and 
he
felt 
himself 
revived 
and 
rejuvenated 
when 
after 
leaving 
her 
he 
stood
breathing 
deeply 
and 
watching 
the 
other 
dancers.

After 
Prince 
Andrew, 
Boris 
came 
up 
to 
ask 
Natasha 
for

then 
the 
aide-de-camp

in 
the 
weary

that 
looked 
over 
her

Sonya 
read 
all 
that 
the 
countess 
meant 
to 
convey 
with 
these 
words. 
Those
eyes 
expressed 
entreaty, 
shame 
at

fear 
of 
a 
refusal, 
and
readiness 
for

Sonya 
went 
up

and, 
kneeling

kissed 
her

"Yes, 
Mamma,

had 
occurred 
that
day, 
especially 
by 
the 
mysterious 
fulfillment 
she 
had 
just 
seen 
of 
her
vision. 
Now

<a href="/c8Rhi6R/vu9bE2KA0AjGP.html">the</a> 
renewal 
of 
Natasha's 
relations 
with
Prince 
Andrew 
would 
prevent 
Nicholas 
from 
marrying 
Princess 
Mary, 
she
was 
joyfully 
conscious 
of 
a

of 
that 
self-sacrificing 
spirit 
in
which 
she 
was

So 
with 
a 
joyful
consciousness 
of 
performing 
a 
magnanimous 
deed-interrupted 
several 
times
by 
the 
tears 
that 
dimmed 
her 
velvety 
black

wrote 
that 
touching
letter 
the 
arrival 
of 
which 
had 
so 
amazed 
Nicholas.





CHAPTER 
IX

The 
officer 
and 
soldiers 
who 
had 
arrested 
Pierre 
treated 
him 
with
hostility 
but 
yet 
with 
respect, 
<a href="/cZl/Ga6ws1ogilO4rhMF.html">in</a> 
the 
guardhouse 
to 
which 
he 
was 
taken.
In 
their 
attitude 
toward 
him 
could 
still 
be 
felt 
both 
uncertainty 
as
to 
who 
he 
might 
be-perhaps 
a 
very 
important 
person-and 
hostility 
as 
a
result 
of 
their 
recent 
personal 
conflict 
with 
him.

But 
when 
the 
guard 
<a href="/aVzUge/vV5z2XHd9BwgT.html">was</a> 
relieved 
next 
morning, 
Pierre 
felt 
that 
for 
the
new 
guard-both 
officers 
and 
men-he 
was 
not 
as 
interesting 
as 
he 
had
been 
to 
his 
captors; 
and 
in 
fact 
the 
guard 
of 
the 
second 
<a href="/aVzUge/lX3eplAZ1Im2mGGRm.html">day</a> 
did 
not
recognize 
in 
this 
big, 
stout 
man 
in 
a 
peasant 
coat 
the 
vigorous 
person
who 
had 
fought 
so 
desperately 
with 
the 
marauder 
and 
the 
convoy 
and 
had
uttered 
those

of 
the 
captured 
Russians, 
arrested 
and 
detained 
for 
some 
reason
by 
order 
of 
the 
Higher 
Command. 
If 
they 
noticed 
anything 
remarkable
about 
Pierre, 
it 
was 
only 
his 
unabashed, 
meditative 
concentration
and 
thoughtfulness, 
and 
the 
way 
he 
spoke 
French, 
which 
struck 
them 
as
surprisingly 
good. 
In 
spite 
of

It 
was 
evident
that 
she

not

her

bring 
her 
so 
far. 
Behind 
her 
in
the 
<a href="/cZl/Bh2bI7WG6DbPtL.html">doorway</a> 
appeared 
a 
student 
with 
a 
crimson

an 
officer
of 
the 
Guards, 
a 
girl 
of 
fifteen, 
and 
a 
plump 
rosy-faced 
boy 
in 
a 
short
jacket.

The 
count 
jumped 
up 
and, 
swaying 
from 
side 
to 
side, 
spread 
his 
arms 
wide
and 
threw 
them 
round 
the 
little 
girl 
who 
had 
run 
in.

"Ah, 
here 
she 
is!" 
he 
exclaimed 
laughing. 
"My

My

"Ma 
chere, 
there 
is

said 
the

with
feigned 
severity.

the

"What

she 
added,

the

This 
black-eyed, 
wide-mouthed

not

full 
of 
life-with

<a href="/cZl/UJ9Nec8sCi3cYy.html">hastily</a>

"Second

he 
continued 
dictating

"The

"One<p>

said 
the 
clerk, 
glancing
angrily 
and 
disrespectfully 
at 
Kozlovski.

Through 
the 
door 
came 
the 
sounds 
of 
Kutuzov's 
voice, 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bS3VwPy09.html">excited</a> 
and
dissatisfied, 
interrupted 
by 
another, 
an 
unfamiliar 
voice. 
From 
the
sound 
of 
these 
voices, 
the 
inattentive 
way 
Kozlovski 
looked 
at 
him, 
the
disrespectful 
manner 
of 
the 
exhausted 
clerk, 
the 
fact 
that 
the 
clerk

Kozlovski 
were 
squatting 
on 
the 
floor 
by 
a 
tub 
so 
near 
to 
the

from 
the 
noisy 
laughter 
of 
the 
Cossacks 
holding 
the
horses 
near 
the 
window, 
Prince 
Andrew 
felt 
that 
something 
important 
and
disastrous 
was 
about 
to 
happen.

He 
turned 
to 
Kozlovski 
with 
urgent 
questions.

"Immediately, 
Prince," 
said 
Kozlovski. 
"Dispositions 
for
Bagration."

"What 
about 
capitulation?"

"Nothing 
of 
the 
sort. 
Orders 
are 
issued 
for 
a 
battle."

Prince 
Andrew 
moved 
toward 
the 
door 
from 
whence 
voices 
were 
heard.
Just 
as 
he 
was 
going

open 
it 
the 
sounds 
ceased, 
the 
door 
opened, 
and
Kutuzov 
with 
his 
eagle 
nose 
and 
puffy 
face 
appeared 
in 
the 
doorway.
Prince 
Andrew 
stood 
right 
in 
front 
of<p>
Kutuzov 
but 
the 
expression 
of
the 
commander 
in 
chief's 
one 
sound 
eye 
showed 
him 
to 
be 
so 
preoccupied
with 
thoughts 
and 
anxieties 
as 
to 
be 
oblivious 
of 
his 
presence. 
He
looked 
straight 
at 
his 
adjutant's 
face 
without 
recognizing 
him.

"Well, 
have 
you 
finished?" 
said 
he 
to 
Kozlovski.

"One 
moment, 
your 
excellency."

Bagration, 
a 
gaunt 
middle-aged 
man 
of 
medium 
height 
with 
a 
firm,
impassive 
face 
of 
Oriental 
type, 
came 
out 
after 
the 
commander 
in 
chief.

"I 
have 
the 
honor 
to 
present 
myself," 
repeated 
Prince 
Andrew 
rather
loudly, 
handing 
Kutuzov 
an 
envelope.

"Ah, 
from 
Vienna? 
Very 
good. 
Later, 
later!"

Kutuzov 
went 
out 
into 
the 
porch 
with 
Bagration.

"Well, 
good-by, 
Prince," 
said 
he 
to 
Bagration. 
"My 
blessing, 
and
may<p>
Christ 
be 
with 
you 
in 
your 
great 
endeavor!"

His 
face 
suddenly 
softened 
and 
tears 
came 
into 
his 
eyes. 
With 
his 
left
hand 
he 
drew 
Bagration 
toward 
him, 
and 
with 
his 
right, 
on 
which 
he 
wore
a 
ring, 
he 
made 
the 
sign 
of 
the 
cross 
over 
him 
with 
a 
gesture 
evidently
habitual, 
offering 
his 
puffy 
cheek, 
but 
Bagration 
kissed 
him 
on 
the
neck 
instead.

"Christ 
be 
with 
you!" 
Kutuzov 
repeated 
and 
went 
toward 
his
carriage. 
"Get 
in 
with 
me," 
said 
he 
to 
Bolkonski.

"Your

Allow 
me

remain
with

Bagration's 
detachment."

"Get

said 
Kutuzov, 
and 
noticing 
that 
Bolkonski 
still 
delayed,

divided 
into

unequal

our
Pavlograd 
regiment; 
the 
other, 
all

And 
the

was 
no

In

CHAPTER 
VII

On 
the 
twelfth 
of 
November, 
Kutuzov's 
active 
army, 
in 
camp 
before
Olmuetz, 
was 
preparing 
to 
be 
reviewed 
next 
day 
by 
the 
two 
Emperors-the
Russian 
and 
the 
Austrian. 
The 
Guards, 
just 
arrived 
from 
Russia, 
spent
the 
night 
ten 
miles 
from 
Olmuetz 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/NI5dBoY8m.html">and</a> 
next 
morning 
were 
to 
come 
straight
to 
the 
review, 
reaching 
the 
field 
at 
Olmuetz 
by 
ten 
o'clock.

That 
day 
Nicholas 
Rostov 
received 
a 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/Kt1fqZYy6E2U.html">letter</a> 
from 
Boris, 
telling 
him
that 
the 
Ismaylov 
regiment 
was 
quartered 
for 
the 
night 
ten 
miles 
from
Olmuetz 
and 
that 
he 
wanted 
to 
see 
him 
as 
he 
had 
a 
letter 
and 
money 
for
him. 
Rostov 
was 
particularly 
in 
need 
of 
money 
now 
that 
the 
troops,
after 
their 
active 
service, 
were 
stationed 
near 
Olmuetz 
and 
the 
camp
swarmed 
with 
well-provisioned 
sutlers 
and 
Austrian 
Jews 
offering
all 
sorts 
of 
tempting 
wares. 
The 
Pavlograds 
held 
feast 
after 
feast,
celebrating 
awards 
they 
had 
received 
for 
the 
campaign, 
and 
made
expeditions 
to 
Olmuetz 
to 
visit 
a 
certain 
Caroline 
the 
Hungarian,
who 
had 
recently 
opened 
a 
restaurant 
there 
with 
girls 
as 
waitresses.
Rostov, 
who 
had 
just 
celebrated 
his 
promotion 
to 
a 
cornetcy 
<a href="/c8Rhi6R/bUI9RijOU2QrO7iY.html">and</a> 
bought
Denisov's 
horse, 
Bedouin, 
was 
in 
debt 
all 
round, 
to 
his 
comrades 
and
the 
sutlers. 
On 
receiving 
Boris' 
letter 
he 
rode 
with 
a 
fellow 
officer
to 
Olmuetz, 
dined 
there, 
drank 
a 
bottle 
of 
wine, 
and 
then 
set 
off 
alone
to 
the 
Guards' 
camp 
to 
find 
his<p>
old 
playmate. 
Rostov 
had 
not 
yet 
had
time 
to 
get 
his 
uniform. 
He 
had 
on 
a 
shabby 
cadet 
jacket, 
decorated 
with
a 
soldier's 
cross, 
equally 
shabby 
cadet's 
riding 
breeches 
lined 
with
worn 
leather, 
and 
an 
officer's 
saber 
with 
a 
sword 
knot. 
The 
Don 
horse
he 
was 
riding 
was

from

a

to

The

stopped, 
facing 
the 
Cossack,
and 
examined 
him 
with 
attentive 
curiosity. 
The 
Cossack 
was 
dead, 
but 
the
horse 
still 
struggled.

Prince 
Bagration 
screwed 
up 
his 
eyes, 
looked 
round, 
and, 
seeing 
the
cause 
of 
the 
confusion, 
turned 
away 
with 
indifference, 
as 
if 
to 
say,
"Is 
it 
worth 
while 
noticing 
trifles?" 
He 
reined 
in 
his 
horse 
with
the 
care 
of 
a 
skillful 
rider 
and, 
slightly 
bending 
over, 
disengaged 
his
saber 
which 
had<p>
caught 
in 
his 
cloak. 
It 
was 
an 
old-fashioned 
saber 
of
a 
kind 
no 
longer 
in 
general 
use. 
Prince 
Andrew 
remembered 
the 
story 
of
Suvorov 
giving 
his 
saber 
to<p>
Bagration 
in<p>
Italy, 
and 
the 
recollection
was 
particularly 
pleasant 
at 
that 
moment. 
They 
had 
reached 
the 
battery
at 
which 
Prince 
Andrew 
had 
been 
when 
he 
examined 
the 
battlefield.

"Whose 
company?" 
asked 
Prince 
Bagration 
of 
an 
artilleryman 
standing
by 
the 
ammunition 
wagon.

He 
asked, 
"Whose

but 
he 
really 
meant, 
"Are 
you
frightened 
here?" 
and 
the 
artilleryman 
understood 
him.

"Captain 
Tushin's, 
your

shouted 
the 
red-haired,
freckled 
gunner 
in 
a 
merry 
voice, 
standing 
to 
attention.

"Yes, 
yes," 
muttered 
Bagration 
as 
if 
considering 
something, 
and 
he
rode 
past 
the 
limbers 
to 
the 
farthest 
cannon.

As 
he 
approached, 
a 
ringing 
shot 
issued 
from 
it 
deafening 
him 
and 
his
suite, 
and 
in 
the 
smoke 
that 
suddenly 
surrounded 
the 
gun 
they 
could 
see
the 
gunners 
who 
had 
seized 
it 
straining 
to 
roll 
it 
quickly 
back 
to 
its
former 
position. 
A 
huge, 
broad-shouldered 
gunner, 
Number 
One, 
holding
a 
mop, 
his 
legs 
far 
apart, 
sprang 
to 
the 
wheel; 
while 
Number 
Two 
with
a 
trembling 
hand 
placed 
a 
charge 
in 
the 
cannon's 
mouth. 
The 
short,
round-shouldered 
Captain 
Tushin, 
stumbling 
over 
the 
tail 
of 
the 
gun
carriage, 
moved 
forward 
and, 
not 
noticing 
the 
general, 
looked 
out
shading 
his 
eyes 
with 
his 
small 
hand.

"Lift 
it 
two 
lines 
more 
and 
it 
will 
be 
just 
right," 
cried 
he 
in 
a
feeble 
voice 
to 
which 
he 
tried 
to 
impart 
a 
dashing 
note, 
ill-suited 
to
his 
weak 
figure. 
"Number 
Two!" 
he 
squeaked. 
"Fire, 
Medvedev!"

Bagration 
called 
to 
him, 
and 
Tushin, 
raising 
three 
fingers 
to 
his 
cap
with 
a 
bashful 
and 
awkward 
gesture 
not 
at 
all 
like 
a 
military 
salute
but 
like 
a 
priest's 
benediction, 
approached 
the 
general. 
Though
Tushin's 
guns 
had 
been 
intended 
to 
cannonade 
the 
valley, 
he 
was

incendiary 
balls

When 
Michael 
Ivanovich 
went 
in 
there 
were 
tears 
in 
the

by 
the 
memory 
of 
the 
time 
when 
the 
paper 
he 
was 
now 
reading 
had
been 
written. 
He 
took 
the 
letter 
from 
Michael 
Ivanovich's 
hand, 
put 
it
in 
his 
pocket, 
folded 
up 
his 
papers, 
and 
called 
in 
Alpatych 
who 
had 
long
been 
waiting.

The 
prince 
had 
a 
list 
of 
things 
to 
be 
bought 
in 
Smolensk 
and, 
walking
up 
and 
down 
the 
room 
past 
Alpatych 
who 
stood 
by 
the 
door, 
he 
gave 
his
instructions.

"First, 
notepaper-do 
you 
hear? 
Eight 
quires, 
like 
this 
sample,
gilt-edged... 
it 
must 
be 
exactly 
like 
the 
sample. 
Varnish, 
sealing 
wax,
as 
in 
Michael 
Ivanovich's 
list."

He 
paced 
up 
and 
down 
for 
a 
while 
and 
glanced 
<a href="/cZl/tE3iLv7to9sVlKw.html">at</a> 
his 
notes.

"Then 
hand 
to 
the 
governor 
in 
person 
a 
letter 
about 
the 
deed."

Next, 
bolts 
for 
the 
doors 
of 
the 
new 
building 
were 
wanted 
and 
had 
to 
be
of 
a

himself 
designed, 
and 
a 
leather 
case
had 
to 
be 
ordered 
to 
keep 
the 
"will" 
in.

The 
instructions 
to 
Alpatych 
took 
over 
two 
hours 
and 
still 
the 
prince
did 
not 
let 
him 
go. 
He 
sat 
down, 
sank 
into 
thought, 
closed 
his 
eyes, 
and
dozed<p>
off. 
Alpatych 
made 
a 
slight 
movement.

"Well, 
go, 
go! 
If 
anything 
more 
is 
wanted 
I'll 
send 
after 
you."

Alpatych 
went 
out. 
The 
prince 
again 
went 
to 
his 
bureau, 
glanced 
into 
it,
fingered 
his 
papers, 
closed 
the 
bureau 
again, 
and 
sat 
down 
at 
the 
table
to 
write 
to 
the

It

Napoleon,

Natasha

Petya 
promised 
to

very
soon, 
but 
as 
it 
was 
still 
early 
the 
hunt 
went 
farther. 
At 
midday
they 
put 
the 
hounds 
into 
a 
ravine 
thickly 
overgrown 
with 
young 
trees.
Nicholas 
standing 
in 
a 
fallow 
field 
could 
see 
all 
his 
whips.

Facing 
him 
lay 
a 
<a href="/aVzUge/zp4qQqw29HrxvL.html">field</a> 
of 
winter 
rye, 
there 
his

huntsman 
stood 
alone

a

a

trousers 
had 
worked 
up 
to 
above 
his 
knees. 
Behind 
him,
standing 
in 
the 
stirrups, 
trotted 
a 
Cossack. 
The 
officer, 
a 
very 
young
lad 
with 
a 
broad 
rosy 
face 
and 
keen 
merry 
eyes, 
galloped 
up 
to 
Denisov
and 
handed 
him<p>
a 
sodden 
envelope.

"From 
the 
general," 
said 
the 
officer. 
"Please 
excuse 
its 
not 
being 
quite
dry."

Denisov, 
frowning, 
took 
the 
envelope 
and 
opened 
it.

"There, 
they 
kept 
telling 
us: 
'It's 
dangerous, 
it's 
dangerous,'"
said 
the 
officer, 
addressing 
the 
esaul 
while 
Denisov 
was 
reading 
the
dispatch. 
"But 
Komarov 
and 
I"-he 
pointed 
to 
the 
Cossack-"were 
prepared.
We 
have 
each 
of 
us 
two 
pistols.... 
But 
what's 
this?" 
he 
asked, 
noticing
the 
French 
drummer 
boy. 
"A 
prisoner? 
You've 
already 
been 
in 
action? 
May
I 
speak 
to 
him?"

"Wostov! 
Petya!" 
exclaimed 
Denisov, 
having 
run 
through 
the 
dispatch.
"Why 
didn't 
you 
say 
who 
you 
were?" 
and 
turning 
with 
a 
smile 
he 
held 
out
his 
hand 
to 
the 
lad.

The 
officer 
was 
Petya 
Rostov.

All 
the 
way 
Petya 
had 
been 
preparing 
himself 
to 
behave 
with 
Denisov 
as
befitted 
a 
grown-up 
man 
and 
an 
officer-without 
hinting 
at 
their 
previous
acquaintance. 
But 
as 
soon 
as 
Denisov 
smiled 
at 
him 
Petya 
brightened
up, 
blushed 
with 
pleasure, 
forgot 
the 
official 
manner 
he 
had 
been
rehearsing, 
and 
began 
telling 
him 
how 
he 
had 
already 
been 
in 
a 
battle
near 
Vyazma 
and 
how 
a 
certain 
hussar 
had 
distinguished 
himself 
there.

"Well, 
I 
am 
glad 
to 
see 
you," 
Denisov 
interrupted 
him, 
and 
his 
face
again 
assumed 
its 
anxious 
expression.

"Michael 
Feoklitych," 
said 
he 
to 
the 
esaul, 
"this 
is 
again 
fwom 
that
German, 
you 
know. 
He"-he 
indicated 
Petya-"is 
serving 
under 
him."

And 
Denisov 
told 
the 
esaul 
that 
the 
dispatch 
just 
delivered 
was 
a
repetition 
of 
the 
German 
general's 
demand 
that 
he 
should 
join 
forces
with 
him 
for 
an 
attack 
on 
the 
transport.

"If 
we 
don't 
take 
it 
tomowwow, 
he'll 
snatch 
it 
fwom

our 
noses," 
he
added.

While 
Denisov 
was 
talking 
to 
the 
esaul, 
Petya-abashed 
by<p>
Denisov's
cold 
tone 
and 
supposing 
that 
it 
was 
due 
to<p>
the 
condition 
of 
his
trousers-furtively 
tried 
to 
pull 
them 
down 
under 
his 
greatcoat 
so
that 
no 
one 
should 
notice 
it, 
while 
maintaining 
as 
martial 
an 
air 
as
possible.

"Will 
there 
be 
any 
orders, 
your 
honor?" 
he 
asked 
Denisov, 
holding 
his
hand 
at 
the 
salute 
and 
resuming 
the 
game 
of 
adjutant 
and 
general 
for
which 
he 
had 
prepared 
himself, 
"or 
shall
