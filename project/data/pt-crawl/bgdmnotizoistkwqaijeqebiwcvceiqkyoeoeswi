something. 
Prince 
Andrew 
stepped 
forward 
from 
among 
the
suite 
and 
said 
in 
French:

"You 
told 
me 
to 
remind 
you 
of 
the 
officer 
Dolokhov, 
reduced 
to 
the
ranks<p>
in 
this 
regiment."

"Where 
is 
Dolokhov?" 
asked 
Kutuzov.

Dolokhov, 
who 
had 
already 
changed 
into 
a 
soldier's 
gray 
greatcoat,
did<p>
not 
wait 
to 
be 
called. 
The 
shapely 
figure 
<a href="/CN9CmwX.html">of</a> 
the 
fair-haired
soldier,<p>
with 
his 
clear 
blue 
eyes, 
stepped 
forward 
from 
the 
<a href="/CN9CmwX.html">ranks,</a> 
went
up 
to 
the 
commander 
in 
chief, 
and 
presented 
arms.

"Have 
you 
a 
complaint 
to 
make?" 
Kutuzov 
asked 
with 
a 
slight 
frown.

"This 
is 
Dolokhov," 
said 
Prince 
Andrew.

"Ah!" 
said 
Kutuzov. 
"I 
hope 
this 
will 
be 
a 
lesson 
to 
you. 
Do 
your
duty. 
The 
Emperor 
is 
gracious, 
and 
I 
shan't 
forget 
you 
if 
you 
deserve
well."

The 
clear 
blue 
eyes 
looked 
at 
the 
commander 
in 
chief 
just 
as 
boldly 
as
they 
had 
looked 
at 
the 
regimental 
commander, 
seeming 
by 
their 
expression
to 
tear 
open 
the 
veil 
of 
convention 
that 
separates 
a 
commander 
in 
chief
so 
widely 
from 
a 
private.

"One 
thing 
I 
ask 
of 
your 
excellency," 
Dolokhov 
said 
in 
his 
firm,
ringing, 
deliberate 
voice. 
"I 
ask 
an 
opportunity 
to 
atone 
for 
my 
fault
and 
prove 
my 
devotion 
to 
His 
Majesty 
the 
Emperor 
and 
to 
<a href="/ND3.html">Russia!"

Kutuzov</a> 
turned 
away. 
The 
same 
smile 
of 
the 
eyes 
with 
which 
he 
had
turned 
from 
Captain 
Timokhin 
again 
flitted 
over 
his 
face. 
He 
turned
away 
with 
a 
grimace<p>
as 
if 
to 
say 
that 
everything 
Dolokhov 
had 
said 
to
him 
and 
everything 
he 
could 
say 
had 
long 
been 
known 
to 
him, 
that 
he 
was
weary 
of 
it 
and 
it 
was 
not 
at 
all 
what 
he 
wanted. 
He 
turned 
away 
and
went 
to 
the 
carriage.

The 
regiment 
broke 
up 
into 
companies, 
which 
went 
to 
their 
appointed
quarters 
near 
Braunau, 
where 
they 
hoped 
to 
receive 
boots 
and 
clothes 
and
to 
rest 
after 
their 
hard 
marches.

"You 
won't 
bear 
me 
a 
grudge, 
Prokhor 
Ignatych?" 
said 
the
regimental 
commander,
